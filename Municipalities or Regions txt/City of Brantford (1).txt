Active Transportation
Active transportation is any form of people-powered transportation like walking,
cycling, skateboarding, rollerblading, and wheelchair use. This can include walking
to a bus stop or cycling to work or school.
The City is working to make travel by active modes the preferred choice for
residents, especially for trips within five km. If more people choose people-powered
transportation over driving, we can help ease congestion on city streets, create a
cleaner environment, and support a healthier community. Learn more about the
City's active and sustainable transportation options.

How the City is supporting active transportation
initiatives:
         We are working with partners to educate citizens about how to share the
         road safely with cyclists, how to ride safely and how to prevent collisions.
         We have committed to various planning principles such as Vision
         Zero and Complete Streets to guide the way we build our streets and our
         City.
         We are updating our Transportation Master Plan to equally consider all
         transportation modes and to place priority on sustainable transportation
         (walking, cycling, transit).
         We are continuing to build on the cycling and pedestrian network by adding
         more bike lanes, building multi-use paths and encouraging developments to
         provide better pedestrian/cycling environments.
