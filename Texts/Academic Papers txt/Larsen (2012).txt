  This study examined environmental influences on a child’s mode of travel between home and school. Grade 7 and
  8 students (n = 614) from twenty-one schools throughout London, Ontario, participated in a school-based travel
  mode survey. Geographic information systems (GIS) were employed to examine environmental characteristics
  of the child’s mode of travel between home and school measured at the scale of the likely travel route. Logistic
  regression was used to assess what factors influence both the to- and from-school trip. Over 62 percent of students
  living within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of school walked or biked to school and 72 percent walked or biked home
  from school. Actively commuting to school was positively associated with shorter trips, with distance being
  the most important correlate. Boys were significantly more likely to use active travel modes than girls. Higher
  traffic volume along the route was negatively related to rates of active travel and children from higher income
  neighborhoods were less likely to actively travel than children from lower income neighborhoods. In terms
  of environmental characteristics, the presence of street trees was positively associated and higher residential
  densities and mixed land uses were negatively associated with active travel to school. For the journey home,
  crossing major streets and increased intersection density were negatively associated with active travel. The
  findings of this research give evidence that active travel is associated with the environmental characteristics
  of walking routes. This information should be considered for urban planning and school planning purposes to
  improve children’s walking environments. Key Words: active travel, built environment, children’s health, GIS,
  walkability.

  Ontario, participaron en un reconocimiento sobre el modo de viaje a partir de la escuela. Se emplearon sistemas
  de informacio´n geogra´fica (SIG) para examinar las caracteri´sticas ambientales del modo de viajar del nin~o entre
  la casa y la escuela, medidas a la escala de la ruta probable de viaje. Se utilizo´ la regresio´n logi´stica para evaluar
  que´ factores influyen el viaje hacia y desde la escuela. Ma´s del 62 por ciento de los estudiantes que viven hasta
  1.6 kilo´metros (1 milla) de la escuela caminaban o se desplazaban en bicicleta a la escuela, y el 72 por ciento
  caminaban o iban en cicla a la casa desde la escuela. El conmutar activamente a la escuela estaba positivamente
  asociado con viajes ma´s cortos, siendo en este caso la distancia el factor de correlacio´n ma´s importante. Los

All data for this study were updated in autumn of 2006.
Finally, data on crime were based on reported residential
burglaries obtained from the London Police Services, for
the years 1998 through 2003. Crime data were geocoded
to the appropriate street segment, and the number of in-
cidents per segment was summed for the six years of data.
To improve the accuracy of likely pedestrian routes, the
study went beyond previous efforts that define poten-
tial travel routes using the street network only. Previous
work has calculated the shortest path between home
and school based on the road network. Most road net-
works do not include pedestrian walkways, sidewalks,
or informal pathways commonly used for the journey to
school. Here, a “circulation system” file was built using
a combination of the street network, trails, and path-
ways file. These data were manually updated to ensure
accuracy using 2007 aerial photography (15-cm resolu-
tion) and field surveys. This file allowed researchers to
determine all possible walking routes, including infor-
mal pathways such as shortcuts through parks, school-
yards, and so on, within the city. Network analysis was
employed within a GIS to calculate the shortest path
between each respondent’s home postal code and his or
her school using the circulation system file.
    Each estimated route was then buffered by 50 me-
ters, creating a 100-meter-wide travel corridor, where
features of the built environment were examined (Fig-
ure 2). Within these corridors the pedestrian experience
was modeled through measurements of the traffic envi-
ronment, street and railway crossings, network connec-
tivity, sidewalk density, street tree density, percentage
of single detached dwellings (as a measure of density),
and land use mix. In terms of exposure to traffic, there
is little evidence-based guidance as to how traffic expo-
sure affects the decision to use active travel modes; for
example, whether average levels of exposure along the
route, or particular segments with high exposure, have
higher likely impacts. We used the latter assumption
and identified the street segment with the highest level
of traffic for each travel corridor. Additionally, to model
the impact of crossing major streets and railways, the
number of crossings of streets classified as arterial roads
or highways and active railway tracks between home
and school was assigned to each route.
    The connectivity of the circulation system along
each route was measured as the density of three- or
four-way intersections per square kilometer within each         Figure 2. Example of a route buffer: Characteristics of a child’s jour-
