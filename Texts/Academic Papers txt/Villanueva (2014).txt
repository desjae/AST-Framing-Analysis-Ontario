       The association between neighbourhood walkability and children’s independent mobility using
       an ecological approach is relatively unexplored. In 2007, 1480 10- to 12-year-old children (and
       1314 parents) attending low and high walkable schools across Perth, Western Australia,
       completed surveys. Objective built environment, social-cultural and individual-level factors
       were explored. High neighbourhood walkability predicted girls’ independent mobility.
       However, girls and boys were more likely to be independently mobile if they and their
       parents were con<U+FB01>dent that they could travel independently. Providing safe, walkable
       neighbourhoods – particularly for girls – combined with strategies to improve children’s
       skills to safely navigate their neighbourhood may increase independent mobility.

Introduction
Regular participation in physical activity during childhood reduces the risk of developing disease
risk factors in adulthood (Boreham and Riddoch 2001), enhances mental and emotional well-
being (Biddle, Gorely, and Stensel 2004; Par<U+FB01>tt and Eston 2005) and may prevent overweight
and obesity (Flynn et al. 2006). Active transportation (i.e. walking or cycling for transport) has
the potential to contribute to higher overall physical activity levels in children (Alexander
et al. 2005; Sirard et al. 2005; Cooper et al. 2006; Saksvig et al. 2007; Landsberg et al. 2008),
however children’s active transport (AT) levels have declined rapidly in the last 20 years
(Harten and Olds 2004; Salmon et al. 2005; McDonald 2007; McMillan 2007).
    Declines in active transportation have been coupled with declining levels of independent
mobility (herein abbreviated as ‘IM’) among children, that is, active transportation to destinations
undertaken without adult supervision (Pooley, Turnbull, and Adams 2005; Holt et al. 2009).
Studies have shown that children in past generations experienced more freedom to move and
explore their neighbourhood compared to current generations (Hillman, Adams, and Whitelegg
1990; Pooley, Turnbull, and Adams 2005). These trends are mirrored by dramatic increases in

motorised vehicle use (Mackett 2002; Ham, Martin, and Kohl 2008) and increases in parents
chauffeuring children to destinations (Ker and Tranter 1997; Tudor-Locke 2001; McKee et al.
2007; Martin et al. 2009). In addition to reducing physical activity (Wen et al. 2009; Page
et al. 2010), reduced IM may limit self-esteem (Joshi, MacClean, and Carter 1999), hamper
spatial skills (e.g. distance estimation, direction, spatial referencing skills) and provide less oppor-
tunity for children to learn about their environment (Rissotto and Tonucci 2002). Thus, reduced
IM may not only affect children’s physical activity levels, but also their development and mental
and social well-being.
    In Australia, declining levels of children’s IM at a time of alarming childhood obesity levels
is a public health concern however, limited evidence exists to guide public health policy and
interventions aimed at encouraging children’s IM (Whitzman and Pike 2007; Fyhri et al.
2011). The factors that in<U+FB02>uence children’s IM and the reasons for its decline are not well
understood. To date only a limited number of international studies have comprehensively
explored the range of factors in<U+FB02>uencing children’s IM (Hillman, Adams, and Whitelegg
1990; Johansson 2006; Jago et al. 2009; Page et al. 2009), and few have taken an ecological
approach that considers the independent contributions of individual-level, social environmental
and physical environmental factors simultaneously (Johansson 2006; Fyhri and Hjorthol 2009).
Moreover, few have explored IM in an Australian context (Malone 2007; Whitzman and Pike
2007).
    Evidence to date suggests that individual-level correlates positively associated with IM
include being older, and living closer to school (Hillman, Adams, and Whitelegg 1990; Jones,
Davis, and Eyers 2000; O’Brien et al. 2000; Prezza et al. 2001; Johansson 2006; Fyhri and
Hjorthol 2009). Moreover, others have suggested that boys are more likely to be independently
mobile than girls (Johansson 2006; Page et al. 2009), typically resulting in studies exploring
any differences among sex (Brown et al. 2008). Social-cultural factors include support from
peers, parental and child fear of ‘stranger danger’ and crime (Prezza et al. 2001; Jago et al.
2009), and parent’s attitude towards IM (Johansson 2006). To date, however, the built environ-
ment has received less attention.
    The built environment has been consistently shown to be associated with children’s AT, and,
therefore, it is likely that the built environment is also an important correlate of children’s IM.
‘Walkable’ environments combine a number of built environment attributes that encourage
ease of pedestrian access and neighbourhood AT. For example, better connected street networks
have generally been shown to positively in<U+FB02>uence 9- to 11-year-old children’s AT behaviour
(Braza, Shoemaker, and Seeley 2004; Boarnet et al. 2005; Kerr et al. 2006; Falb et al. 2007;
Bejleri et al. 2009) by reducing distances to destinations and providing multiple route options
(Chin et al. 2008). Lower levels of traf<U+FB01>c exposure have also been shown to in<U+FB02>uence children’s
AT (Carlin et al. 1997; von Kries et al. 1998; Timperio et al. 2004). Although supportive built
environments are important for facilitating mobility, perceptions about the built environment
may also impact children’s autonomy (Prezza et al. 2001). For example, parental concerns
about traf<U+FB01>c safety (e.g. volume, speed, presence of obstructions on the road) are also important
factors in<U+FB02>uencing children’s mobility (Collins and Kearns 2001; Kerr et al. 2006; Weir, Etelson,
and Brand 2006).
    While associations between built environment factors and AT have been established in several
studies, few studies have examined built environment correlates of IM. Thus, using an ecological
framework, this study explored the impact of objectively measured neighbourhood walkability on
IM, independent of parental perceptions of the neighbourhood, social-cultural factors and
child-speci<U+FB01>c individual-level factors. It is hypothesised that a walkable environment increases
the likelihood of boys’ and girls’ IM.

Methods
This study formed part of the TRavel Environment and Kids (TREK) project, a cross-sectional
study conducted in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia. Its aim was to examine the impact
of the built environment on Year 5 to 7 (i.e. 10– 12 year-old) government primary school chil-
dren’s AT to and from school. Perth is an isolated, coastal city with high urban sprawl, and a rela-
tively high standard of living in a Mediterranean climate. With a population of approximately 1.7
million (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2010), Perth is one of the smaller Australian capital cities
(Giles-Corti et al. 2005). The University of Western Australia’s Human Ethics Committee pro-
vided ethics approval (RA/4/1/1394). The study design is described fully elsewhere (Wood
et al. 2010), but is described brie<U+FB02>y here. Data were collected in two stages: (1) school-speci<U+FB01>c
walkability assessment (Giles-Corti et al. 2011); and (2) a cross-sectional survey of Year 5 – 7
children and their parents (Wood et al. 2010).
Participant selection and recruitment
Using Geographic Information Systems software, a school-speci<U+FB01>c walkability index (SWI) was
developed and applied to all public primary schools in metropolitan Perth (n ¼ 238). The SWI
is described fully elsewhere (Giles-Corti et al. 2011). Brie<U+FB02>y, it summed two measures: (1) street
connectivity assessed by pedsheds (i.e. walkable service area based on pedestrian network up to
2 km in any direction from the school, divided by the actual area within 2 km Euclidean (as
crow <U+FB02>ies) distance of the school (Chin et al. 2008); and (2) road volume exposure, a measure of
road function detailing exposure to number of vehicles/day based on Main Roads Department of
Western Australia’s Functional Road Hierarchy, within 2 km of each school using the road and ped-
estrian networks. Using the functional road function hierarchy, a ratio of kilometres of the higher
volume roads (i.e. roads that carry large volumes of traf<U+FB01>c; .6000 vehicles/day) to kilometres of
the lower volume roads (i.e. roads that carry low volumes of traf<U+FB01>c; ,3000 vehicles/day) within
2 km of the school was calculated. Schools ranked as the most (high street connectivity, low
traf<U+FB01>c exposure) and the least (low street connectivity, high traf<U+FB01>c exposure) walkable schools
from within the three area-level socio-economic status (SES) strata (i.e. low, medium, high),
were selected and invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey (n ¼ 36 schools). For each par-
ticipating school (n ¼ 25; 69.4% response rate), one class from each Year 5, Year 6 and Year 7
group was randomly selected until a minimum of 30 children were invited from each year group
(n ¼ 2617). This age group was chosen because ‘middle childhood’ marks the time when
parents grant their children more independence to explore their local neighbourhood (Hillman,
Adams, and Whitelegg 1990; Jago et al. 2009). Moreover, children above the age of 10 years
have the cognitive (attention focus, interpreting traf<U+FB01>c signs) and perceptual (locating sounds,
judging speed and peripheral vision) abilities to negotiate complex traf<U+FB01>c situations (Cross et al.
2000) and are considered more ‘streetwise’ (i.e. capable of handling the environment) (Prezza
et al. 2001). Overall, 1480 children (56.5% response rate) and 1314 parents (89.6% response
rate of parents of participating children) provided written consent and participated.
     School-speci<U+FB01>c walkability was used as a proxy for the walkability of the child’s neighbour-
hood for children who resided within 2 km of their school (n ¼ 1254, 84.7% of sample). Children
who did not reside within the zone were excluded from analyses (n ¼ 226, 15.3%).
Survey data collection
Questionnaire data were collected between July and December 2007. Children completed ques-
tionnaires during a 75-minute classroom session, and parents completed a questionnaire at home.
Test – retest reliability of relevant items was assessed one week apart in four schools not included

396       K. Villanueva et al.
in the main study (n ¼ 160 10- to 12-year-old children, n ¼ 101 parents) prior to the main survey.
Items with acceptable reliability (i.e. kappa or intraclass correlation (ICC) . 0.60) were included
in the <U+FB01>nal survey instruments, and items ,0.60 were modi<U+FB01>ed to enhance their reliability. Modi-
<U+FB01>ed items were re-tested for reliability (Wood et al. 2010).
Outcome variable (Independent mobility)
An IM index was computed using questions from both the student and the parent questionnaire.
Children indicated whether or not they participated in or visited (walked or cycled) 15 activities
or destinations (excluding trips to school) in their neighbourhood in the last week and parents indi-
cated whether or not their child was generally allowed to participate or visit each of these without an
adult (Figure 1). A score based on the number of activities or destinations in which they participated
and were allowed to do/visit without an adult was computed in accordance with Figure 1. Potential
scores could range from 0 (i.e. no independent active travel to any activity or destination) to 15.
Independent variables
Participants were administered 37 potentially relevant variables, of which 21 were included in six
subscales. The components of each subscale are described in Table 1. Using SPSS v17, principal
components analysis with a varimax or oblimin rotation (depending on how correlated the items
were) was performed on three groups of variables (total 21 items, 8 of which were reverse coded
so that a higher score represented positive IM) to reduce the number of items into related factors.
The resulting scree plots, Eigen values and factor loadings were examined. Factors were deter-
mined based on Eigen values . 1, factor loadings . 0.40 and on a single factor. Perceived
environmental factors, social-cultural factors, and individual factors are described in more
detail below. Reliability results for each factor (i.e. Kappa and ICC values) are also reported.
Perceived environmental factors
Parental perceptions of the environment were assessed with seven items. Parents were asked
‘Which of the following best describes the location of your home?’ (i.e. on a highway or on a

busy road (not on a highway) rather than a minor road (50 km/hr speed limit), in a cul-de-sac or
within a school zone (40 km speed limit in school hours)). Responses were dichotomised into the
variable ‘Home on a busy road’ (Yes/No, Kappa 0.697). Parents were asked ‘Is your backyard
large enough and suitable for children to run around’ (Yes/No, Kappa 0.759) and ‘How fearful
are you that if your child walked or rode a bike in your neighbourhood without an adult s/he
or she may cross the road unsafely’ (Not very fearful/fearful, Kappa 0.472). Parents were also
asked four items relating to neighbourhood friendliness (scale ICC 0.544, Cronbach’s a ¼
0.75) and two items relating to safety of neighbourhood road crossings (scale ICC 0.540, Cron-
bach’s a ¼ 076). Response options were provided on a <U+FB01>ve-point Likert scale and summed for
each of the two subscales (Table 1).
      Children indicated how much they agreed or disagreed (i.e. Likert scale 1 ¼ strongly disagree to
5 ¼ strongly agree, don’t know) with six items: (1) ‘I am worried about strangers in my neighbour-
hood’ (ICC 0.685); (2) ‘It is safe for me to play at the park closest to my house without an adult
present’ (ICC 0.704); (3) ‘The park closest to my house has fun or interesting things for me to

do’(ICC 0.0.560); (4) ‘My neighbourhood is a nice place to walk around’ (ICC 0.576); (5) ‘My neigh-
bourhood is friendly’ (ICC 0.651); and (6) ‘You often see people out on walks in my neighbourhood’
(ICC 0.0.648). Principal components analysis results suggested that the items loaded on one factor,
however upon creation of the scale, the Cronbach’s alpha value was low (i.e. below 0.7) indicating
that the variables may not be measuring the same construct, and were, therefore, used as individual
variables. Children were also asked two items related to con<U+FB01>dence in travelling to the local shops
independently (scale ICC 0.742, Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.86) and two items relating to the amount of
time taken to travel to the local shops (scale ICC 0.520, Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.76). Response options
were provided on a <U+FB01>ve-point Likert scale and summed for each of the two subscales (Table 1).
Social-cultural and Individual factors
Two subscales were created from eleven social-cultural parent questionnaire items detailed in
Table 1: ‘Not fearful of child’s personal safety in neighbourhood’ (eight items, scale ICC
0.832, Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.92); and ‘Fearful of child engaging in antisocial behaviour’ (three
items, scale ICC 0.739, Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.94). Parents were also asked about the ‘Number of
children living in the house’ (one to six, ICC 0.940). Three single items measured children’s indi-
vidual perceptions: (1) ‘Child has many friends in the neighbourhood’ (Yes/No, Kappa ¼ 0.758);
(2) ‘Child has lots of children their own age to hang out with in their area’ (Yes/No, Kappa ¼
0.727); and (3) ‘Child has access to a bike at home to ride’ (Yes/No, Kappa ¼ 0.734).
Bivariate and multivariate analyses
SPSS v17 and Stata/IC 11.0 for Windows were used. Only children who resided within 2 km of
the school with an IM score (n ¼ 1061) were eligible for analyses. Bivariate comparisons
between individual, social-cultural, perceived environmental and objective variables (e.g.
SWI), and IM were examined using Pearson’s chi-square and Independent t-tests (Table 3). Vari-
ables with p-values .0.1 were excluded from further multivariate analyses. Backward stepwise
entry of correlates into the logistic regression model were manually undertaken to estimate the
odds of some versus no IM in the last week (Tables 4 and 5). Classes of independent factors
were sequentially entered into the models – objective environment (model 1), perceived environ-
ment (model 2), social-cultural factors (model 3) and individual factors (model 4). All models
were adjusted for highest level of maternal education, the child’s school year and whether or
not the child was sick in the week prior to survey data collection, and robust standard errors
for parameter estimates were obtained using the ‘cluster by (school)’ command (in Stata) allowing
for intra-school correlation so observations are independent across schools. Due to documented
sex variation in IM (O’Brien et al. 2000; Mackett et al. 2007), analyses were strati<U+FB01>ed by sex.
Mediation analyses were undertaken among girls only using the Baron and Kenny approach
(Baron and Kenny 1986) and tested for signi<U+FB01>cance, using the Sobel test (Preacher and Hayes
2004). Moreover, the proportion of the effect mediated was calculated (MacKinnon, Fairchild,
and Fritz 2007).
Results
Sample description
There were no signi<U+FB01>cant demographic differences between boys and girls (Table 2). Approxi-
mately equal proportion of boys and girls attended low, medium and high SES schools. A
higher proportion of boys (26.5%) than girls (19.7%) indicated that they were sick in the week
preceding the data collection (p , 0.05).

Independent mobility
Children’s IM scores as computed using the index (Figure 1), ranged from 0 to 10 (mean 1.57, SD
1.48), 0 indicating no IM. Due to the small number of children who were independently mobile,
scores were dichotomised into: (1) children with no IM; and (2) children with some IM (i.e. yes).
Overall, 71.8% of children had some form of IM (i.e. they were permitted to travel to at least one
activity/destination without an adult). During the school week surveyed, more boys had some IM
compared with girls (75.1% vs. 68.8% respectively, p , 0.01; Table 2).
Associations with independent mobility
 Table 3 shows the bivariate associations between IM and 26 objective environmental, social-cul-
tural and individual independent variables. Eligible items or scales (p = 0.1) were included in
further multivariate analyses given in Tables 4 and 5 (i.e. objective environmental items: boys
¼ 2, girls ¼ 2; perceived environmental items: boys ¼ 11, girls ¼ 7; social-cultural items:
boys ¼ 5, girls ¼ 5; individual items: boys ¼ 4, girls ¼ 5).
     Tables 4 and 5 show variables associated with boys’ and girls’ IM, respectively, in the multi-
variable models. After full adjustment, girls, but not boys’ IM was positively associated with
attending a school located in a walkable environment (girls OR 1.96, p ¼ 0.002; boys OR
0.98, p ¼ 0.950). Among girls and boys, both the child’s and their parents’ con<U+FB01>dence in the
child’s ability to walk to the closest shop without adult supervision, the child’s perception that
it was safe to play at the park closest to their house and that there were lots of children their
own age to hang out with locally increased the odds of being independently mobile. Higher
odds of IM were also found among boys whose parents perceived neighbourhood roads to be
safe. Girls who perceived that they often see people out on walks in their neighbourhood or

     Notably, however, after adjustment for social-cultural factors (model 3), associations between
IM and parental perceptions of living on a busy road (OR 0.65, p ¼ 0.152) attenuated and became
non-signi<U+FB01>cant among girls. Mediation analysis (Baron and Kenny 1986; Cerin and MacKinnon
2008) showed that the association between parental perceptions of living on a busy road and IM
(OR ¼ 0.54, p ¼ 0.026) was partially mediated by parents’ con<U+FB01>dence in their child’s ability to
walk to the closest shop without an adult (i.e. self-ef<U+FB01>cacy) (OR ¼ 0.62, p ¼ 0.100; Figure 2). In
other words, without adjustment for parent con<U+FB01>dence in their child’s ability to travel indepen-
dently, girls were 46% less likely (i.e. OR 0.54) to be IM if they lived on a busy road, but
with adjustment (for parent con<U+FB01>dence), girls were now 38% less likely to be independently
mobile (i.e. OR 0.62). Parents who reported that their home was located on a busy road were
half as likely to be con<U+FB01>dent in their child’s ability to travel without adult supervision. Overall
mediation of the model was signi<U+FB01>cant (Sobel test p ¼ 0.034). The proportion mediated was
0.352.
Discussion
Although ecological frameworks exploring children’s AT behaviour have begun to appear in the
literature (Timperio et al. 2004; McMillan 2005; Panter, Jones, and van Sluijs 2008), to date few
studies have investigated multiple levels of factors in<U+FB02>uencing IM (Fyhri and Hjorthol 2009; Page
et al. 2010). This study found that few children were independently mobile, but boys had more IM
than girls. However, a walkable neighbourhood characterised by well-connected, low traf<U+FB01>c
streets increased girls’ IM, but not boys. While in boys, positive parental perceptions about
safe neighbourhood road crossings enhanced their IM. Child and parent con<U+FB01>dence in the
child’s ability to travel independently was associated with IM in both boys and girls.
     In this study, 71.8% of children had some form of IM (i.e. they were permitted to travel to at
least one activity/destination without an adult), however; the majority of these children travelled
to only a few destinations independently. The proportion of children with IM in this study is
higher than that reported in studies conducted elsewhere. For example, in the UK just over one
half of children aged 8 – 11 years were allowed outside without an adult (Mackett et al. 2007),
while in New Zealand, 44.3% of children aged 6 – 11 years travelled independently (Mitchell,
Kearns, and Collins 2007) and in Sweden, 30% of children aged 8 – 11 years travelled indepen-
dently to leisure activities (Johansson 2006). Although the number of destinations travelled to

                                                                   Children’s Geographies         405
independently was not included in the IM measure in other studies, differences in IM rates
between studies may be attributed to differences in age groups, data collection methods, and
wording of questions, making direct comparisons between countries dif<U+FB01>cult. For example, the
UK study (Mackett et al. 2007) included only two schools and used travel diaries to measure
whether children travelled independently to each destination. The Swedish study (Johansson
2006) also used travel diaries, whereas the New Zealand study (Mitchell, Kearns, and Collins
2007) was qualitative and explored independent journeys to school only.
     There were some differences in correlates of IM by sex. Consistent with previous AT studies
(Boarnet et al. 2005; Kerr et al. 2006; Zhu and Lee 2008), neighbourhood walkability measured
by street connectivity and exposure to traf<U+FB01>c was associated with children’s IM, but in girls only.
However, parental concern about the safety of neighbourhood road crossings was associated with
boys’ IM, but not girls. Other studies also suggest that real and perceived traf<U+FB01>c issues, such as
traf<U+FB01>c volume, speed, lack of safe crossings, and presence of visual obstructions on the roads (e.g.
parked cars on the road) are important correlates of children’s mobility and affect whether parents
allow their child to walk or cycle (Gielen et al. 2004; Timperio et al. 2004; Mitchell, Kearns, and
Collins 2007; McMillan 2007; Jago et al. 2009).
     Conversely, well-connected street networks facilitates AT behaviour (Braza, Shoemaker, and
Seeley 2004; Boarnet et al. 2005; Kerr et al. 2006; Falb et al. 2007; Mota et al. 2007; Bejleri et al.
2009; Giles-Corti et al. 2011). Connected streets increase proximity to local destinations, provid-
ing shorter and usually more direct routes to destinations. This enables children to easily navigate
their neighbourhood, which may encourage parents to allow their children to travel indepen-
dently. However, street connectivity appeared to be important for encouraging girls’ IM only.
It may be that provided the streets are safe in terms of traf<U+FB01>c, boys and their parents are less con-
cerned about whether the streets are highly connected. Rather, stronger more proximal factors
appeared to in<U+FB02>uence boy’s mobility (e.g. con<U+FB01>dence in ability to travel independently).
     Several factors may contribute to the sex differences observed. Consistent with previous
studies (O’Brien et al. 2000; Mackett et al. 2007; Page et al. 2009), more boys than girls were
independently mobile. Moreover, boys generally have a larger territorial range (Webley 1981;
van Vliet 1983; Matthews 1987) travel independently more frequently (Mackett et al. 2007),
and are allowed to do more local activities and errands (Mackett et al. 2007). Thus parent percep-
tions about safe neighbourhood road crossings, for example, may be important because boys are
more exposed to their neighbourhood environment. Nevertheless, because boys have more
experience in being IM, it appears that parents may feel they are more capable than girls in nego-
tiating traf<U+FB01>c conditions, and being spatially aware of their surroundings. Thus, they have more
con<U+FB01>dence in their son’s abilities to traverse their neighbourhood. Subsequently, these views may
also affect parental decisions to grant boys more independence. On the other hand, parental
control over girls IM may be more rigid, most likely due to safety concerns.
     Indeed, McMillan (2005) has proposed a conceptual framework that identi<U+FB01>es parental
decision-making as a mediator of the relationship between the built environment and travel be-
haviour in children (McMillan 2005). Parents determine whether or not their child travels inde-
pendently. In the current study, the parent’s (and child’s) con<U+FB01>dence in the child’s ability to walk
or cycle without adult supervision emerged as a strong factor in<U+FB02>uencing increased independent
movement in both girls and boys. For example, this con<U+FB01>dence appeared to partially mediate the
relationship between parent perceptions of living on a busy road and their daughter’s IM. Notably,
parents of girls who lived on busy streets were half as likely to be con<U+FB01>dent in their daughter’s
ability to travel independently, possibly due to perceived dangers associated with high traf<U+FB01>c
exposure. It may be that girls are less experienced negotiating local traf<U+FB01>c compared with
boys, in part due to having less opportunity to be independently mobile. This <U+FB01>nding suggests
that the built environment may in<U+FB02>uence parents’ perceptions about the neighbourhood

406       K. Villanueva et al.
environment which in turn affects whether or not they were con<U+FB01>dent enough to allow their chil-
dren independence.
     There were some similarities among boys and girls. It is noteworthy that there was no associ-
ation between IM and parental fear of their child’s safety (i.e. stranger danger, bullying and per-
sonal injury). Studies have found that parental concerns about strangers (e.g. abductions,
kidnappings and murders) and crime can restrict their child’s travel behaviour (Pooley, Turnbull,
and Adams 2005; Mitchell, Kearns, and Collins 2007) and independent physical activity (Jago
et al. 2009), although there are mixed age-dependent <U+FB01>ndings (Jago et al. 2009) and others
have also found no sex differences (Johansson 2003). Notably, most parents – irrespective of
whether or not they allowed their child independence – reported being concerned about strangers
and their children’s safety (90.1%). Thus, this factor did not discriminate between children who
were or were not independently mobile. Children themselves may also fear for their safety (Mitch-
ell, Kearns, and Collins 2007). This is re<U+FB02>ected in our current <U+FB01>ndings showing that boys’ and
girls’ IM was related to whether they perceived the park closest to their house to be safe and
their perceptions of children their own age present in their neighbourhood. For children travelling
to parks and other destinations, children have expressed concerns about strangers, and the pres-
ence of older children and gangs (Nayak 2003; Jago et al. 2009). Children’s perceptions of people
walking and cycling and interactions with neighbours and friends is associated with increases in
children’s outdoor activity in previous studies (Timperio et al. 2004; Evenson et al. 2007; Carver,
Timperio, and Crawford 2008; Page et al. 2010). The presence of young children and adults could
increase actual and perceived surveillance which may contribute to a sense of safety (Valentine
1997), feelings of trust and mutual support.
     Conversely, children with more IM (e.g. boys) have more exposure to the local environment
as they are granted more freedom to move. Therefore, it is plausible that because independently
mobile children are more exposed to their neighbourhood surroundings, they are able to enjoy
the bene<U+FB01>ts of IM. Indeed, previous research suggests that IM can enhance children’s self-
esteem, develop their cognitive skills (e.g. problem-solving, dealing with risk and initiative),
provide opportunities to cope with responsibility, develop social skills through interacting
with others, and develop spatial and way-<U+FB01>nding skills to manipulate traf<U+FB01>c situations (Joshi,
MacClean, and Carter 1999; Rissotto and Tonucci 2002; Prezza and Pacilli 2007). The presence
of children in the neighbourhood may also facilitate social capital, a sense of community, and
the development of local friendships (Tranter and Whitelegg 1994), suggesting wider commu-
nity bene<U+FB01>ts. However, as this is a cross-sectional study, causal associations cannot be
determined.
     The study <U+FB01>ndings have important implications for policy and practice. Designing safe, ‘walk-
able’ neighbourhoods appears to be an important pre-condition for children to be independently
mobile. Streets surrounding destinations should be both highly connected to minimise distances
between home and local destinations, yet carry lower levels of traf<U+FB01>c. This may involve creating
avenues or boulevards that separate children, pedestrians and cyclists away from cars. This would
not only create a safer neighbourhood environment for children, but would also increase parent
and child’s con<U+FB01>dence in children being independently mobile. Although not implemented in
Perth, US Programmes such as ‘Safe routes to school’ (Boarnet et al. 2005) have had some
success in altering the built environment to provide a safer travel environment for children.
However, greater attention should be given to creating safe routes to all local destinations fre-
quented by children (such as shops, sporting facilities and parks), not just to schools (Giles-
Corti et al. 2009). These results suggest that appealing yet safe routes and places for children
are essential in shaping parental and child feelings of safety and con<U+FB01>dence.
     Despite attempts to address some of the built environment barriers, parents may still be reluc-
tant to allow their children to travel independently. Given that Perth is a highly car-dependent city,

                                                                     Children’s Geographies       407
with a high proportion of parents ((60% in 1997 (Carlin et al. 1997); 71% in 2008 (Martin
et al. 2009)) ‘chauffeuring’ their children to school and other destinations, there is considerable
scope to change social norms, and encourage parents to allow their children to walk or cycle. It
may be that parents drive their children to protect them from adverse traf<U+FB01>c conditions yet this
creates a major source of traf<U+FB01>c safety problems for children who do walk or cycle (Tranter
and Pawson 2001). There appears to be a need to not only create safer environments, but also
to educate parents, children, schools and the community of the multiple bene<U+FB01>ts of IM. For
example, as outlined earlier, promoting IM offers the potential to increase community physical
activity levels and provides extensive bene<U+FB01>ts, not only for the child, but for their parents, and
the wider community (Prezza et al. 2001). In fact, Jago et al. (2009) suggested that interventions
and campaigns to promote IM and approaches to manage parental concerns are required. In
Western Australia, there are currently no programmes that target IM per se. Designing interven-
tions to promote children’s IM is complex, and may involve numerous strategies and the
cooperation of multiple players. For example, a focus on skill development could be integrated
in future campaigns, thereby increasing the child’s competence and con<U+FB01>dence (and their
parents) to be independently mobile. Bicycle education classes, neighbourhood watch pro-
grammes, walking school bus programmes and school travel plans are all examples of pro-
grammes that may contribute to building con<U+FB01>dence in a child’s ability to spatially navigate
their area safely through skill-building and awareness through doing. Currently, bicycle education
classes are not part of the curriculum in WA primary schools (Trapp et al. 2011). There may be
potential to improve children’s cycling ability through programmes that combine theoretical
knowledge (e.g. road rules, wearing helmets and bicycle maintenance), with practical skills
classes (e.g. concentration and attention to surroundings, judging speed, decision-making and
con<U+FB01>dence) (Briem et al. 2004). Although the walking school bus program is not targeted speci<U+FB01>-
cally at IM, it provides children with skills to increase con<U+FB01>dence in their ability to walk or cycle
by identifying safe practices and negotiating traf<U+FB01>c situations. Moreover, to facilitate a sense of
neighbourhood safety and surveillance, there is potential bene<U+FB01>t of promoting AT in different
populations and age groups; efforts should be made to create child-friendly streets and places
by encouraging parents, children and neighbours to be active in their neighbourhood, thereby pro-
viding environments conducive for independent travel. This study highlights the need to involve
managing parental and child concerns by creating safe routes and destinations through improve-
ments to connectivity, walking and cycling infrastructure, protection from traf<U+FB01>c, as well as child
and parent education.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. Although based on a large sample, the generalisability of the
results is limited to children aged 10– 12 years attending government primary schools in high and
low walkable neighbourhoods. Moreover, the SWI used was a composite of street connectivity
and road traf<U+FB01>c volume exposure only. Other aspects of the built environment, such as destination
or land use mix may be important. Zhu and Lee (2008), for example, incorporated a measure of
pedestrian facilities, residential density, land use mix and street connectivity into their neighbour-
hood walkability index for children. Moreover, the walkability of the school neighbourhood was
used as a proxy for neighbourhood walkability. This may have introduced measurement error,
particularly for those living on the edge of the school neighbourhood. A walkability measure
speci<U+FB01>c to the child’s home would be a more accurate measure, especially for children travelling
to destinations other than school. Furthermore, other broader factors may in<U+FB02>uence IM (e.g. eth-
nicity, hours of daylight, weather conditions and parental restrictions), however these were not
explored here. It is important to note that the level of IM for children was low although it was

408         K. Villanueva et al.
higher in comparison to other studies. Moreover, this was a cross-sectional study, therefore caus-
ality cannot be assumed.
Conclusion
As children age and are given more independence, neighbourhood design may impact on whether
children are able, or allowed to walk or cycle. A walkable and child-friendly neighbourhood is
necessary, albeit insuf<U+FB01>cient for supporting IM. Although the built environment plays an impor-
tant role in shaping parents’ and child perceptions and con<U+FB01>dence in whether or not they feel safe,
to foster IM, a multilevel integrated approach (involving children, parents, schools, the commu-
nity, and organisations involved in safety and designing neighbourhoods) to interventions should
be adopted. Providing safe, walkable neighbourhoods – particularly for girls – combined with
strategies to increase children’s skills to safely navigate their neighbourhood may be required
to increase both girls’ and boys’ independent mobility by helping manage parental safety con-
cerns and increasing parental and child con<U+FB01>dence in children’s independent travel abilities.
