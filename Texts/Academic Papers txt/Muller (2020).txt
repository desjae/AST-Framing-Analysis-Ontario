    The MNL model (12) exhibits the property known as independence
from irrelevant alternatives (IIA), which states that every alternative j is
an equal substitute to i. Technically speaking, by using the MNL we
assume there is no correlation between the alternative modes, although
we can easily find situations that violate this assumption. For instance,
the alternatives “walk” and “bike” might both be sensitive to the
weather and therefore share some unobserved effects, which could in
turn cause correlations between “walk” and “bike” that are neglected
by the MNL. We use the McFadden omitted variables test to verify
whether the IIA assumption holds or not. If the assumption does not
hold, we must make different assumptions about the distribution of <U+03F5>ni.
Here we assume <U+03F5>ni to be a multivariate extreme value distribution.
Thus from (11) we obtain the nested logit model (NL):

where (13) is the choice probability of alternative i in nest Bt. We
partition the choice set into S nonoverlapping subsets denoted B1, B2,
…, BS and call them nests from hereon. The parameter µs is a measure of
the degree of independence in unobserved utility among the alter-
natives in nest s. Scale parameter µ is normalized to 1. The NL exhibits
the following properties:
 1. For any two alternatives that are in the same nest, the ratio of
    probabilities is independent of the attributes or existence of all other
    alternatives. That is, the IIA property holds within each nest.
 2. For any two alternatives in different nests, the ratio of probabilities
    can depend on the attributes of other alternatives in the two nests.
    IIA does not hold in general for alternatives in different nests.
    The assignment of alternatives to nests is arbitrary. We test the nest
specifications shown in Fig. 5. We understand that walk and bike may
have unobservable sources of correlation (as AST modes) and we
therefore test different alternatives to improve the model. We also test
whether car and public transport (PuTr) – as non-active transportation
–, and the environmentally friendly choice of PuTr, bike and walking,
share unobserved characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the models tested in this
study.
