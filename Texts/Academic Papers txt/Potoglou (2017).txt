    The analysis was based on data for 4206 primary school children     Active travel to school;
    (4–12 years of age) and 3203 adolescents (12–19 years of age)       primary school; high school;
    collected as part of the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 waves of the       walking; youth; UK
    National Survey for Wales. Logistic regression estimates showed
    that living within less than one mile from the school, parents’
    frequency of walking and cycling and residing in an urban area
    were positively associated with active travel to both primary and
    secondary schools. Children’s age, mother’s unavailability and
    home ownership were negatively associated with active travel to
    primary school. Gender differences were only identified in the
    secondary school trips with female adolescents being less likely to
    walk to school than males. Findings point to the importance of
    ‘beyond-the-school’ active-travel campaigns and intervention
    programmes aimed at involving parents in encouraging walking
    and cycling to school.
1. Introduction and background
In 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that 170 million children (10%)
under the age of 18 years were estimated to be overweight or obese worldwide (Lobstein,
Baur, and Uauy 2004, cited in; World Health Organisation 2012). Obesity has been associ-
ated with a number of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and different
types of cancer (American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research
Fund 2007; Buttitta et al. 2013; Laverty et al. 2013; Ottova et al. 2011). In addition, over-
weight children may also incur psychological problems negatively affecting their quality of
their life; for example, due to teasing, lower self-esteem or discrimination (Black et al.
2014; Ottova et al. 2011; Riazi et al. 2010; Wille et al. 2010).
    Since the 1970s, the number of overweight children has been increasing across many
countries (World Obesity Federation 2014). In the United Kingdom (UK), the highest
level of childhood obesity is found in Wales where in 2012, 15% of children were over-
weight and 19% were obese, respectively (Public Health England 2015; Welsh Government
2015d). Recent projections estimate that the proportion of obese children in Wales could
reach 25% by 2050, if no action is taken (Welsh Government 2015d).

   There is evidence that active travel can reduce the risk of being overweight and its
associated health consequences (Laverty et al. 2013). One of the initiatives to tackle child-
hood obesity is by promoting active travel (walking and cycling) to school (World Health
Organisation 2012). Such initiatives also arise as a response to a dramatic decline of active
travel to school and a substantial increase of commuting children by car across many
countries. In Wales, for example, during the period 1971–2011, the use of private
motorised transport for commuting to work has doubled, whereas walking decreased by
almost half and cycling remained constant at only about 2% (Goodman 2013). Such
trends may be explained by the remarkable increase of car ownership in the country;
for example, UK Department for Transport data show that car ownership increased by
43% between 1994 (1.006 million cars) and 2011 (1.437 million cars) (Department for
Transport 2013). Understanding which factors are associated with active travel to
school may help to identify interventions to promote active travel to school.
   A large body of evidence documented in a series of literature- (e.g. Panter, Jones, and
van Sluijs 2008; Sirard et al. 2005) and systematic-reviews (e.g. Brunton et al. 2003; Faul-
kner et al. 2009) shows that empirical studies offer a wide array of findings, which either
cannot be generalised or are inconsistent. Given the size of evidence and to save space, we
present key findings of a selection of the most recent studies on active travel to school in
Appendix 1. Inconsistencies across studies may be due to study design limitations includ-
ing availability of recent or directly relevant survey data to study active travel (e.g. Mitra
and Buliung 2015), measurement bias and cross-country variations (McDonald et al.
2011). Finally, the majority of the studies concentrate on the United States (US) and
only recently studies contrast differences between primary and secondary school children
(Mitra and Buliung 2015).
   Differences may also exist because of different variable specifications. For example,
among physical environmental factors (see Appendix 1), distance has been the key deter-
minant of active travel to school across all studies. However, differences are observed in
the specification of what may be an acceptable distance to encourage walking or cycling
to school. For example, in a recent analysis of Scottish data, Waygood and Susilo
(2015) reported that children were more likely to walk or cycle if they lived within
0.78 km (0.5 miles) from their school. On the other hand, van Goeverden and de Boer’s
(2013) study in Flanders (Belgium) and the Netherlands considered a ‘cut-off’ point of
3 km for cycling, whereas for walking D’Haese et al. (2011) and Christiansen et al.
(2014) defined ‘cut-off’ points at 1.5 km in Belgium (c. 1 mile) and 4 km in Denmark,
respectively.
   Some studies find an association between active travel to school and the factors listed in
Appendix 1 and others do not. Moreover, physical and environmental variables may be
captured in different ways – for example, parent perceptions vs. physical measures. For
example, parents’ road safety perceptions in some studies were significantly associated
with active travel to primary and secondary schools across a number of US cities
(Carlson et al. 2014; Chillón et al. 2014) whereas Babey et al. (2009) reported that
parents’ road safety perception was not associated with travel to secondary school in Cali-
fornia. Babey et al. (2009), Jensen (2008), Waygood et al. (2015), Chriqui et al. (2012) and
Buliung et al. (2011) reported significant associations between active travel and objective
measures of road safety and related physical and non-physical interventions including safe
routes to school, school travel plans and walking school buses.

82       D. POTOGLOU AND B. ARSLANGULOVA
   Hypotheses related to physical and environmental factors also vary according to data
availability and the geographic scale of analysis. For example, national- or state/region-
level analyses find significant associations between active travel to primary and secondary
schools and the level of urbanisation, namely urban, suburban vs. rural/not urbanised (e.g.
Babey et al. 2009; van Goeverden and de Boer 2013). Other studies are based on measures
of land-use mix – for example, the mix of employment and population (Mitra, Buliung,
and Faulkner 2010) or parents’ perceptions regarding adequate walking and cycling infra-
structure (Panter et al. 2010b; Susilo and Liu 2015; Waygood and Susilo 2015). Finally,
Waygood and Susilo (2015) found that living with ‘friendly people in the neighbourhood’
was not associated with active travel to primary school in Scotland. However, other forms
of social capital such as social control have been associated with active travel to school.
McDonald, Deakin, and Aalborg (2010), for example, found that children whose
parents reported high levels of social control were more likely to walk or cycle to
school. The study was based on a sample of 357 parents residing in the San Francisco
Bay Area between 2006 and 2007.
   Studies also report on a number of adjustment variables related to child and parent/
household characteristics. Child-related variables typically include age and gender and
both involve mixed findings. A number of studies indicate that age is a significant
factor associated with travel to school – that is, children aged 5–10 years are less likely
to walk to school primarily due to safety concerns (e.g. Chillón et al. 2010; DiGuiseppi
et al. 1998; Mitra and Buliung 2014). Evidence from a longitudinal analysis of 7690
school-aged children in Canada showed that as children’s age increased the likelihood
of walking or cycling to school also increased, but it peaked at the age of 10 years and
then declined (Pabayo, Gauvin, and Barnett 2011). Susilo and Waygood (2012) also
reported that 10–14-year-olds in Japan were less likely to be chauffeured on a given day
(including school trips) when compared with their 5–9-year-old counterparts. However,
10–14-year-olds were more likely to participate in a higher number of car trips relative
to 15–19-year-olds. By contrast, evidence from Australia showed that pupils aged 11–12
years were equally less likely to walk when compared to pupils aged 5–6 years (Timperio
et al. 2006).
   Gender has also been reported as an important factor to be taken into consideration
both for children and adolescents, especially for the design of interventions (Panter
et al. 2011). In many cases, there are slight or insignificant differences between boys
and girls when travelling to primary school (McDonald et al. 2011; Mitra and Buliung
2015), whereas male adolescents are more likely to walk or cycle than female adolescents
(Babey et al. 2009; Emond and Handy 2012). Interestingly, Susilo and Waygood (2012)
found that girls in Japan were less likely to be chauffeured by car for their daily trips com-
pared with boys.
   Inconsistent results with regard to household characteristics such as, family income,
parental education and employment and parental use of active-travel modes are probably
due to differences across countries. de Vries et al. (2010) reported that the results of studies
conducted in the US frequently differ from those conducted in Europe. Also, Panter et al.
(2010a) argued that the results from studies conducted in the US can be different than
those in Australia. An example is the relationship between income and active travel to
school. McDonald et al. (2011) found that American pupils of households earning over
$100,000 per year were more likely to walk or cycle to school than those whose parents

                                             TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY        83
earned less than $30,000 per year. In the Scottish study by Waygood and Susilo (2015)
income was not significantly associated with active travel and was not retained in the
final models. On the other hand, Silva et al. (2011) found that children in high-income
households in Brazil were less likely to walk or cycle to school. In the absence of
income data, some studies have used housing tenure (e.g. owner occupied, rented and
social housing) as a measure of socio-economic status. For example, DiGuiseppi et al.
(1998) reported that children living in owner-occupied accommodation in Camden and
Islington, London, were twice as likely to travel to school by car than children living in
rented or housing-association accommodation. Finally, there has been little evidence on
how parents’ own use of active-travel modes may be associated with children and adoles-
cent active travel and active travel to school, in particular.
    Given variations on how different factors are measured, differences in findings and lack
of evidence in the some cases, it is important to report findings from other countries,
especially those with high prevalence of overweight and obesity. Therefore, the primary
contribution of this paper is that it reports evidence on active travel to school in Wales,
a country with very high childhood obesity rates using nationally representative data. In
particular, the study examines how travel behaviour of Welsh primary school children
and adolescents is associated with physical/environmental factors, child and parent
characteristics. The study also contrasts differences between primary school children
and adolescents as some case studies in the US and Canada have highlighted differences
when children enter secondary school (McDonald 2006; Mitra and Buliung 2015).
2. Data
Data from the National Survey for Wales (NSW) for 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 were used
in this study (Welsh Government 2015b, 2015c). The NSW is a repeated cross-sectional
survey based on probability sample design, which has been conducted between 2012
and 2015. The NSW is a key source of information for the Welsh Government on the
views and circumstances of people in Wales. Each year, approximately 14,500 individuals
over the age of 16 years are surveyed using face-to-face interviews; topics and related ques-
tions include education, health and transport (Welsh Government 2014, 2015c).
    The 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 waves are the only ones to include data on travel to
primary (4–12 years of age) and secondary (12–19 years of age) schools over the previous
year from the day the survey was conducted. It is therefore worth highlighting that the
survey data include the child’s age at the time of the survey hence the age of secondary
school children may in some cases exceed the 18 years of age and the age of some
primary school children may be 13 years. Also, because the mode choice question was for-
mulated as ‘usual mode’ over the past 12 months’, a child in the age of 11/12 years would
have answered questions about travel to both primary and secondary schools, again
depending on the time survey was conducted.
3. Explanatory factors and statistical analysis
The explanatory factors in this study were classified into: (1) moderating (child/adolescent
age and gender), (2) physical/environmental factors, (3) parent/guardian and household
characteristics and (4) other factors, namely the quarter and year of the data collection.

84        D. POTOGLOU AND B. ARSLANGULOVA
The above variable classification was guided by data availability and findings from the lit-
erature review in Appendix 1. The selection of variables was also informed by Panter,
Jones, and van Sluijs’s (2008) theoretical framework on active travel to school, which
was developed through an extensive review of findings across the subject areas of trans-
port, planning and promotion of health and physical activity.
    Among the physical and environmental factors considered was distance to school,
which was defined by three intervals: (a) less than 0.78 km (0.5 miles); (b) 0.78–1.6 km
(0.5–1 mile) and (c) greater than 1.6 km (1 mile). The selected distance intervals were
in line with the categories introduced in the NSW questionnaire and were measured
according to the parents’ perception of the average distance between their home and
the school. We also grouped children and adolescents into two groups based on
whether they lived in rural Wales (vs. urban and suburban). Parent (guardian) perceptions
about the local area were captured by two five-point Likert-scale questions: (a) ‘belonging
to local area’ and (b) ‘people treating each other with respect’. Parent (or guardian) and
household characteristics included the number of children and whether the household
sought support for problems with debt in the previous 12 months. We also included
factors related to mothers’ (or female guardians’) availability – by creating the dummy
variable ‘mother in full-time employment’, parent (or guardian) education level
(‘highest education qualification)’ and whether ‘parents had a limiting long-standing
illness, disability or infirmity’. Family culture towards walking and cycling was captured
by the frequency of parents’ walking and cycling per week introduced as (a) cycling
and (b) walking at least 1–2 times week, respectively. Finally, the housing tenure variable
classified children and adolescents into three groups: (a) living in owner-occupied home,
(b) social housing and (c) rented accommodation.
    Logistic regression modelling examined the association between active travel to
primary and secondary schools and the above mentioned physical/environmental,
parent/guardian and household characteristics. The analysis was conducted within the
Complex Samples Add-On Module on IBM SPSS Statistics 23. The Complex Samples
Module was used to take into account the survey design and produce confidence intervals
for the survey data (Welsh Government 2015a). Considering the cross-sectional nature of
the samples we introduced dummy variables to capture potential differences across survey
waves and the year of the survey (2013/2014 or 2014/2015). Preliminary analyses were
based on estimating separate logistic regression models for each of the explanatory
factors while each run controlled for the age and gender of the child and adolescent in
the primary and secondary school samples, respectively.
4. Results
4.1. Exploratory analysis
Table 1 the characteristics of the children, adolescents, primary respondents and house-
hold in the sample. As shown in Table 1, there were 4206 primary school children and
3203 adolescents in the combined sample of the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 waves of the
NSW, respectively. The majority of respondents lived in urban areas in owner-occupied
accommodation. Most parents stated that they were working and more than a third
had higher education qualification in both the primary and secondary school samples.

In terms of active travel, although most parents did not cycle (92.7% in the primary and
94.2% in the secondary school samples) half of the parents stated that they walked several
times per week or every day.
     The dependent variable was the choice between active (walking and cycling) and non-
active travel modes to school on a typical day. Active-travel was defined as parents’ (or
guardians’) indication that the usual mode to/from school was solely walking or cycling
whereas non-active travel included car, public transport as well as combinations of
active and non-active travel modes such as car and walking or bus and walking.
Overall, as shown in Table 1, 36.2% of children and 25.8% of adolescents solely walked
or cycled to primary and secondary schools, respectively. Out of the 63.8% of primary
school children who used non-active travel modes to/from school, 13.7% of those reported
using a combination of non-active or active and non-active modes (e.g. car and bus; car

86       D. POTOGLOU AND B. ARSLANGULOVA
and walk). In the case of adolescents, 74.2% of the sample travelled by non-active travel
modes with 7.9% of that proportion who used a combination of non-active or non-
active- and active-travel modes.
   Figure 1 shows the percentage of active commuting to primary and secondary schools
by unitary authority, an administrative unit for local government in Wales. Between 42%
and 52% of children in the areas of Cardiff, Newport, Caerphilly, Conwy, Flintshire and
Wrexham walked or cycled to primary school. The proportion of children across
Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, Torfaen, Vale of Glamorgan and Cynon who actively
commuted to primary school ranged between 33% and 41%. Twenty (20%) to 32% of
children cycled or walked to primary school across Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot,
Swansea, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire Rhondda, Merthyr Tydfil, Powys,
Gwynedd, Isle of Anglesey and in Denbighshire. Finally, in Ceredigion less than 20%
of children walked or cycled to primary school. As also shown in Figure 1, the highest
percentage of children who cycled and walked to secondary schools was found in
Cardiff (44.7%) and the second highest proportion was in the Vale of Glamorgan
(33.6%). For a large number of unitary authorities, active travel to secondary school
ranged between 20% and 32%, namely across the areas of Newport, Torfaen, Mon-
mouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Cynon, Bridgend, Swansea, Pembrokeshire,
Gwynedd, Conwy, Isle of Anglesey, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Finally,
less than 20% of children walked or cycled to school in Neath Port Talbot, Carmarthen-
shire Rhondda, Powys, Merthyr Tydfil and Ceredigion.

4.2. Factors associated with active-travel to school in Wales
Table 2 presents results from separate logistic regression models one for each explanatory
factor (e.g. distance to school) and each time controlling for child/adolescent age and
gender in both the primary and secondary school samples (nb: age and gender coefficients
are not reported in Table 2).
4.2.1. Physical/environmental factors
Shorter (self-reported) distance to primary and secondary schools was positively associ-
ated with active travel to school. Children and adolescents who lived under 0.5 miles
(0.78 km) or between 0.5 and 1 mile (0.78–1.6 km) from the school were more likely to
walk or cycle to/from school than those living farther than 1 mile (1.6 km).
    Also, children and adolescents who lived in rural areas were less likely to walk or cycle
to school. On the other hand, parents’ perceptions of ‘belonging to local area’ and ‘feeling
that people treat each other with respect’ were not significantly associated with active
travel to/from school.

4.2.2. Parent/guardian and household characteristics
Children and adolescents who had siblings were more likely to walk or cycle to school. This
effect was captured through the ‘number of children’ variable. Children in families that
either experienced financial problems or their parent/guardian had a limiting long-standing
illness, disability or infirmity were more likely to walk to/from the primary school.
However, these two variables (financial problems and ill health or disability of parent/guar-
dian) were not significantly associated with adolescents’ active-travel to secondary school.
Also, a child’s mother (or female guardian) employed full-time reduced the child’s likeli-
hood to walk or cycle to school. Both children and adolescents were more likely to walk
or cycle to school if their parents walked or cycled at least 1–2 times per week. Finally,
housing tenure was only significantly associated with active travel to primary school, but
not for travel to secondary school. In particular, primary school children in owner-occupied
homes were less likely to walk or cycle to school than those living in private rented accom-
modation. On the other hand, the likelihood of walking or cycling to primary school
increased if pupils lived in social-housing accommodation.
4.2.3. Other factors
With regard to season and survey-year variations, we found that primary school children
surveyed in the periods between July–September and October–December were more
likely to walk or cycle relative to those children surveyed in the period between
January and March (reference category), but these effects were only significant at the
90% level of confidence. On the other hand, secondary school children were less
likely to walk to school if they were surveyed between October and December. A margin-
ally significant difference was found between the two survey years; children surveyed
during the year 2013/2014 were more likely to walk or cycle than those surveyed in
2014/2015 (reference category).
4.3. Active travel to school: combined-factor models
Table 3 shows associations of combined-factor models for active travel to primary and sec-
ondary schools. Variable and model specifications in the combined-factor models took
into account the estimation results in Table 2 and any insignificant effects detected in
the initial combined-factor-model runs. With regard to the child’s age, we found signifi-
cant effects across age groups in the primary school samples; children of younger age (4–6
and 7–9 years of age) were less likely to walk or cycle to school when compared with chil-
dren between 10 and 12 years of age. No significant associations across age groups were
detected in the secondary school sample. Also, differences between male and female ado-
lescents’ active travel to school remained in the combined model.
    The distance to school, level of urbanisation (rural vs. urban), number of children,
parents’ weekly walk and cycling frequencies remained significantly associated with
active travel to both primary and secondary schools. On the other hand, significant associ-
ations observed in the univariate models (which were only adjusted for age and gender, see
Table 2) such as households who sought support due to financial problems and a parent
with higher education qualification (e.g. university degree) were no longer significant in
the combined-factor models. Also, children living in owner-occupied homes were less
likely to walk or cycle to primary school than those in social housing and private

September (vs. January–March) and in the period 2013/2014 (vs. 2014/2015) who were
more likely to walk or cycle to school. By contrast, adolescents surveyed in the period
October–December were less likely to walk or cycle to secondary school.
5. Discussion
This paper examined potential associations of active travel to primary and secondary
schools on an average (typical) day in Wales against physical/environmental factors,
child/adolescent and parent characteristics.
    The key finding of the analyses in this study was that parents’ frequency of walking and
cycling was positively associated with both child and adolescent active travel (walking and

90        D. POTOGLOU AND B. ARSLANGULOVA
cycling) to school. This hypothesis has not been frequently tested in the literature but does
offer the evidence base to support recent calls advocating the importance of raising parents’
awareness to reduce ‘child-miles’ travelled for school trips (Modeshift 2010). When parents
cycled at least 1–2 times per week, the likelihood of their children and adolescents walking or
cycling to primary and secondary schools doubled (OR = exp(ß)). Also, if parents walked at
least 1–2 times per week, the likelihood of active travel to school for primary school children
and adolescents increased by 1.6 and 1.8 times, respectively. The results agree with findings
reported by McMillan et al. (2006) in the US who also found that the longer parents spend
walking the higher the likelihood of their children is to walk or cycle to school. The devel-
opment of this hypothesis was guided by previous evidence on ‘active caregivers-active
youth’ discussed in activity research; McMillan et al. (2006), however, stressed that the
hypothesis has not always been proven. More broadly, such hypothesis may be supported
by theories such as Social Learning Theory (Bandura 1971), which postulates that learning
is based on observation, retention, reproduction and motivation.
    Given that the evidence in the international literature varies across countries, this study
offers evidence on how far children and adolescents are prepared to walk or cycle to school
in Wales. In particular, perceived distances shorter than 1 mile (c. 1.6 km) between home
and school were significantly associated with active travel in both children (4–12 years of
age) and adolescents (13–19 years of age). The odds-ratio for primary school children
living within 0.5 miles (0.78 km) from their school was 3.7 times (OR = ß; for a three-
level dummy coded variable) and those living between 0.5 and 1 mile (0.78–1.6 km) the
corresponding odds-ratio was 2.3 times more likely to walk or cycle relative to those
living over 1 mile. Also, the corresponding odds-ratio for adolescents was 4.5 times
more likely to walk or cycle if they lived within 0.5 miles from their school and 3 times
if they lived between 0.5 and 1 mile. Waygood and Susilo (2015) also showed that if
10–11-year-olds in Scotland lived shorter than 0.5 miles (0.78 km) from their school
they were more likely to walk to school. In a study on children and adolescent travel to
school in Toronto, Canada, Mitra and Buliung (2015) reported a distance tolerance
between home and school at 400 m; the authors also reported that children and adoles-
cents living farther than 1.6 km (1 mile) were less likely to walk to school. With regard
to cycling trips, the study by Godefroy and Morency (2012) on the Island of Montreal,
Canada, reported distance thresholds for cycling at 1.99 km for boys and 1.27 km for
girls aged 5–12 years. The distance thresholds for cycling in adolescents were estimated
at 3.56 km for males and 2.95 km for females. Finally, the study by van Goeverden and
de Boer (2013) in Flanders (Belgium) and Netherlands also found significant associations
between distance and walking to school but they set the walking distance tolerance at
3 km. These findings suggest that the distance tolerance, primarily for walking, of
Welsh children and adolescents was closer to children and adolescents in Scotland and
North America than Flanders and the Netherlands.
    ‘Living in rural Wales’ was negatively associated with active travel to both primary and
secondary schools. Children and adolescents were more likely to actively commute to
school if they lived in an urban area relative to a rural area, which was consistent with find-
ings by Panter et al. (2010a) who also suggested that urbanisation was positively associated
with active commuting. Another reason could be that parents living in urbanised areas
tend to use their car less than parents living in rural areas (Ewing and Cervero 2010;
Sun et al. 2009; Susilo and Maat 2007).

   In terms of children’s age, 4–9-year-olds were more likely to actively travel to school
relative to older children in the primary school. This finding is in line with the studies
by Susilo and Waygood (2012) in the City of Osaka, Japan, and Pabayo, Gauvin, and
Barnett (2011) in Canada who also suggested that the likelihood of walking to primary
school increased with age but reached a peak at the age of 10–12 years. The active
travel to school of adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years of age was no different
than those of 17 years of age and older. This finding is in line with Timperio et al.’s
(2006) study in Australia who also found that active travel to school was independent
from the children’s age. These findings were against evidence from the US where
younger children were less likely to actively commute to school (Deka 2013).
   With regard to gender and active travel to school, findings in the primary school sample
were in line with D’Haese et al. (2011) and Pojani and Boussauw (2014), who did not find
any significant association with active travel to school. Our findings are also consistent
with other ‘four-nations’ results such as Waygood and Susilo (2015) who did not find
any gender differences and did not retain that variable in their final model. In the second-
ary school sample, findings agreed with Babey et al. (2009), Mitra and Buliung (2015) and
Emond and Handy (2012) who also reported that male adolescents were more likely to
actively travel to school.
   Mother’s employment status was classified as ‘in employment’ and ‘not in employment’
and was interacted with primary respondent (parent/guardian) being female. This inter-
action tested whether the female guardian’s/mother’s employment had any impacts
upon the child’s active travel to school and was guided by the findings of previous
studies which showed that mainly mothers had primary responsibility of the children’s
commute to school (McDonald 2008; Rosenbloom 1987; Rosenbloom and Burns 1993).
This study found that female in employment was negatively associated with active travel
to primary school suggesting that children whose mothers were in full-time employment
(unavailable) were less likely to actively commute to primary school. The results agreed
with McDonald (2008) who also found that ‘children whose mothers work full-time and
commute to work in the morning were less likely to walk or cycle to school than children
whose mothers were not leaving for work in the morning’. This finding was also in line with
studies reporting that parental convenience is a significant factor for mode choice to school
(Joshi and Maclean 1995; McDonald 2008; McMillan 2007). On the other hand, there was
no association between mother’s employment and active commuting to secondary school
as youth in secondary school are more likely to commute independently.
   Another factor reflecting a family’s socio-economic status included parental education.
Wong et al. (2011) wrote that this variable has not been commonly investigated. Prelimi-
nary estimations in this study showed a significant association between parents’ education
and active travel to school, but this association was attenuated in the combined-factor
models. Also, univariate tests showed that children with their parents having higher edu-
cation qualification were more likely to walk or cycle to school, but again this association
was not significant in the combined-factor models. This finding is in line with the Scottish
study by Waygood and Susilo (2015) who also found no significant effects between active
travel to school and parental education; that is contrary to evidence reported by Emond
and Handy (2012) in the US.
   Household characteristics such as number of children and housing tenure were signifi-
cantly associated with active commuting to primary school. The more children in a

92       D. POTOGLOU AND B. ARSLANGULOVA
household the more likely children and adolescents were to walk or cycle to school. Also,
living in an owner-occupied property was negatively associated with active travel to
primary school. In the absence of income data, this variable has been introduced as a
proxy variable for socio-economic characteristics pointing to the direction that children
living in households that could afford owning their home were less likely to walk or
cycle to school (Ogilvie et al. 2008). Finally, this finding may interpreted as a proxy for
residential density implying that home owners tend to live at lower residential-density
(car oriented) areas thus encouraging use of cars to accompany children to school
(Waygood 2009). Finally, no association was found between any of the housing-tenure
categories and active travel to secondary school.
    A key strength of this paper is that it offers previously unexplored evidence to better
understand active travel to primary and secondary schools in Wales and thus may
inform future policies to encourage active travel to schools. Other strong aspects of this
study include its sample size along with the careful survey design and weighting of very
recent (2013/2014 and 2014/2015) observations to represent individuals living in Wales.
A potential limitation of this study is that the survey responses regarding children and
youth travel to school came from the guardians’/parents’ perspectives whereas Panter,
Jones, and van Sluijs (2008) asserted that youth perceptions also determine active travel
to school. Findings of this study suggest that parent perceptions influence children and
adolescent active commuting to school, but it might be useful for future studies to
collect data from adolescents’ perspectives and compare findings. Also, given that the
NSW data come from parent/guardian reports may also pose a challenge for like-for-
like comparisons with survey data coming directly from children or adolescents.
Finally, the analysis was based on a strict classification of bus and walk school trips as
non-active trips, though it should be recognised that such trips involve some level of mod-
erate physical activity through walking to and from bus stops to home and school.
6. Conclusion
This paper examined the factors associated with active travel to schools in Wales and con-
trasted these findings between primary and secondary school children. Findings are quite
timely given that The Active Travel (Wales) Act, which became a law in November 2013,
has recently set the policy framework towards improving active travel in Wales. The Act
‘places a requirement to continuously improve facilities and routes for walkers and cyclists
and to prepare maps identifying current and potential future routes for their use. The Act
will also require new road schemes to consider the needs of pedestrians and cyclists at
design stage’ (Welsh Government 2013). Thus, this study provides the evidence base
for local authorities to strategically promote cycling and walking not only around
schools, but also around residencies. The findings of this study also point towards the
development of education programmes aiming at increasing parental awareness and creat-
ing active-travel supporting environments.
    From a policy perspective, findings highlight the importance of involving parents in
encouraging walking and cycling among children. Since there is a relationship between
parents’ active-travel patterns and children and adolescent active commuting to school,
there is scope for ‘beyond-the-school’ active-travel campaigns and intervention pro-
grammes aiming at an overall improvement of family walking and cycling for different

                                                TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY           93
activities. The latter would enable parents to promote and set an example for their children
from a young age (Susilo and Liu 2015).
   Findings in this study also suggest that changes and investment on the physical
environment also influence children and adolescent walking and cycling to school. For
example, the 2005 US Federal Transportation Bill created the Safe Routes to School
Program to ‘enable and encourage children […] to walk and bicycle to school’ and ‘to
make bicycling and walking to school as safer and more appealing transportation alterna-
tive’ (FHWA 2006). The legislation provided each state’s Department of Transportation
with funds to improve infrastructure within two miles of elementary and middle
schools and to develop safety and encouragement programmes. Over $1.1 billion has
been allocated on the programme as part of the original legislation and continuing resol-
utions as of 30 September 2012 (National Center for Safe Routes to School 2013).
   Changes do not always require large investments. Low-cost physical improvements
may involve crossing guards, which do not require any structural improvements and
appear to be particularly effective in reducing barriers and facilitating safe routes to
school (Chriqui et al. 2012). Along these lines, the UK NICE Public Health Guidance
8 provides a lead for further interventions to create safe routes to schools (UK NICE
2008). Demark and the Netherlands, for example, have exhibited high levels of active
travel – despite high incomes – while maintaining positive safety records (low casual-
ties). The latter has been primarily the outcome of safety measures including campaigns
and physical safe routes (e.g. through traffic calming) to school projects at the munici-
pality (local authority) level (Jensen 2008). Also, another intervention may involve
the Walking School Bus concept as a safety measure to mitigate the negative impacts
of non-active travel to school (Waygood et al. 2015). Finally, School Travel
Plans, largely initiated in 2000s across Europe and Australia, and despite the majority
of them being behavioural, do report statistically significant increases in active travel
modes (Buliung et al. 2011). Welsh schools have already started implementing
school travel plans and future work could involve testing correlations between
schools with and without travel plans in Wales and their impacts upon active travel
to school.
