1. Introduction
     Active Transportation is the engagement in physical activity for making trips using one or several human-powered modes of trans-
portation such as walking or cycling (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2013; Sallis et al., 2004). Guidelines in Canada recommend 60
minutes of moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) a day everyday for a child’s and youth’s healthy development
(Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 2011), which can be achieved through combinations of playful and recreational activities and
active transportation. Many studies have highlighted that regular participation in physical activity and/or active transportation may also
enhance a child's social well-being and cognitive abilities (Bürgi et al., 2011; Fusco et al., 2012; Tomporowski et al., 2008). Furthermore,
children who acquire patterns of physical activity at a younger age are expected to carry forward this healthy lifestyle and its bene<U+FB01>ts over
their life span (Bürgi et al., 2011).
     Transportation to and from school is the most common type of travel for children and youth during weekdays of a school year
(Copperman and Bhat, 2007). Many children live within a reasonable walking/cycling distance from school, and for these children, active
school transport (AST: walking and cycling to/from school) can be a great opportunity to accumulate physical activity on a regular basis.
Recent research supports in this hypothesis, with an emerging body of evidence indicating a statistical association between AST uptake

and higher daily physical activity levels among children and youth; a review of this literature can be found elsewhere (Larouche et al.,
2014). However, AST uptake in Western countries has consistently declined over the past decades. For example in the Greater Toronto
Area, Canada, walking to school by 11–13 year old children has declined from 53% to 42% between 1986 and 2006 (Buliung et al., 2009).
This decline in AST levels may have major consequences for children’s health; thus improving AST participation in children and youth is
important for the future health of younger population.
    Researchers, practitioners and community-based organizations alike have recognized that the neighbourhood environment plays an
important role in facilitating AST. Existing literature has reported a strong negative correlation between school travel distance and AST
(e.g., McDonald, 2008; Mitra and Buliung, 2014; Waygood and Susilo, 2015). Some researchers have found positive association between
higher street network connectivity and AST (Panter et al., 2010a), while others have reported higher street network connectivity resulting
in reduced AST rates (Larsen et al., 2012; Giles-Corti et al., 2011). The presence of active transportation infrastructure (e.g., sidewalks,
pedestrian crossings, cycle routes, controlled traf<U+FB01>c crossings) was found to be associated with AST (Mitra and Buliung, 2014; Schlossberg
et al., 2006; Timperio et al., 2006). On the other hand, streets with high traf<U+FB01>c and busy intersections may discourage AST uptake (Giles-
Corti et al., 2011; Larsen et al., 2013). Results related to the land use also remain mixed. Some researchers found mixed-use neighbour-
hoods to associate with walking (McMillan, 2007; Mitra and Buliung, 2014), while others have indicated to the contrary (Larsen et al.,
2012; Yang et al., 2012).
    Recent research has also reported an association between neighbourhood environmental perceptions and a child’s school travel mode
outcomes (e.g., Lee et al., 2013; McMillan, 2007; Panter et al., 2010b). For example, parental perception on a child’s general safety within a
neighbourhood (e.g., “a safe neighbourhood to walk”) was found to correlate with AST (Larsen et al., 2013; McMillan, 2007). With regard to
more speci<U+FB01>c environmental perceptions, concerns about busy street crossings (Larsen et al., 2013; Timperio et al., 2006) and sidewalk
maintenance (Lee et al., 2013) may discourage walking to school. Some studies have indicated a negative statistical correlation between
parental perceptions of heavy traf<U+FB01>c on neighbourhood streets and AST (Hsu and Saphores, 2014; Lee et al., 2013; Panter et al., 2010b);
others found no such association (Larsen et al., 2013; Timperio et al., 2006). Similarly, some researchers reported parental perceptions of
stranger danger to negatively correlate with walking (Larsen et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013), while others found no such association
(Timperio et al., 2006).
    The relationship between these objective (i.e., measurable) and subjective (i.e., perceived) qualities of the neighbourhood environment,
however, has yet to be systematically examined in school transportation literature. Recent theoretical works, such as the ones proposed by
McMillan (2005) and Mitra (2013), have conceptualized that the neighbourhood environment (i.e., objectively measurable neighbourhood
characteristics) informs qualitative perceptions of the neighbourhood, which in<U+FB02>uence household decisions related to a child's school
travel outcome. Within this context, empirical research exploring this relationship is critical in advancing our understanding of the
behavioural processes relating to school travel mode choice, and in informing policy and practice that is centred on creating an enabling
built environment to improve AST rates.
    Socio-demographic characteristics of a household and a child, including household income (Larsen et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012), access
to private automobiles (Mitra and Buliung, 2014; Waygood and Susilo, 2015), parental work commitments (McDonald, 2008; Yarlagadda
and Srinivasan, 2008), and a child’s age (Lee et al., 2013; McDonald, 2008), may also in<U+FB02>uence school travel mode choice. One char-
acteristic that is particularly relevant to this study is a child’s gender, which can be an important determinant of AST. Some North
American studies have reported that male students were more likely to walk to school than female students (Larsen et al., 2013;
McDonald, 2008; Mitra and Buliung, 2014). Some others did not <U+FB01>nd any statistical association between a child’s gender and school travel
mode choice (Lee et al., 2013; McDonald, 2012). However, there exists only a limited literature that has systematically examined gender-
based differences in the school travel mode choice behaviour. For example, McMillan et al. (2006) explored gender-differences in school
travel among students attending grades 3–5 in California, US. Girls were 40% less likely to walk or cycle to school compared to boys, but
the authors did not observe any association between gender-speci<U+FB01>c parental perceptions of neighbourhood safety and AST. In another
study conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, US, Clifton et al. (2011) explored gender-related differences in school travel behaviour among
grades 9–12 students. Girls living in mixed-use neighbourhoods were more likely to drive to school; those living in neighbourhoods with
well connected streets were more likely to use transit. No such associations were found among boys. Leslie et al.'s (2010) exploration of
10–14 year-old children across three states in Australia revealed that girls walked more, but cycled less, than boys. Access to recreational
facilities and a student’s perceived safety for walking/ jogging alone correlated with AST among both genders. Conceivably, caregiver
perceptions of the neighbourhood environment may vary based on a child’s gender, and parents of young girls (compared to boys) may be
more protective of their children’s independent and/or active mobility. The topic, however, remains understudied in current literature.
    This study addresses these two important gaps in the current literature by examining (1) the relationship between the measurable
environmental qualities and parental perceptions of traf<U+FB01>c safety, and (2) the variations of this relationship based on a child’s gender, as
they relate to their school travel mode choice behaviour (more speci<U+FB01>cally, walking versus being driven) in the City of Toronto, Canada.
The <U+FB01>ndings of this study will inform Canadian and North American policy in developing more behaviourally grounded interventions, and
particularly in addressing the gender gap in school travel behaviour.
2. Method
2.1. Conceptual design
    This study builds on previous theoretical works on children’s school travel behaviour (McMillan, 2005; Mitra, 2013), which hypothesize
that school travel mode choice is impacted by multiple levels of in<U+FB02>uence, including household and child/youth characteristics, the urban
environment, and external in<U+FB02>uences (e.g., natural environment and policy context). In particular, Mitra (2013) hypothesized that the
neighbourhood environment in<U+FB02>uences a child’s travel mode outcome through <U+FB01>ve latent mediators (i.e., subjective perceptions):
(1) proximity; (2) traf<U+FB01>c and personal safety concerns; (3) street connectivity; (4) pedestrian facilities and aesthetics; and (5) social
connectedness.

    Recent school transportation research has identi<U+FB01>ed distance/proximity and safety as the two major barriers to AST (McDonald and
Aalborg, 2009; Mitra, 2013). This study speci<U+FB01>cally focuses on the decision between walking, versus driven in a privately owned vehicle,
for trips to school, and the potential in<U+FB02>uence of traf<U+FB01>c safety perceptions. While the importance of personal safety concerns on children’s
mobility (e.g., safety from strangers, as discussed by Lee et al. (2013) and Larsen et al. (2013) among others) is acknowledged, this paper
does not address that aspect of neighbourhood safety. Similar to McMillan (2007) and Mitra (2013), we assume that for young children,
parents take a central role in deciding their child’s school travel mode choice, and consequently, parental perceptions of the neigh-
bourhood safety were examined. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual framework adapted in this study, in which, latent parental perception of a
child’s traf<U+FB01>c safety is conceptualized as a mediator that explains the relationship between the objectively measured built environment
and travel mode outcome (i.e., walk versus driven). In the empirical analysis that follows, direct association between objectively measured
neighbourhood environmental characteristics and mode choice was also examined, which, theoretically, would indicate the presence of
other latent mediators outlined in Mitra (2013) that remain unexplored in this study. Hypothetically, parental/ caregiver perception of
traf<U+FB01>c safety may vary based on a child’s gender, which in turn, may produce different school travel mode outcomes for a young girl
versus a boy.
2.2. Data
    To test the hypotheses of the conceptual framework (Fig. 1), this study utilized data collected through the Project BEAT (Built Envir-
onment and Active Transportation; www.beat.utoronto.ca), which is a multidisciplinary and mixed method research project focused on
children’s mobility and health in Toronto, Canada. School travel data were collected between April 2010 and June 2011 at eight inner-urban
schools (i.e., located within pre-World War 2 neighbourhoods surrounding Toronto’s downtown core) and eight inner-suburban schools
(i.e., located within relatively newer neighbourhoods further away from downtown). Grades 5 and 6 students (likely 10 and 11-year olds)
and their adult caregivers (mostly mothers) participated in the study. The collected data included details on a child’s typical school travel
route, a child's and parent's neighbourhood perceptions, attitudes and activity patterns, as well as socio-demographic characteristics of
the household. A total of 1027 students and their parents/adult caregivers took part in the BEAT study. For the purpose of this research,
data from the caregiver surveys were used to capture parental perceptions. Only home-to-school trip data were analysed in this work.
    Our goal was to understand what stopped a child from walking (or being allowed to walk) to school and being driven instead, a topic
that is typically at the centre of the debate around children's school transportation and physical activity in North American communities.
Observations with travel distance greater than 3.2 km (2 mile; 3.6% of all respondents travelled 43.2 km) were removed from analysis
with an assumption that beyond this distance, walking would not be a feasible travel option for a child. Our preliminary analysis of the
BEAT data showed that 74% of all students who travelled less than 1.6 km (1 mile), and 14% of those who travelled between 1.6 and 3.2 km
(1 and 2 mile) walked to school. None of the survey respondents walked beyond 3.2 km. Moreover, mode shares for bicycle, school bus and
public transit, for travelling o 3.2 km, were 2.1%, 1.7% and 1% respectively, further justifying the exclusion of these travel modes from our
empirical analysis. We recognize that in children’s active transportation literature, walking and cycling are often explored together as
“active” modes of travel. However, the neighbourhood environment-related enablers/barriers to cycling and walking are potentially
different; parental perceptions of safety may also vary across these two modes. In the context of this study, then, combining these travel
modes as “AST” would not be conceptually appropriate. After these adjustments, and after eliminating missing data and outliers, the <U+FB01>nal
data included 720 observations.
2.3. Objectively measured neighbourhood environment
    We hypothesized that (Fig. 1) the neighbourhood environment in<U+FB02>uences school travel mode choice indirectly by informing parental
perceptions. Travel distance from home to school was measured using school travel route data provided by the children, in ArcGIS 10. Five
other school route-based neighbourhood environment variables were measured objectively, by intersecting a child’s travel route with data
from the City of Toronto (i.e., major roads, missing sidewalk, traf<U+FB01>c calming devices and intersections) and other private providers (i.e.,
retail density) (Table 1).

       Business data was obtained from Canadian Business Data (2010.04) provided by Pitney Bowes Software Inc.
    In addition to school travel distance and the characteristics of neighbourhood design, traf<U+FB01>c volume in the neighbourhood streets may
also in<U+FB02>uences parents’ perception of traf<U+FB01>c safety on the route to school (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Larsen et al., 2013). To understand this
relationship, traf<U+FB01>c count data was analysed. Manual traf<U+FB01>c counts were conducted at all intersections surrounding each school, from one-

half hour before to 15 min after the school start time. The process involved counting the number of vehicles at all access and egress points
around a school. Previous research on traf<U+FB01>c safety has reported a correlation between higher traf<U+FB01>c volume and a greater safety risk
(Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Larsen et al., 2013). Accordingly, for each student’s school travel route, the highest intersection count (among all
intersections along the route) was explored as a measure of traf<U+FB01>c volume.
2.4. Parents' perceptions of traf<U+FB01>c safety
    Parents’ responses to seven statements, related to the neighbourhoods in which they live in, were investigated. The surveys asked
parents whether they agreed or disagreed to these statements; the responses were recorded on a 5-point scale where 1 represented
“Strongly Agree” and 5 represented “Strongly Disagree”. A bi-variate logistic regression of walking (versus driven in car) was performed
against each statement. One of the statements – “There are enough crosswalks or traf<U+FB01>c lights to help walkers cross busy streets” was not
associated with walking at a ¼0.10; thus was dropped from further analysis.
    To identify conceptually meaningful environmental perceptions out of remaining six responses, a principal component analysis (PCA) with
varimax rotation (which assumes the factors are uncorrelated) was performed. Two clear factors emerged, namely (a) perception of auto-
mobile safety and (b) perception of neighbourhood walking infrastructure. Table 2 shows factor loadings for each statement. For Multivariate
analysis, two new variables ‘Automobile Safety’ and ‘Walking Infrastructure’ were created using factor loadings described in Table 2.

2.5. Socio-demographic characteristics
    Socio-demographic information collected through the BEAT caregiver survey and Statistics Canada were explored. Informed by the
existing literature, <U+FB01>ve key socio-demographic variables were included in the analysis: child’s gender, number of vehicles available per
licensed driver, mother’s employment status, and median household income. Many respondents in the BEAT survey did not provide
individual level household income data. To rectify the problem, year 2010 median household income data at the dissemination area (DA)
level (The smallest geographical unit in which Statistics Canada releases income data) collected by the Statistics Canada was used (Table 1).
A child’s area of residence was classi<U+FB01>ed as a low-income neighbourhood when the DA-level median household income was less than
median income for the City of Toronto (i.e. CAD 43,291) (Statistics Canada, 2013).
2.6. Multivariate statistical analysis
    A Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) approach was applied to explore the multi-level relationships between the variables relating to
(1) objectively measured neighbourhood environment, (2) parents’ perceptions of traf<U+FB01>c safety (identi<U+FB01>ed using a PCA approach described
in Sections 2.4), (3) socio-demographic characteristics, and (4) school travel mode. Travel mode outcome was measured in the form of a
binary variable indicating a walking versus driven trip to school.
    The analytical framework of the SEM is presented in Fig. 2. Hypothesized directions of in<U+FB02>uence were strategically added between
exogenous variables (i.e., objectively measured neighbourhood built environment characteristics, and household socio-demographics) and
endogenous variables (i.e., environmental perceptions and mode choice), following the conceptual framework outlined in Section 2.1. For
example, Traf<U+FB01>c calming devices and Traf<U+FB01>c counts around school were hypothesized to interact only with perceptions related to
“automobile safety”. Similarly, Missing sidewalks would only in<U+FB02>uencing the perception of “walking Infrastructure”. Major roads crossing,
intersections density, retail density and distance were allowed to interact with both of the perceptions. Finally, socio-demographic,
parental perceptions, the neighbourhood environment variables were hypothesized to directly correlate with the mode choice variable.
    Since all of the endogenous and exogenous variables were either observed or computed using PCA of observed variables, an observed
endogenous variable approach, as explained by Mueller (1996), was adopted for this analysis:
Y ¼ BY þ G X þ <U+03B6> ;
    where Y¼(NY  1) column vector of endogenous variables (NY ¼ number of endogenous variables), X ¼(NX  1) column vector of exo-
genous variables (NX ¼ number of exogenous variables), B ¼(NY  NY) matrix of coef<U+FB01>cients representing the direct effects of endogenous
variables on other endogenous variables, G ¼(NY  NX) matrix of coef<U+FB01>cients representing the direct effects of exogenous variables on
endogenous variables, and, <U+03B6> ¼(NY  1) column vector of errors.
    Separate models were also estimated for boys (n¼ 342) and girls (n ¼378) to assess gender disparities in the AST behaviour. The
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach was applied to estimate the models. All multivariate analyses were performed using SPSS
        s
Amos software. The estimated standardized direct effects are summarized in Figs. 2–4.

3. Results and discussion
     School travel behaviour of n ¼720 grade 5 and 6 children in Toronto, Canada, was analysed using an SEM approach. Among these
children, 52.5% were girls and 47.5% of them were boys; the average age of surveyed children was 10.58 years (Table 1). The mean school
travel distance was 0.76 km. Of all children in the sample, 73% walked to school as opposed to 26% who were driven. Among those
students who lived o3.2 km from school, 67.5% of the girls walked to school as opposed to 78.4% boys (i.e., 32.5% girls versus 21.6% boys
were driven to school).
     Fig. 2 summarizes results from a SEM of walking (versus driven) using pooled sample that included both boys and girls; Figs. 3 and 4
summarize results from models on boys and girls respectively. For each of these models, the ratio of the chi-square (<U+03C7>2) statistic and
degree of freedom (df) was o 3, goodness-of-<U+FB01>t index (GFI) was closer to 1, and the root mean square error approximation (RMSEA) was
r0.05, indicating a good <U+FB01>t for the estimated models.
3.1. Socio-demographic characteristics and walking
     Fig. 2 shows that boys were more likely to walk to school than girls. However, some similarities as well as differences were observed
between boys and girls when explored separately (Figs. 3 and 4). For example, availability of private automobiles (i.e., vehicles per licensed
driver in a household) was negatively associated with walking among both boys and girls. On the other hand, no signi<U+FB01>cant association
was found between mother’s employment status and mode choice for either a boy or a girl. With regard to differences across gender, a
signi<U+FB01>cant positive association was noted between neighbourhood level household income and the likelihood of walking in the case of
boys only.

     Two latent parental perceptions related to a child’s traf<U+FB01>c safety, namely: automobile safety and walking infrastructure, were explored.
Distance, Intersection density, presence of major road crossings en-route to school and heavy traf<U+FB01>c near school were negatively asso-
ciated with parental perception of automobile safety, but this perception did not have a direct effect on a child’s likelihood of walking to
school at a ¼ 0.05 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, parental perception of walking infrastructure played a signi<U+FB01>cant role in in<U+FB02>uencing a child’s
likelihood of walking to school. This perception was negatively correlated with school travel distance and missing sidewalks (i.e., pro-
portion of school route without a sidewalk).
     When travel behaviour of boys and girls were examined separately (Figs. 3 and 4), noticeable differences were found between these
gender-speci<U+FB01>c models and the combined model, echoing with our hypothesis that AST decision process is likely gendered. Our <U+FB01>ndings
related to these differences (and similarities) are discussed below:
3.2.1. Parental perception of automobile safety
     School travel distance and intersection density were negatively associated with parents’ perception of automobile safety for both boys
(Fig. 3) and girls (Fig. 4). Heavy traf<U+FB01>c around school negatively affected parental perception of automobile safety for a boy’s school travel,

                                               A. Guliani et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 2 (2015) 502–511                         509
but not for a girl’s. In contrast, the presence major road crossings was negatively associated with parental automobile safety perception for
a girl’s school travel, but not for a boy’s.
    Traf<U+FB01>c calming devices en-route to school did not associate with this parental perception for either gender, as one might expect
(Figs. 3 and 4). Although traf<U+FB01>c calming devices are commonly believed by planners and engineers to improve pedestrian safety (Lock-
wood, 1997), our results suggest that at least for the 5th/6th grade students in Toronto, such engineered environment may not always
in<U+FB02>uence parents’ subjective perceptions of a child’s safety from traf<U+FB01>c. This observed dissonance between subjective views of the
neighbourhood environment and the objective measures of safety improves our understanding of the AST behaviour.
    With regard to the association between subjective perceptions and school travel behaviour, the models indicated that parents’ per-
ception of automobile safety had a direct positive effect on walking among boys (Fig. 3), but not among girls (Fig. 4). This gender-based
difference resonates with existing literature, which points out that parents encourage boys over girls to take risks or to engage in more
physical activity within the context of a safer and/or enabling environment (Kimm et al., 2005; Morrongiello and Dawber, 1999; van
Mechelen, 2000). Our results indicate the absence of such encouragement towards a grade 5/6 girl, or at least a large variation in the
degree of parental support that produced a statistically insigni<U+FB01>cant effect.
3.2.2. Parental perception of walking infrastructure
    School travel distance and the proportion of school route with missing sidewalk were negatively associated with parental perception of
walking infrastructure in a neighbourhood, for both boys (Fig. 3) and girls (Fig. 4). Intersection density was positively associated with
parental perceptions for boys only.
    Similar to our <U+FB01>ndings in Section 3.2.2, a positive association was found between parents’ perception of neighbourhood walking
infrastructure and walking to school among boys attending grades 5 and 6 (Fig. 3), but not among girls of the same age (Fig. 4). As
explained in Section 3.2.2, this <U+FB01>nding may re<U+FB02>ect a caregiver tendency to be more protective of girls and to place greater restrictions on
girls’ active and perhaps independent mobility.
3.3. Direct effect of the neighbourhood environment
    This study hypothesized that the neighbourhood environment (i.e., measurable characteristics of a neighbourhood) in<U+FB02>uences a child’s
school travel outcome by informing parental perceptions (Fig. 1). While existing theoretical works have identi<U+FB01>ed multiple domains of
perceptual mediators (McMillan, 2005; Mitra, 2013), this paper only focused on one of them, namely, perception of traf<U+FB01>c safety. The
presence of a direct association between the neighbourhood environmental variables and mode choice (i.e., walk versus driven) in the
estimated models, then, would conceivably indicate the presence of other mediators that remained unaddressed here.
    School travel distance was negatively associated with walking among both genders (Figs. 3 and 4), similar to what has been found
elsewhere (Mitra, 2013). In contrast, the presence of traf<U+FB01>c calming measures en route to school was positively associated with walking for
both boys and girls. This <U+FB01>nding is particularly interesting in the context of a lack of statistical association between traf<U+FB01>c calming
measures and the parental perception of automobile safety as discussed in Section 3.2.1, and indicates that although they are primarily
designed to improve travel safety (Lockwood, 1997), traf<U+FB01>c calming devices perhaps in<U+FB02>uence other types of parental perceptions that
were not examined in this research. Nevertheless, these devices may improve the likelihood of walking among elementary schoolchildren.
    Major road crossings appeared to improve the likelihood of walking both for boys and girls, which is contrary to <U+FB01>ndings from some
other studies that have reported a negative association between them (Bringolf-Isler et al., 2008; Mitra and Buliung, 2014). One expla-
nation of this contradictory <U+FB01>nding could be that after accounting for parental safety concerns, the presence of major roads may be
representative of a well-connected street network, which in turn, may enable walking (Mitra, 2013). However, this hypothesis could not be
con<U+FB01>rmed with our data.
    With regard to differences across gender, heavy traf<U+FB01>c near school (i.e., traf<U+FB01>c count) and missing sidewalks (i.e., proportion of school
travel route without sidewalks) were directly associated only with a boy’s travel outcome (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, a negative direct
association was observed between intersection density and walking only among girls.
3.4. Limitations
    The results from this study, however, may not be generalizable beyond what is permitted by the data. First, the study population was
purposefully kept limited to grades 5 and 6 children to avoid variations in behaviour due to different levels of cognitive ability and
independence. Second, only parental perceptions related to a child’s traf<U+FB01>c safety were explored, with an acknowledgement that there
may be other perceptual domains through which the built environment in<U+FB02>uences school travel mode choice decisions. Third, we
recognize that a child’s environmental perceptions and attitudes may have some in<U+FB02>uence on a household’s decisions around school travel
(Mitra, 2013), but the topic remains a subject of our future research.
    Within the scope of this research, however, the <U+FB01>ndings provide novel insights into the relationship between the neighbourhood
environment, parental perceptions of neighbourhood safety, and children’s school travel outcomes. The study also begins to identify
gender-based differences in household decisions around school travel, a topic that remains understudied in current literature but may
have important policy implications.
4. Implications and conclusion
    From an exploration of school travel behaviour in Toronto, Canada, it appears that positive parental perceptions related to a child’s
traf<U+FB01>c safety improves the likelihood of walking to school, particularly among male students attending grades 5 or 6. Our results also
indicated that in Toronto, the household decision processes related to the choice between walking and being driven may vary across
gender. These <U+FB01>ndings improve our understanding of the school travel mode choice behaviour, particularly in relation to the effects of the
neighbourhood-level environment. The <U+FB01>ndings also draws attention to gender-speci<U+FB01>c enablers and barriers to a child’s walking.

     Current interventions in North America aimed at increasing AST rates have remained somewhat tied to organizational mandates and to
a large extent, to the availability of funding. For example in the US, Federally funded and the State Departments of Transportation
administrated Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programmes empower schools to increase walking/cycling uptake and safety of school travel.
Between 70% and 90% of all SRTS funding are earmarked for engineered infrastructure (e.g., sidewalks) improvement (McDonald et al.,
2013). A review of the current interventions in Canada reveals noticeable contrast to the US approach. Community-based Green Com-
munities Canada, with <U+FB01>nancial support from various government agencies, introduced and has implemented School Travel Planning (STP)
initiative in 4 106 elementary and middle schools across Canada (Mammen et al., 2014). Metrolinx, which is the provincial transportation
planning authority for the Toronto Region, partnered with Green Communities Canada from 2009 to 2011 in implementing STP pro-
grammes in the region (Metrolinx et al., 2014). Since 2011, Metrolinx has remained engaged in the promotion of AST through community
mobilization; however, a longer term revenue stream has yet to be identi<U+FB01>ed. Due to limited <U+FB01>nding, the STP interventions have focused
largely on education and promotion, with some engineering components. The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) and several other
school boards across Canada have recently adapted charters for safe and sustainable transportation among students (Toronto District
School Board, 2013). At this point, these documents merely outline a commitment to invest in resources related to STP programmes and
road safety education within schools.
     Several recent studies have evaluated the impact of SRTS programmes in the US using large samples of schools and SRTS projects, and
have reported a signi<U+FB01>cant increase in the AST rate among students attending schools that participated in the SRTS programmes
(McDonald et al., 2014; Stewart et al., 2014). In another recent investigation that included 53 STP case studies across Canada, 17% parents
reported that they were driving less than before (Mammen et al., 2014). Results from our study con<U+FB01>rm from a behavioural perspective,
the importance of capital improvement projects in improving AST, particularly walking. Our results suggest that infrastructure-centred
interventions, such as constructing sidewalks and implementing traf<U+FB01>c calming measures, may increase the likelihood of walking
regardless of parental perceptions of traf<U+FB01>c safety that may attach to these environmental features.
     Another important <U+FB01>nding from this study, which requires adequate attention in policy and practice, is the difference in school travel
behaviour between male and female students. Policy and programmes that focus on improving AST rates should place particular emphasis
on AST undertaking among girls. Our models indicated that the correlates of a girl’s school travel mode can be different than those of a
boy. We also observed a weaker association between parental perceptions and school travel outcome in girls compared to the boys
attending grades 5 and 6. More speci<U+FB01>cally, while parental perceptions of automobile safety and neighbourhood pedestrian infrastructure
likely in<U+FB02>uenced a boy’s school travel mode outcome, these perceptions did not explain the choice between walking versus being driven
for a girl’s morning school trip. Although these <U+FB01>ndings do not fully explain the behavioural mechanisms causing differences in travel
mode outcomes between boys and girls, the results perhaps indicate that parental limits and control on mobility may be stronger for girls
than boys. Unfortunately, however, gender-speci<U+FB01>c school travel interventions are rare in a North American context. While more research
is needed to fully understand this and other gender-based differences in children’s mobility and health behaviour, it is important that
policy and programmes begin to recognize the existence of gender gaps and address them when designing school level interventions with
a goal of improving AST and physical activity among children.
