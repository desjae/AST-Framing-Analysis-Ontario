lationship with gender, where boys were generally more likely to make                    than a decade gone by, there is an imperative need to more compre-
active journeys to school than girls (Leslie et al., 2010; McMillan et al.,              hensively understand the status of, and factors associated with, AST for

children’s travel and physical activity literature include age and adult                 those in public and private schools. This study aims to provide an ex-

    In Hong Kong, education policy broadly encourages attendance of                      dense and highly motorised cities like Hong Kong. Through the <U+FB01>nd-

through the allocation of public school places according to children’s                   that are more walking-friendly, especially for vulnerable groups such as
