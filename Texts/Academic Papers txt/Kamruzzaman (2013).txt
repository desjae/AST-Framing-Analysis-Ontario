Keywords:                                                 Proxy reports from parents and self-reported data from pupils have often been used interchangeably to
School travel behaviour                                   identify factors in<U+FB02>uencing school travel behaviour. However, few studies have examined the validity of
Self-proxy agreement                                      proxy reports as an alternative to self-reported data. In addition, despite research that has been con-
Convergent validity                                       ducted in a different context, little is known to date about the impact of different factors on school travel
