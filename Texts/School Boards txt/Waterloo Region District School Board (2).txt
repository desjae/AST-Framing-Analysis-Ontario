Active and Safe Routes to School
Active and Safe Routes to School (ASRTS) promotes the use of active and efficient transportation for the daily trip to school.
Promoting students’ physical well-being through active and safe routes to school is identified as a strategy related to the operational
priority      of   student       and    staff   well-being     (https://www.wrdsb.ca/learning/2016-19-operational-goals/well-
being/#.WQx5nNIrIdU) in the Strategic Plan (https://www.wrdsb.ca/learning/#.WQx4z9IrIdU). The key performance
indicator is the number of schools with school travel plans that increase active transportation to school.
The Waterloo Region District School Board is a partner in the Active and Safe Routes to School workgroup of Waterloo Region because:
It’s Healthy!
       Active students are more alert and ready to learn

What is Active Transportation and Active and Sustainable School Transportation?
Active transportation refers to any form of human-powered (non-motorized) travel such as walking, cycling, using a wheelchair, scooter,
or skateboard. Students who are bussed can also be encouraged to use active transportation to get to the bus stop.
Active and Sustainable School Transportation (ASST) emphasizes the importance of incorporating active transportation with sustainable
transportation modes, such as using public transit, carpooling or riding the school bus.
Active School Travel Programs in WRDSB Schools
       School Travel (https://www.wrdsb.ca/planning/active-and-safe-routes-to-school/school-travel-planning/) Pla
       (https://www.wrdsb.ca/planning/active-and-safe-routes-to-school/school-travel-planning/)nning
       (https://www.wrdsb.ca/planning/active-and-safe-routes-to-school/school-travel-planning/) – A comprehensive
       process that involves researching and assessing the barriers to active school travel to develop and implement action plans.
       Wayfinding – Signs posted and activities painted on sidewalks within 400 metres of Waterloo elementary schools. The signs and
       painted activities (e.g., hopscotch, paw prints, numbers painted on sidewalks and walking routes) are intended to encourage more
       children to walk or bike to school and to address a perceived barrier of being too far from the school to do so. Learn more about this
       project through the process evaluation report
       (https://chd.region.waterloo.on.ca/en/researchResourcesPublications/resources/ASRTS_SchoolSignagePilotProc
       completed after the initial pilot.
       Walking School Bus (https://www.wrdsb.ca/planning/active-and-safe-routes-to-school/walking-school-bus/) –
        The WRDSB is currently collaborating with the Canadian Cancer Society (https://www.cancer.ca/walkingschoolbus)

     and Block Parents of Waterloo Region on a walking school bus pilot program. A walking school bus is a convenient way for children
     to walk to school safely with adult supervision. Similar to a regular school bus, the Walking School Bus follows an established route.
     Students are picked up and dropped off at planned stops (may be at the student’s home if it is along the route or at a designated
     spot nearby). Groups of approximately 8 students walk to school together under the supervision of a trained adult volunteer.
     Cycling into the Future – Student Bicycle Training (https://www.cyclingintothefuture.com/) – Retired WRDSB
     teacher Philip Martin has developed a bicycle training course for Grade 5 students. This course is designed to help students become
     safe and confident riders. It also gives teachers and parents resources to support and extend learning from the training sessions.
     Participants take part in 5 sessions, with an option for a sixth—scheduled to meet the needs of teachers and their classes. To learn
     more, or book training for your school, contact Philip Martin (mailto:beatles49.pm@gmail.com).
     iWalk (International Walk to School Week/Day (https://ontarioactiveschooltravel.ca/international-walk-to-
     school-month/)) – An annual event in October to promote walking to school. Prizes are awarded for schools that choose to
     participate.
     Ontario EcoSchools Program (https://www.ontarioecoschools.org/) – Schools can earn points towards an Ontario
     EcoSchools certification when participating in Active and Sustainable Transportation programs (under the Environmental
     Stewardship section). Some examples of environmental action/campaign ideas include: if the whole school participates in a walk-
     to-school week to kick off campaign; throughout the week/month/year students track their steps to school; celebrate with a
     “Golden Shoe Trophy” presented at an assembly. Check out the EcoSchools page
     (https://www.ontarioecoschools.org/news/active-and-sustainable-transportation/) for more Active and Sustainable
     Transportation resources.

Active Transportation Charter
Did you know the WRDSB has an Active Transportation Charter? The Charter serves to remind everyone that active transportation is an
important component of a healthy lifestyle and contributes positively to learning. The Charter reinforces the importance of active
transportation supportive policies, infrastructure, and programming. It guides staff, student, parents and the Board of Trustees to
consider how activities and decisions can encourage active transportation.
You can find out more about the charter Active Transportation Charter (https://www.wrdsb.ca/planning/active-and-safe-
