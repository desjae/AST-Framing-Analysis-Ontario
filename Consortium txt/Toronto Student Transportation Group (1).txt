 A majority of students in the city of Toronto live within a reasonable distance for
 walking or wheeling (i.e. travel by bike, scooter or other personal mobility device)
 to their local school. As such, it is important that all students know how to safely
 navigate the streets in their neighbourhood.
 Walking is a legitimate way for students of all ages to get to and from their local
 schools. It not only helps promote physical tness for our students but contributes
 to their overall wellbeing. We understand that it may not be practical for all
 families but we want to encourage as many families as possible to take up this
 active transportation as a means to support healthy children. Many families do not
 consider walking a viable choice but we are here to assist you in addressing those
 concerns. In many cases supervision is a primary reason why students are not
 allowed to walk to school. Our school staff can assist those in need to connect
 these families with others in their neighbourhoods who are walking. Please stay
 tuned as we work towards a walk/ride share program to help schools help families
 makes these connections. We support the creation of ‘school travel plans’ that help identify obstacles in the
 community and working with various stakeholders including the city to begin to address those concerns. Most of all
 we want to share how families are making walking to school a choice as part of their normal working day. There is no
 shortage of information that is available to assist you in identifying ways to make active transportation a viable choice
 for families and we have highlighted a number of these resources below. What’s stopping you from letting your
 children walk to and from school? Let us know, we will work with our community partners to address those concerns
 and make walking a viable, safe, and healthy means for our students to get to and from school.
         When walking or wheeling, travel with friends, family or in groups.
         When crossing the street, obey signalized traf c commands and crossing guard instructions.
