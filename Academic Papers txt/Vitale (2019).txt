Keywords:                                                  Mode choices for school travel are important to children’s health. School size and siting impose constraints on
Active school travel                                       mode choices, and these factors vary considerably along the rural–urban continuum. Using the Halifax Regional

                                                           and catchment area size, rural–urban location, and reliance on school busing. To estimate potential walkability,
                                                           a mean Walk Score® was calculated for a 2.4-km pedestrian zone around each school, which represents the
