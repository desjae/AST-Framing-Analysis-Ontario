Abstract
    This paper examines primary school children’s experiences of travelling between home and school within three neighbourhoods. Our
investigation is set in Auckland, New Zealand, where parental practices such as chauVeuring are commonplace, yet are increasingly recog-
nised as limiting children’s physical Wtness and environmental awareness. Drawing on children’s voices, writing and photographs, we
investigate how children currently travel to school, how they would like to travel, and how their perspectives on neighbourhood space
vary by age, socio-economic status and school location. Findings reveal that over half of the participants did not like the way they trav-
elled to school. Most desire to travel independently within public space, but are limited in their ability to do so, given the fears and obsta-
cles that prevail within their neighbourhoods. We contend that restricted use of public space diminishes children’s agency in inner
suburbs. Our analysis reveals that children favour ‘active travel’ for many of the same reasons as health professionals and transport plan-
ners. We conclude that as long as children are seen as innocents in need of protection, they will have limited agency in travel decisions and
highly contingent access to public space.
