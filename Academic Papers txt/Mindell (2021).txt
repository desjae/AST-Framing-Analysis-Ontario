The five most common ‘other’ responses included unfriendly bus drivers, distrust of other passengers and fears for safety, fears of getting on the wrong bus or off at
the wrong stop, and receiving no help from bus drivers, parents that do not trust the service, or other people, and would not let their children use it, and dislike of
