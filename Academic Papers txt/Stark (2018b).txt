children based on the data of the Austrian household survey2 (car use
36.3%, public transport 22.3%, bicycle 3.4%, walking 38.0%), our
sample shows lower shares of car use in favour of public transport and

     Relating mode choice to trip purpose, a conspicuous fact stands out,
namely, that children walk more on trips to school compared to trips
with other destinations3. Overall, no signi<U+FB01>cant dependencies on
gender and age could be found. The <U+FB01>nding on gender is in line with
other studies (e.g. Potoglou and Arslangulova, 2017; Pojani and
Boussauw, 2014; D'Haese et al., 2011). No relation of mode choice or
