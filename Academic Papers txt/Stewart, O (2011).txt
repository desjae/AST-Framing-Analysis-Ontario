for Safe Routes to School Programs
Orion Stewart1
Abstract
This literature review identified common factors associated with active transportation to school (ATS). It used a conceptual
framework of a child’s commute mode to school to classify 480 variables from forty-two studies that were tested for association
with ATS. Four factors most frequently influenced ATS: distance, income, traffic and crime fears, and parental attitudes and sche-
dules. Regular ATS results in more physical activity but research is lacking on other outcomes. Safe Routes to School, a program
designed to increase rates and safety of ATS, can use an understanding of these influences and outcomes to more effectively allo-
cate its limited resources.
