  Key Messages
   Most children are chauffeured to school, including many of those who live close to their school.
   Distance significantly impacts elementary students’ travel mode choices for the home––school
     journey, especially walk and bus modes.
   Older and smaller elementary schools, especially in densely populated communities, tend to
     encourage walking for the home––school commute.
This research investigates personal, school, neighbourhood, and weather characteristics that are associated
with travel mode choices for children’s direct journeys between home and school. Travel diary and socio-
demographic data were collected from elementary school students aged 5 to 11 years in Halifax, Nova
Scotia, and were joined with characteristics about their respective school, neighbourhood, and weather.
Multinomial and mixed logistic regression were used to examine the relationships between these character-
istics and choices between car, bus, and walk travel modes. Results indicate that personal, school,
neighbourhood, and weather characteristics all impact mode choice decisions, yet distance between home
and school is among the most signi<U+FB01>cant. To promote active travel between home and school, our <U+FB01>ndings
suggest that smaller elementary schools should be sited centrally within compact, high-density neighbour-
hoods that are designed for active travel, thereby minimizing school travel distances and maximizing the
practicality of active travel modes.
