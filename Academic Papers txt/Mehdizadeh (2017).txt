1. Introduction
    Active school travel is one of the main opportunities that parents have to promote physical activity among their children.
Low rates of physical activity are associated with potential health risks among children, such as cardiovascular problems and
bone health issues (Andersen et al., 2006; Biddle et al., 2004), metabolic syndrome (Bell et al., 2007; Pan and Pratt, 2008),
high blood pressure (Leary et al., 2008; Sugiyama et al., 2007) and obesity (Hedley et al., 2004). Furthermore, since active
school travel involves physical activity it could also promote mental health among children (Fotel and Thomsen, 2002; Fyhri
and Hjorthol, 2009).
    “Community school” (i.e. easily accessible schools for pupils in all urban regions), “Safe Route to School” (SRTS),”Walking
School Bus” (i.e. children collectively walk to school in an adult-supervised and timetabled manner), School Travel Plan
(STP), and Optimal School Siting (e.g. proximity of good quality schools in all regions) have been implemented as pro-
grammes targeted to promote physical activity in developed contexts such as North America, Europe, New Zealand, and
Japan (McDonald, 2007; Easton and Ferrari, 2015; Collins and Kearns, 2010; Schoppa, 2012). Meanwhile, research regarding
children's (pupils at elementary schools) active school travel in middle income or developing countries in Western Asia or
the Middle East context remains scant (Mehdizadeh et al., 2016). Iran is an interesting case because the above-mentioned
policies have not been implemented in this country. Furthermore, the overall active travel mode use in Iran is low, both in
the general population and among children (Esteghamati et al., 2011; Hajian-Tilaki and Heidari, 2007; Kelishadi et al., 2010).
Active school travel mainly includes walking in Iran and bicycling is rather uncommon. Consequently, active transport is
here defined as walking and bicycling was excluded in the current study.
1.1. Aims
    The core motivation underlying the current study was to add to the empirical knowledge base about predictors of short
perceived walking time to school and active school travel (walking) in a developing Iranian context. Identifying a threshold
for walking time to school may yield information about how to plan transport and roads around schools. Easily accessible
schools for pupils in all urban regions might increase the probability of active school travel among children. In the current
study, we defined the threshold for perceived walking time to school as the distance where walking starts to decrease
compared to the best performing alternative mode. The best performing alternative mode refers to the mode which is most
frequently selected at each perceived walking time to school (PWTS), excluding walking. Further, a walking time threshold
could be used as a dependent variable for identifying variables that explain why PWTS is below or above the threshold, and
also as an explanatory variable for identifying variables that explain why pupils walk or use a non-active mode in an Iranian
setting. To sum up, this study has two main aims and one intermediate aim:
    1) To identify variables that explain why PWTS was below or above the threshold. This included an investigation of
factors affecting school choice as an explanatory factor for home-to-school distances in Iran.
    2) To identify variables that explain why pupils walk. This included an examination of the role of PWTS as well as
demographic, socio-economic, attitudes, and safety perception for walking.
    3) An intermediate aim was to identify a walking time threshold using a somewhat similar definition as in previous
studies in a new context: Iran.
1.2. Literature review
    The majority of previous school travel studies have been conducted in high income regions such as North America,
Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Meanwhile, the research is meagre in developing countries in Eastern
Europe and, in particular, in less developed low income countries in Asia such as Iran. Table 1 shows important findings and
methodological approaches in some previous studies related to active school travel in different regions of the world.
    In North America, several studies have reported important barriers on children's active school travel. For instance, higher
home-to-school distance (or walking time) has been reported to be the most important explanatory variable on active
school travel (e.g. McDonald, 2008a, 2008b; McDonald et al., 2011). Household socioeconomic status such as increased car
ownership (McDonald, 2005; McDonald et al., 2011; McMillan, 2003), higher income (Babey et al., 2009; McDonald, 2008a;
Vovsha and Petersen, 2005), higher educational degree among mothers (McMillan, 2003), perceived neighborhood safety
problems (e.g. McMillan, 2007; Rothman et al., 2015), and demographic characteristics (e.g. younger children) (McDonald,
2008b; McDonald et al., 2011) were also negatively related to active school travel among children. McDonald (2012) re-
ported that there is a gender gap on school travel in the United States, while Mitra and Buliung, (2015) have found that
gender exert no influences on mode use on school travel among children in Canada.
    Furthermore, several studies have been conducted in Western Europe. These studies have examined demographic, socio-
economic and built-environment characteristics associated with school travel mode use in countries such as the United
Kingdom (e.g. Easton and Ferrari, 2015), Netherlands (Van Goeverden and De Boer, 2013), Belgium (Zwerts et al., 2010),
Scotland (Waygood and Susilo, 2015), Ireland (Nelson et al., 2008), and Scandinavian countries (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009;
Johansson et al., 2011). In these high income countries, several of the studies reported that distance (or travel time) had the
most important role in reducing the probability of active school travel among children (e.g. Cooper et al., 2003; Fyhri and
Hjorthol, 2009; Waygood and Susilo, 2015). Similarly to the North American context, the studies also reported significant

influences of other socio-economic (e.g. car ownership, income), household (e.g. parental educational background) and built
environment factors on walking/cycling.
    Meanwhile, in Eastern Europe, a relatively small body of studies has analyzed active school travel (Broberg and Sarjala,
2015; Loucaides et al., 2010; Pojani and Boussauw, 2014). One study examined the influence of socio-economic and en-
vironmental characteristics on active school travel in Albania (Pojani and Boussauw, 2014). In a very dense urban Albanian
setting, walking had the highest share among available school travel alternatives. The findings also showed that higher
home-to-school distance, car ownership and family income were negatively related to active school travel.
    In addition to the contexts outlined above, some studies have been conducted in Australia and New Zealand. Some of
these studies have shown that built-environment factors like distance has the most important impact on active school travel
(Conlon, 2013; Curtis et al., 2015). In addition, Carver et al. (2013) reported that parental perceptions of traffic safety and
injury risk were important for mode use among children.
    As shown in Table 1, it is evident that a rather meagre body of studies has been conducted in the Eastern Asian and
Middle East context. One study carried out among pupils (aged 13–15 years) found that home-to-school distance had a
negative role on active school travel among students in China (Li and Zhao, 2015). The authors also recommended an
examination of associations between travel time, school choice and modal split in future research. Further, Lin and Chang,
(2010) examined the role of the built environment on children's school travel in Taipei. They reported that a higher shade-
tree density and sidewalk coverage were positively related to walking to school among children.
    Recently, some studies have examined factors important for pupils’ (12–17 years) travels in Tehran, Iran (Ermagun and
Levinson, 2016; Ermagun and Samimi, 2015). These studies analyzed a wide range of policy-sensitive variables and found
that walking time to school, car ownership and safety concerns had a negative role on active travelling to school. Also, two
studies have been conducted in a typical city in the northern part of Iran, Rasht (Hatamzadeh et al., 2016; Mehdizadeh et al.,
2016). Hatamzadeh et al. (2016) found that higher distance, car ownership and age (elementary vs. high school students)
were negatively related to walking among students. Moreover, Mehdizadeh et al. (2016) reported significant heterogeneity
around the mean of walking time to school among a wide range of socio-economic, psychological, and built environment
variables on school travel mode choice. To date, no studies have examined the walking time threshold and factors associated
with this threshold in the Middle East context. There are also no studies that have investigated active school travel by a wide
range of socio-economic, attitudinal and safety factors in this context.
    As mentioned above, distance or time was the most important variable on active school travel in previous work. An
increase in distance or walking time is strongly associated with the probability of active school travel among children
(McDonald, 2008a). For instance, McDonald found that a 10 percent increase in walking time (perceived self-reported
distance)—in essence distance to school—decreased children's walking probability by around 7.5 percent. McDonald and also
McMillan used a self-reported distance measurement and showed that children who lived within one mile (1.6 km) of their
school had a stronger probability of walking to school (McDonald, 2008a; McMillan, 2007). Another study used a self-
reported walking time measure of commuting distance related to use of active modes in school trips (Ermagun and Samimi,
2015). Their results showed that a 1 percent increase in walking time led to a 2.37 percent decrease in active mode use.
    Other studies have reported that the perceived distance should be at 3 km or below for an active modal shift to take place
on school travel (Li and Zhao, 2015; Van Goeverden and De Boer, 2013). However, Timperio et al. (2006) found that 800 m
could be a cut-off for walking and bicycling among children. They also measured distance to school with a proxy variable
(shortest possible route from home-to-school). The large difference in identified threshold between 3 km and 800 m might
be due to different operationalizations and distance measures across studies. However, in Van Goeverden and De Boer
(2013) (a 3 km threshold), the analyses were based on reported distances from home-to-school by the respondents.
    Meanwhile, a small body of studies has examined factors affecting school choice as an explanatory factor for perceived or
actual home-to-school distances (De Boer and Blijie, 2006; Gorard, 1999; Van Goeverden and De Boer, 2013). School choice
could determine the time and distance that a child has to travel, given its residential location (Van Goeverden and De Boer,
2013). The distance and time that a child has to travel to school is associated with the school choice from the collection of
eligible schools (Van Goeverden and De Boer, 2013). For instance, poor accessibility (e.g. by walking), traffic barriers, higher
age, higher income, car ownership, and parental educational degree could relate to higher home-to-school distances to
eligible schools (De Boer and Blijie, 2006; Gorard, 1999; Van Goeverden and De Boer, 2013).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area context
    The study area in the current research was in Rasht. Rasht is the largest city in the northern part of Iran with an area of
180 km2 and a population around 639,951 (Iran National Census, 2011). The urban road network of Rasht is a combination of
narrow streets that result in limited car flow and a dense traffic on the inner-city main roads. Some public transit modes,
such as metro and tram systems, are not available in Rasht. Public transport in Rasht includes urban scheduled buses and
carpooling (public) taxis. The carpooling taxis have dedicated stations across the city. Narrow streets, a lack of well-
maintained pavements and poor public transport facilities are important characteristics of the transport system in Rasht.
Also, the bicycling use among youth and the general population is limited. Subject to a fee, some schools also provide

                                          M. Mehdizadeh et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 6 (2017) 313–326                                            319
transport services for their pupils. The number of public and private primary schools are 123, and 122, respectively in Rasht.
Also, the price of gasoline is overall cheaper in Iran (average price of 0.39 $ per liter) than in the rest of the world (average
price 0.99 $ per liter).
    The city of Rasht has some interesting characteristics that motivated us to select it as a case in the present study. First, the
general urban transport patterns, the public transport system and the low proportion of walking/bicycling rates are rather
similar to most Iranian cities and less developed countries in the Middle East (Hatamzadeh et al., 2016; Mehdizadeh et al.,
2016). Further, like most other cities in Iran, Rasht has warm summers and cool winters which may influence choices of
transport on children's school travel.
2.2. Sample
    The respondents were parents of elementary pupils (7–9 years). Based on pupils’ demographic proportions (e.g. gender),
the socio-economic status of different regions of the city and type of school proportions, a random stratified sampling
procedure was carried out. A total of 1078 questionnaires were distributed among pupils in 9 schools in 2014. The pupils
were requested to bring the forms home to be completed by their parents. After two days, 80 percent of the questionnaires
were returned (n ¼858). Uncompleted questionnaires (n ¼123) were not included in further analyses, which left a total of
735 cases available to analysis. Written consent was obtained from the parents.
2.3. Measures
    Different measures that were applied in the study are outlined and explained in this section. Table 2 also shows variables
that were included in the questionnaire. The parents were asked to report the frequency of how often they chose each mode
(walking, car, school service, public transport, and other) on their children's school travels in the previous week (the
maximum was five times). Further, Information was collected about children's and parental demographic and socio-
economic characteristics. The access to school service (e.g. school bus, carpooling), accessibility to public transport and
perceived safety of walking facilities in the home-to-school route was recorded. Parental attitudes towards walking were
measured with a revised version of a validated 23-item instrument (Transport for London, 2011; Mehdizadeh et al., 2016).
Parents reported their consent to the attitudes items on a five point Likert scale, (1) ‘completely disagree’ to (5) ‘completely
agree’.
    The parents also reported their perceived walking time to school (as a proxy to active travel time and distance) in
minutes. Also, PWTS and the shortest possible path in Google Earth between residential districts-and-school distances were
strongly related. Several previous studies used a self-reported (or approximate) walking time and physical distance measure
(Ermagun and Samimi, 2015; McDonald, 2008a; McMillan, 2007; Timperio et al., 2006). Further, Nelson et al. (2008) showed

that there were no significant differences between self-reported physical distance and actual distances, indicating that
perceived distance is a valid proxy to actual distance.
2.4. Statistical analysis
    Descriptive statistics were applied to detect the PWTS threshold for active mode use on school trips. In this way, the plot
of the number of children walking versus the PWTS was used to identify the threshold. Pearson's chi-square (<U+03C7>2) tests were
used to investigate proportion differences in socio-economic status, household factors and modal split across short and long
PWTS groups. Independent samples t-tests were applied to examine mean differences in walking attitudes between those
who had short PWTS and those who had long PWTS. Principal component analyses (PCA) with iteration and varimax
roation were applied to explore walking attitudes dimensional structures. To determine the number of dimensions Kaiser
criterion and the Scree plot were applied. Cronbach's a coefficients were calculated to test scale reliability and internal
consistency. To predict active school travel versus inactive modes (0 ¼inactive, 1¼ active modes), and short PWTS versus
long PWTS (0 ¼long, 1¼short), two binary logistic regression analyses (n¼ 735) were carried out. The predictors were added
in two models using the enter method in SPSS 21.0 statistical software package. In addition to the variables that are found
statistically significant in a 95% confidence interval, all non-significant examined variables have been adjusted for and
reported in the two models.
3. Results
3.1. Detecting the PWTS threshold for active modes
    PWTS ranged from one minute to 120 min. The mean PWTS was 25.00 min (Std. deviation¼ 20.22). About 50% of parents
perceived a PWTS of more than 15 minutes, while 15 percent perceived more than 40 min. The PWTS threshold has been
defined as the time where the walking frequency starts to decrease compared to the best performing alternative mode.
Descriptive analyses (Fig. 1) showed that 10 min PWTS was the threshold in the current sample. Hence, it was assumed that
a PWTS equal to or less than 10 minutes constituted a short trip where active mode use is more prominent than each of the
other modes, and more than 10 minutes is a long trip to school where active school travel is low compared to the best
performing alternative mode. In this time interval (10 min), the frequency of walking and the best performing alternative
(school service) was 39 and 38 times, respectively. After the 10 minute threshold, the walking frequency was substantially
reduced to 19 times, and school service was the most frequently chosen mode (Fig. 1). Pearson's chi-square test also showed
that modal use by short and long PWTS differed significantly ( <U+03C7> 2 (df¼ 4) ¼206.80, p ¼ 0.000).

3.2. Demographic and household factors among the two PWTS groups (short and long trips)
    Proportion differences in socio-economic and household factors across short and long PWTS were examined by Pearson's
chi-square test (Table 3). The share of each variable group: Type of school, monthly income, parental age, car ownership,
father's education, mother's education, father's job, mother's job, income level, accessibility to public transport, and access
to school service were significantly different across the two PWTS groups.
3.3. Walking attitude scores by PWTS (short and long trips)
    Descriptives for the walking attitude items separated for those who perceived short and long PWTS are reported in
Table 4. As shown, the item “Good design of streets makes walking more enjoyable'' had the highest score in the short and long
PWTS groups. Parents who perceived short walking time to school reported more agreement to walking attitudes such as
“Walking is a convenient way of getting about'',“ Walking is an interesting way to travel",“ I feel more relaxed when I walk to my
destination",“ I don’t think there is enough pedestrian information and signposts in my local area", and “Walking for 15 minutes is
something I would happily consider". These parents also reported less agreement to the item “Walking is a method of transport
that you would want to be seen using".

(a ¼0.679, aiic¼ 0.54, ev¼ 16.39%) and included three items (W22, W20, and W21) that described evaluations of the street

ev¼13.27%) included three items (W17, W10, and W16) which illustrated that people dislike walking in dirty, vandalized and

3.5. Predictors of short versus long PWTS
    Table 5 shows that the model significantly predicted short versus long PWTS ( <U+03C7> 2 ¼78.535, po0.001). Attending to a
public school, accessibility to public transport, access to school service, and favourable ‘contextual and design preconditions
for walking’ were negatively related to short PWTS. Increased household income level, and parental age were positively
related to a short PWTS.
3.6. Predictors of active mode (walking) versus inactive modes
    Table 6 shows that the model significantly predicted active school travel versus inactive modes (Model <U+03C7> 2 ¼253.623,
p o0.001). A short walking time to school was strongly associated with active school travel. Mother's driving license, more
owned cars, higher mother's educational degree, accessibility to public transport, and access to school service were ne-
gatively related to active school travel.
4. Discussion
    The findings showed that a 10 min perceived walking time to school was the maximum threshold where the proportion
of active mode use started to decrease compared to the best performing alternative mode. A 10 min PWTS seems to re-
present a short trip to school that increases the probability of children's physical activity in this Iranian setting. When the
groups of short and long PWTS were compared, certain demographics such as parental age, household income, accessibility
to public transport, type of school (public vs private), school service status (De Boer and Blijie, 2006; Gorard, 1999; Van
Goeverden and De Boer, 2013) and psychological factors (parents’ attitudes towards walking) were also significant pre-
dictors of a short perceived walking time to eligible schools.

324                                 M. Mehdizadeh et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 6 (2017) 313–326
    Older parents perceived a shorter walking time to school than younger parents. This could suggest that older parents
tend to live closer to their children's school than younger parents. Households that reported a higher monthly income
tended to have a shorter trip to school. This could reflect that more wealthy parents reside close to schools, were housing
usually is more expensive. These findings are in contrast with some previous studies in Western Europe (Van Goeverden and
De Boer, 2013; De Boer and Blijie, 2006). They reported that higher household income and age were related to higher home-
to-school distances to eligible schools. Intriguingly, parents who had registered their child in public schools perceived a
longer walking time than those who had children registered in private schools. This supports the idea that private school
locations are more scattered and more available in diverse neighborhoods than public schools in Iran (Ermagun and Samimi,
2015; Mehdizadeh et al., 2016). Among psychological factors, considering stronger 'Contextual and design preconditions’ like
dirty, vandalized and unsafe streets and sidewalks for walking in local areas, may decrease short PWTS to eligible schools in
neighborhood in Iran.
    When the groups of active mode (walking) versus inactive school travel modes (i.e. car, school service, public transport,
and other motorized modes) were compared, perceived walking time to school (as a measure of distance), some char-
acteristics of mothers (their driving license status and educational background), car ownership, accessibility to school
service and public transport were important predictors of active school travel in Iran. In line with several previous studies
(see Table 1) that have been conducted in North America (e.g. McMillan, 2007), Western Europe (e.g. Nelson et al., 2008),
Australia and New Zealand (e.g. Curtis et al., 2015), perceived walking time to school was the most important predictor of
active school travel in Iran. Based on findings of the current study and several studies in different regions, it may be that
distance from home-to-school is the most critical variable for active school travel rather independently of cultural context.
    When PWTS was short (r10 min) the probability of children walking to school increased 15.24 times more than on long
walking trips ( 410 min). In order to promote physical activity among children, policymakers could consider the 10 min
PWTS threshold in policies aimed to promote active school travel. If we assume that the children median walking speed is
4.3 kph (2.7 mph) (McDonald, 2008a) then, by translating walking time to physical distance, it can be concluded that our
PWTS threshold is equal to 0.71 km (0.45 mile). One previous study reported 1.6 km (1 mile) distance to school as a
threshold for increased active travel among pupils in the United States (McMillan, 2007). McDonald (2008a) reported a
1.6 km (1 mile) threshold that all pupils live in an area of 3 mi2; a 0.8 km (0.5 miles) threshold equates to an area of 0.8 mi2,
assuming circular neighborhoods in the United States whereas, Timperio et al. (2006) reported a 800 m (0.5 mile) threshold
in Australia.
    Regarding the role of gender for mode use, this variable did not have a consistent and definite role on children's active
school travel in prior studies. In the current study, we did not find any gender differences on active school travel. Although
some studies have reported that more boys actively travel to school in Western Europe (e.g. Nelson et al., 2008; Easton and
Ferrari, 2015), some studies did not reveal any gender differences, for instance in Canada (e.g. Mitra and Buliung, 2015) and
Iran (Mehdizadeh et al., 2016). Studies to come could investigate whether the lack of a gender difference in mode use
choices on school travels is a general tendency in the Middle East context.
    In schools that offer carpooling services the probability of children's walking to school was lower than in schools that did
not offer such services. In Iran, both public and private schools are common and households pay high fees for registering
their pupils’ in private schools. Those who are able to pay these fees are usually wealthier than parents with children in
public schools where registration is free of charge. However, the type of school was not found to be a significant factor on
active school travel in the present study. On the contrary, a study in Toronto concluded that children who attended private
schools had a stronger tendency to use carpooling and school services (Mitra and Buliung, 2015). The type of school has not
reflected a consistent role on mode use in different regions of the world (see also Table 1).
    Regarding the relative role of other socio-economic and household variables for mode use among children, those chil-
dren with mothers who had a driving license and higher educational degree were less likely to walk to school. Although
some previous studies reported similar findings (e.g. McMillan, 2003), this variable has also shown inconsistency in relation
to mode choice across studies. Well-educated mothers might experience more worry regarding traffic safety or security on
their children's active school trips. Future work could focus on interaction models to obtain more accurate knowledge about
how, for instance, parental education and worry operate together in influencing active travel mode use among children. Of
note, parental attitudes dimensions towards walking did not relate to active mode use. This suggests that more active mode
use on school trips cannot be expected by merely aiming to influence cognitive evaluations of walking through attitude
interventions among parents.
    Higher access to car had a strong negative impact on children's active school travel in the current study. In line
with several studies in high income societies, such as North America (e.g. McDonald et al., 2011) and Western Europe
(e.g. Van Goeverden and De Boer, 2013), household car ownership had negative impacts on active school travel in Iran. This
variable has a rather reliable negative role on active school travel in different regions of the world (Table 1). Policymakers
should manage car use demand in urban roads to prevent the probability of using car on school travel.
4.1. Limitations
    Information about urban form and residential density characteristics were not gathered in the survey. These variables
might be related to school siting, PWTS and active mode choice. Further, this study used a perceived self-reported measure
of walking time. For spatial planners actual walking time might be more informative than the perceived time, which should

                                                M. Mehdizadeh et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 6 (2017) 313–326                                        325
be considered as a proxy variable. However, it was complicated to implement a measure of actual walking time in the
current study because it is difficult for researchers to access Iranian population registries and to obtain adequate information
about residential addresses. Further, the information in the registers is inaccurate and unreliable. In addition, the data had
some limitations regarding interpretations of the PWTS threshold. The perceived walking time in minutes above 10 minutes
were 5-min intervals (e.g. 10, 15, 20 …). For example, although respondents had the opportunity to report values between 10
and 15 min (i.e. 11, 12, 13, and 14 minutes), most of them still would have rounded off to 10 or 15 minutes. However, the
possible inaccurateness of the 10-min PWTS threshold value had no large impact on the main results. For instance, the
sensitivity analysis showed that a 15 min threshold had no substantially different results regarding the main aims.
    The present study did not examine interaction terms between the predictors of perceived walking time threshold and
active school travel. For instance, a third variable may be correlated with another factor that has a strong influence on PWTS
or active school travel. The current study did not incorporate interaction terms in order to avoid too complicated models.
However, future studies could examine interactions terms with the predictors that we used in the present study. Fur-
thermore, the present study was based on cross-sectional and self-reported data which impose limitations regarding causal
inferences and potential socially desirable responses.
5. Conclusions
    This study adds to the knowledge base of the active school travel literature. In contrast to many studies that have been
conducted in developed regions in North America, Australia, and Western Europe, this study was conducted in the Middle
East context, Iran. The findings showed that similarly to other contexts, home-to-school distance or walking time (where
bicycling is uncommon) is the most important barrier on children's active school travel. Several previous studies reported a
cut-off for walking, bicycling use (or active school travel) with somewhat similar definitions in a Western context, but this is
the first study to do this in an Iranian context. What we defined as a threshold in this study is the cut-off time where the
walking frequency starts to decrease compared to the other best performing alternative transport mode. To the authors’
knowledge, the current study is the first that have examined a wide-range of factors (socio-economic, household char-
acteristics, safety perception about walking facilities and walking attitudes) potentially affecting school choice as an ex-
planatory factor for perceived home-to-school walking time in a Middle East context. Also, a scant body of research has
examined socio-economic and urban form characteristics on perceived walking time to school independently of country
context. In this Iranian setting, active school travel mode choice tended to decrease by a lower time threshold compared to
other countries in the world. Furthermore, this study found that favourable attitudes towards walking among parents might
be important for perceived home-to-school walking time.
