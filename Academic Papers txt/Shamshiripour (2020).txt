    these shifts would help different students burn extra walking calories (i.e. the extra calories each                   mode choice
    student burns due to walking more). We estimate multiple discrete continuous extreme value
    models to understand how flexible a student is in combining his/her most preferred transporta-
    tion mode with other choices. Various sources of inter-personal heterogeneity are also captured
    by using a latent-classification framework as well as differentiating the before-school from after-
    school trip chains to consider the behavioral distinction, explicitly. Several explanatory variables
    are incorporated into the models, including socio-demographics of students and their household,
    land-use, crime prevalence, and seasonal/weather conditions. Per the results, improving safety of
    Chicago from its current condition to the national median, would encourage students to be up to
    40% more active. This extra active travel demand would provide obese students aged 14–18 with
    18% of the calorie burn they need to lose weight to the obesity cutoff and 13% of the calorie
    burn required for losing weight from the obesity cutoff to overweight.
