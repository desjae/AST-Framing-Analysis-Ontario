Abstract
Children’s independent mobility (CIM), or a child’s freedom to explore their neighbourhood unsu-
pervised, is important for their psychological development and potentially enables daily physical
activity. However, the correlates of CIM remain under-studied particularly in terms of the influence
of the neighbourhood environment. Within this context, children’s independent mobility in
Toronto, Canada, was examined using linear regression and ordered logit models. Findings demon-
strate that a higher level of CIM was correlated with more physical activity. Parental perceptions
related to neighbourhood safety, stranger danger and sociability were associated with CIM. A child’s
independent mobility was also correlated with age, sex, language spoken at home and parental
travel attitudes. Interventions to increase CIM should focus on enhancing the neighbourhood social
environment. Increasing the independent mobility of girls and of children with diverse ethno-cultural
backgrounds are also worthy of particular research and policy attention.
