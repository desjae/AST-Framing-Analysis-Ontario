  abstract = {With the growth of online social network platforms and applications, large amounts of textual user-generated content are created daily in the form of comments, reviews, and short-text messages. As a result, users often find it challenging to discover useful information or more on the topic being discussed from such content. Machine learning and natural language processing algorithms are used to analyze the massive amount of textual social media data available online, including topic modeling techniques that have gained popularity in recent years. This paper investigates the topic modeling subject and its common application areas, methods, and tools. Also, we examine and compare five frequently used topic modeling methods, as applied to short textual social data, to show their benefits practically in detecting important topics. These methods are latent semantic analysis, latent Dirichlet allocation, non-negative matrix factorization, random projection, and principal component analysis. Two textual datasets were selected to evaluate the performance of included topic modeling methods based on the topic quality and some standard statistical evaluation metrics, like recall, precision, F-score, and topic coherence. As a result, latent Dirichlet allocation and non-negative matrix factorization methods delivered more meaningful extracted topics and obtained good results. The paper sheds light on some common topic modeling methods in a short-text context and provides direction for researchers who seek to apply these methods.},

Several linear causal pathway models have been developed to understand the influences on children's independent mobility; however feedback loops between and within the various levels of influence cannot be modelled using such an approach. The purpose of this paper is to refine the interrelationships of factors related to children's independent mobility, taking into account earlier models, broader contextual factors, recent children's geographies literature, and feedback loops. Systems model components were informed by attributes known to influence children's independent mobility, related qualitative findings, and the development of a framework that could lend itself to multilevel modelling approaches. This systems model may provide a useful structure for identifying how best to develop and monitor interventions to halt the declining rates of children's independent mobility.},

Methods: A total of 53 10- to 13-year-old children from one public school were included. The children were randomised into either a cycling group or a control group. The cycling group was encouraged to cycle to and from school each day during a period of 12 weeks. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) and anthropometrical data (weight and height) were measured at baseline and at the end of the 12-week period. Results: No significant differences were observed in VO2peak change over the 12-week period between the cycling group and the control group (49.7 ml O2/min/kg vs. 50.6 ml O2 /min/kg; effect size=-0.13, F=0.495, p=0.486). Within the intervention group, 69.2\% (95\% CI 50.1\textendash 88.2) started cycling, and within the control group 40.8\% (95\% CI 20.9\textendash 60.5) started cycling. Given that several children in both groups (intervention and control) started cycling to school, re-analyses were conducted between those starting cycling and those not starting cycling. At follow up, a significant difference between those starting cycling and those who did not starting cycling was observed in VO2peak (51.7 ml O2/min/kg vs. 47.9 ml O2/min/kg; effect size=0.49, F=8.145, p=0.007), after adjustment for baseline scores, gender and age. Conclusions: This study indicates that cycling to school improves cardiorespiratory fitness.},

In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering 'black boxes' where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for \$\$n\$\$\,=\,all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

  abstract = {Research about school travel and the built environment developed using positivist and post-positivist onto-epistemologies often relies heavily on travel surveys, activity diaries, GPS tracking, and the ''objective'' measurement of built environment features using geographical information systems and planimetric data. That work takes up and applies specialized disciplinary and practice-based language (e.g., planning and engineering) and concepts that are used to describe, measure, and design the built environment. In this paper, we explore differences in how parents think about the built environment and school transport and the ways in which the built environment and transport are conceptualized in planning. The presence of conceptual asymmetry between a scholar's ''model'' and the ''lived experience'' of parents and children may have implications for the efficacy of school travel-related policy and planning. We use Bronfenbrenner's social ecological model to guide a thematic analysis of 37 interviews with parents about school travel behaviour in Toronto, Canada. We found that parents' experiences of the built environment are complex and varied, with different features influencing individual parents differently, and at varying levels of the ecological model. For example, mixed-use development, often held up as a necessary condition for tackling automobility, was cited as a desirable aesthetic background for driving. We were able to locate examples of conceptual asymmetry but also agreement \textendash{} particularly about traffic around schools. For example, parents expressed divergent views on the impact of heavy traffic on walking, with some describing traffic and traffic safety as barriers to walking, while others indicated that resistance to driving in traffic motivated a choice to walk. Our study serves as a call to planners and geographers to better attend to the lay, everyday onto-epistemologies that shape parents' lived experiences of travel to school.},

  abstract = {Introduction Active school travel (AST) can be a viable way to increase children's low levels of daily physical activity by promoting opportunities to walk and wheel. To promote AST in Canada, School Travel Plan (STP) programs have been implemented throughout the country. The STP program is a comprehensive 2-year intervention that is facilitated by a committee of community and school partners who implement education, encouragement, enforcement, and engineering initiatives at their school to support AST. Methods This study examines the impact of the STP program on children's and parents' perceptions of AST barriers, and children's engagement in AST from pre- to post-intervention. In total, 13 elementary schools representing a total sample of 4720 parents and 2084 children from across Southwestern Ontario, Canada were involved in this program evaluation. Results Findings indicate that the STP program was successful in significantly reducing children's and parents' perceptions of AST barriers. An analysis of travel behaviour found the STP program was limited in affecting behavioural change, as the results show an insignificant trend of increasing AST use and decreasing car use. Conclusions Changing perceptions of AST barriers suggests that the STP intervention has the potential to change intentions and motivation for parents and children, which may lead to significant increases in future AST. This study recommends that future interventions focus on parental education and empowerment initiatives to reduce an apparent intention-behaviour gap that exists in their AST decision making process.},

Active school travel (AST) methods, such as walking and wheeling to school, can be a valuable way to increase children's levels of daily physical activity. In Canada, Active and Safe Routes to School (ASRTS), a national health promotion initiative, has led the campaign for AST through its flagship school travel plan (STP) program. At present little is known about the on-the-ground implementation processes that impede or facilitate the success of STPs. Through a thematic analysis of 18 interviews with STP facilitators and 4 focus groups with the larger STP committees, our study evaluates the factors shaping the functioning of STP interventions at ten elementary schools participating in a regional ASRTS program in Southwestern Ontario. Our analysis yielded six themes that have implications for STP implementation and sustainability: 1) accounting for school context; 2) establishing committee capacity and leadership; 3) supporting STP action; 4) responsiveness to external and internal barriers; 5) engaging schools at the grassroots level; and 6) building future champions. We draw from Lewin's Field Theory and discuss the forces affecting STP committees to frame our findings in a way that can be discussed to support the building of efficient, effective, and viable AST intervention environments.},

The modeling framework assumes that a student's choice for the mode of travel to school is impacted by numerous factors such as neighborhood crime rates, traffic safety, built environment amenities, and socio-demographic factors. A generalized linear model is employed to capture longitudinal changes in the mode share of students who walk or bike to school based on data collected from 53 schools in the city of Seattle, Washington. The modeling results indicate that (1) enhanced sidewalk modifications and bike lane accommodations encourage students walking and biking to school; (2) the implementation of Seattle's student assignment plan helps promote students walking to school possibly due to the change from school choice to neighborhood-based school assignment; (3) the size of the school attendance area is not significantly correlated with students' active travel activities, while the size of school enrollment is negatively associated with walking; (4) in school areas with high employment density, biking to school may be a more attractive option for students; (5) greater crosswalk density may encourage more students to walk to school; (6) the density of bike crashes is negatively associated with students biking to school. In terms of policy implications, transport planners should continually promote walking and biking supportive environments and implement policies to encourage active student travel.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the last decades, the use of active travel modes declined in all age groups. Childhood is a critical time to establish lifelong healthy patterns. To develop effective interventions in this age group, insight in the correlates of health behaviors and the possible mediating factors is necessary. Among children, the role of parents may not be overlooked. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the associations of parental perceptions of neighborhood environmental attributes with active transport and total physical activity in 10-12 year old Belgian boys and girls. Furthermore, this study examined the potential mediating effect of independent mobility on these associations. METHODS: In the present study, 736 10-12 year old children and their parents from 44 elementary schools in Flanders, Belgium, participated. The children were asked to wear an activity monitor and to fill in a survey questioning demographic factors and the Flemish Physical Activity Questionnaire. The parents filled in a survey concerning demographic factors, the child's level of independent mobility and environmental perceptions (Neighborhood Environmental Walkability Scale). RESULTS: Overall, boys reported more active transport when parents perceived more land use mix diversity, shorter distances to school, good land use mix access, higher residential density and less pleasing neighborhood aesthetics. Higher total physical activity levels were reported when parents perceived shorter distances to school and availability of walking/cycling infrastructure. None of the associations was mediated by independent mobility in boys. Girls reported more active transport when parents perceived higher residential density, more land use mix diversity, shorter distances to school, good land use mix access, available walking/cycling infrastructure and convenient recreational facilities. Girls reported higher total physical activity levels when parents perceived high residential density, good land use mix access, well-maintained and high quality walking/cycling infrastructures and more traffic safety. Independent mobility was found to be an important mediator of these associations in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood environmental interventions to increase children's active transport and physical activity can be effective when combined with awareness raising programs for parents. Furthermore, among girls encouraging independent mobility may contribute to behavior change.},

Innovative solutions that increase PA time for children, without putting added pressure on the school curriculum, merit consideration. Before implementing such solutions, it is important to demonstrate that active school transport is associated with health-related outcomes. METHODS: Following a standardized protocol, we conducted a systematic review of published research to address this question and explore whether children who actively commute to school also have a healthier body weight. Online searches of 5 electronic databases were conducted. Potential studies were screened on the basis of objective measures of physical activity. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review. Nine studies demonstrated that children who actively commute to school accumulate significantly more PA and two studies reported that they expended significantly more kilocalories per day. Where studies examined body weight (n=10), only one reported active commuters having a lower body weight. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that active school commuters tend to be more physically active overall than passive commuters. However, evidence for the impact of AST in promoting healthy body weights for children and youth is not compelling.},

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 785 children (10.57 {$\pm$} 0.7 years) in Toronto, Canada. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry and travel mode was self-reported by parents. Linear regression models accounting for school clustering effects examined the associations between mode choice, BMI, and physical activity and were estimated adjusting for age, types of neighbourhoods and travel distance to school. RESULTS: Significant associations between walking to school and moderate activity during weekdays were found. Interactions between walking to school and travel distance to school were found only in boys with significant associations between walking to school and higher physical activity levels in those living within 1000-1600 meters from school. Boys walking to school and living in this range accumulated 7.6 more minutes of daily MVPA than boys who were driven. CONCLUSIONS: Walking to school can make a modest but significant contribution to overall physical activity. This contribution was modified by travel distance and not school neighbourhood socioeconomic status or the built environment.},

The Built Environment and Active School Transport (BEAT) project was undertaken to explore the ways in which the transport-BE interface gives rise to the use of active or non-active travel modes as the primary travel mode for school trips. We wanted to know how children experienced and understood the transport-built environment relationship. We selected four Toronto elementary school sites in areas that differed with respect to socio-economic status and built environment. We conducted photovoice interviews with 41 children, 21 who walked to/from school, and 20 who were driven. Adopting a thematic analytic approach, this paper examines the similarities and differences in the visual narratives of children's transport geographies and discusses some of the benefits of using photovoice with children in a study of the transport-built environment relationship.},

We explain how this technique works, how different choices by the researcher affect the results and how the results can be meaningfully interpreted. To demonstrate its usefulness for journalism research, we conducted a case study of the New York Times coverage of nuclear technology from 1945 to the present, partially replicating a study by Gamson and Modigliani. This shows that LDA is a useful tool for analysing trends and patterns in news content in large digital news archives relatively quickly.},

Based on several studies, the paper describes how Denmark has obtained a good child road safety and why Danish children choose to walk and cycle. Child road safety has predominantly been improved due to higher seat belt use and many implemented local safety measures such as campaigns and physical safe routes to school projects. It is mostly safe routes to school projects that include speed reducing measures and signalisation of junctions that are successful. The distance from home to school is an important factor in children's transport mode choice. Since about half of Danish children have less than 1.5km to school the decentralised school structure with many fairly small schools is an important reason to the many walking and bicycle journeys. Road design and motorised traffic volumes do influence children's mode choice, but to a rather limited extent.},

This approach revealed the significance of the following factors: perceived distance and time constraints; concerns about children's health and fitness, as well as their competence; road safety and congestion issues; and social norms. We conclude that the reasons leading parents to drive are manifold, and, as such, a variety of interventions is needed to promote walking.},

  abstract = {Introduction Cycling to/from school can increase physical activity and physical fitness, but it is uncommon among North American children. Few studies have examined the correlates of cycling to/from school. We examined the concordance between children's preferred and actual school travel mode, and compared children who are driven to or from school but who would prefer to cycle (''potential school cyclists'') with those who prefer to be driven (''non-school cyclists''). Methods 988 children aged 9\textendash 12 years were recruited in neighborhoods that differed in built environment and area-level socio-economic status within the City of Toronto. Each child wore an Actigraph accelerometer for 7 consecutive days and reported preferred and actual school travel modes. Objective measures of height and weight were obtained. Parent surveys provided household socio-demographic information. Binary logistic regression analyses compared potential school cyclists and non-school cyclists for morning and afternoon trips. Results Although only 2\textendash 3\% of children cycled to or from school, about 40\% indicated a preference to do so, including about 50\% of children who traveled by motorized vehicle. For the morning trip, children who participated in the study in the spring and those who had a lower body mass index were more likely to indicate a preference for cycling. For the afternoon trip, higher PA, greater independent mobility, and having at least one parent working part-time were associated with children׳s stated preference for cycling. Conversely, children who spoke a language other than English at home were less likely to indicate a preference for cycling. Conclusion Many children in Toronto would prefer to cycle rather than being driven to/from school. Exploring how to harness such preferences in future advocacy and intervention work is needed. Future studies should examine the potential mediating role of parents between children׳s preference/intention to cycle and cycling behavior.},

Grade 7 and 8 students (n = 614) from twenty-one schools throughout London, Ontario, participated in a school-based travel mode survey. Geographic information systems (GIS) were employed to examine environmental characteristics of the child's mode of travel between home and school measured at the scale of the likely travel route. Logistic regression was used to assess what factors influence both the to- and from-school trip. Over 62 percent of students living within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of school walked or biked to school and 72 percent walked or biked home from school. Actively commuting to school was positively associated with shorter trips, with distance being the most important correlate. Boys were significantly more likely to use active travel modes than girls. Higher traffic volume along the route was negatively related to rates of active travel and children from higher income neighborhoods were less likely to actively travel than children from lower income neighborhoods. In terms of environmental characteristics, the presence of street trees was positively associated and higher residential densities and mixed land uses were negatively associated with active travel to school. For the journey home, crossing major streets and increased intersection density were negatively associated with active travel. The findings of this research give evidence that active travel is associated with the environmental characteristics of walking routes. This information should be considered for urban planning and school planning purposes to improve children's walking environments.},

  abstract = {Climate change is taking a toll on human health, and some leaders in the public health community have urged their colleagues to give voice to its health implications. Previous research has shown that Americans are only dimly aware of the health implications of climate change, yet the literature on issue framing suggests that providing a novel frame - such as human health - may be potentially useful in enhancing public engagement. We conducted an exploratory study in the United States of people's reactions to a public health-framed short essay on climate change. U.S. adult respondents (n = 70), stratified by six previously identified audience segments, read the essay and were asked to highlight in green or pink any portions of the essay they found "especially clear and helpful" or alternatively "especially confusing or unhelpful." Two dependent measures were created: a composite sentence-specific score based on reactions to all 18 sentences in the essay; and respondents' general reactions to the essay that were coded for valence (positive, neutral, or negative). We tested the hypothesis that five of the six audience segments would respond positively to the essay on both dependent measures. There was clear evidence that two of the five segments responded positively to the public health essay, and mixed evidence that two other responded positively. There was limited evidence that the fifth segment responded positively. Post-hoc analysis showed that five of the six segments responded more positively to information about the health benefits associated with mitigation-related policy actions than to information about the health risks of climate change. Presentations about climate change that encourage people to consider its human health relevance appear likely to provide many Americans with a useful and engaging new frame of reference. Information about the potential health benefits of specific mitigation-related policy actions appears to be particularly compelling. We believe that the public health community has an important perspective to share about climate change, a perspective that makes the problem more personally relevant, significant, and understandable to members of the public.},

Travel mode at each school was assessed by a hands-up survey and school travel plans were reviewed for content. Results Complete data were available for 53 schools. There was no increase in AST at follow-up after one year. There was variation in mode change between schools. Only season of data collection predicted a decrease in AST in the morning (B=-5.36, p{$<$}.05). Conclusion This Canadian STP evaluation showed no change in AST after one year. There was evidence of some localized success at nearly half of the participating schools. More robust monitoring and evaluation are needed to examine STP effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Objective The objective of this study was to identify facilitators and barriers to effective School Travel Planning (STP) implementation. Methods Interviews were conducted with 34 Canadian STP facilitators. Participants were interviewed regarding: i) perceptions of STP success; ii) facilitators and barriers to effective STP implementation; and iii) recommendations for improving STP. A thematic analysis was used to inductively code and categorize data units into themes. Results Participants were predominantly female, worked within the health sector, and had implemented STP in the province of Ontario. All facilitators perceived STP to be successful although definitions of 'success' varied. Factors facilitating effective implementation included the well-designed STP model, collaboration between multidisciplinary stakeholders, and the facilitators׳ leadership role. Conversely, the lack of stakeholder involvement from principals, parents, and students, was identified as a barrier to effective implementation. However, the primary factor that hindered implementation was the lack of time given by funding organizations to implement STP. To observe more effective and sustainable STP interventions in Canada, the facilitators acknowledged the pressing need for multi-level government funding to develop supporting infrastructure for AST, fund facilitators, and implement policies to foster greater AST. Conclusion Overall, STP was considered successful in a variety of ways including increased awareness, rates of AST, multidisciplinary collaborations, and school-specific strategies to overcome AST barriers. The study points to a variety of factors affecting implementation. However, there was some evidence to suggest that the existing STP model is likely a short-term 'band-aid' solution to increase AST given the lack of time and sustained funding to support its implementation. Findings further call for greater investment in resources and capacity to support AST interventions like STP, particularly at the Canadian provincial and municipal levels.},

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate a Canadian School Travel Planning (STP) intervention, by examining child, family, and school-level characteristics that are associated with mode shift from driving to AST one year post-intervention. A secondary objective was to highlight which STP strategies were deemed effective by parents of those children who switched travel modes to AST. Methods Schools (n=103) across Canada participated between January 2010 and March 2012. STP committees implemented strategies to overcome school-specific AST barriers. Mode shift and child/family demographics were assessed by a retrospective, cross-sectional parental survey (n=7827) one year after STP implementation. School level demographics were collected from school administrators. Binomial regression models were applied to examine child, family, and school-level characteristics related to mode shift from driving to AST. Results Approximately 17\% of the sample reported driving less at one-year follow-up both in the morning and afternoon periods. Among these, the majority switched to AST in the morning (n=1002) and afternoon periods (n=995). Results from the regression analyses showed that students in higher elementary grades, living less than 3km from school, attending urban and suburban schools, and attending schools situated in a medium income neighborhood were significantly more likely to change travel mode from driving to AST. Approximately 35\% of parents reported that infrastructure improvements and safety education were the most effective STP strategies. Conclusion The study findings highlight the potential of the STP process in Canada in promoting mode shift from driving to AST. The findings demonstrate STPs may be more effective in some locations where conditions are conducive to mode change. This should inform the development of STP school-selection criteria that may maximize already limited resources by recruiting schools most responsive to STP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The declining prevalence of Active School Transportation (AST) has been accompanied by a decrease in independent mobility internationally. The objective of this study was to compare family demographics and AST related perceptions of parents who let their children walk unescorted to/from school to those parents who escort (walk and drive) their children to/from school. By comparing these groups, insight was gained into how we may encourage greater AST and independent mobility in youth living in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Canada. METHODS: This study involved a cross-sectional design, using data from a self-reported questionnaire (n =1,016) that examined parental perceptions and attitudes regarding AST. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to explore the differences between households where children travelled independently to school or were escorted. RESULTS: Findings revealed that unescorted children were: significantly older, the families spoke predominantly English at home, more likely to live within one kilometer from school, and their parents agreed to a greater extent that they chose to reside in the current neighborhood in order for their child to walk to/from school. The parents of the escorted children worried significantly more about strangers and bullies approaching their child as well as the traffic volume around school. CONCLUSIONS: From both a policy and research perspective, this study highlights the value of distinguishing between mode (i.e., walking or driving) and travel independence. For policy, our findings highlight the need for planning decisions about the siting of elementary schools to include considerations of the impact of catchment size on how children get to/from school. Given the importance of age, distance, and safety issues as significant correlates of independent mobility, research and practice should focus on the development and sustainability of non-infrastructure programs that alleviate parental safety concerns.},

Thematic analysis identified four typologies (environmental context, emotions, social influences and trip factors) based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and specific themes and sub-themes underlying children's affective experiences of their journeys to school. This study is the first known to authors to attempt to adapt the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) model into AST and children's experiences and associated behavioural domains with design aspects. Such an insight into children's attitudes could inform urban planners and designers about how to apply more effective behaviour change interventions, targeting an AST increase among children.},

PA derived from active school travel may have important implications for the healthy development of children and youth. This article reviews transportation, urban planning, health and environmental psychology literatures to explore current understanding of school travel behaviour. The major theoretical approaches used to study and explain walking/cycling behaviour were examined; and existing evidence of the influences on school travel outcomes was summarized. Based on this review, the paper outlines a conceptual framework for exploring school travel behaviour of children and youth. The model hypothesizes multiple levels of influence on independent mobility and mode choice for school transportation; independent mobility is conceptualized within the household activity-travel paradigm. Future empirical research based on this framework will inform policy interventions that are focused on children's active mobility and PA.},

This occurs in part because both politicians and interest groups take an increasingly proactive approach to amplify their views of what an issue is about However, news media also play an active role in framing public policy issues. Thus, in this article, news discourse is conceived as a sociocognitive process involving all three players: sources, journalists, and audience members operating in the universe of shared culture and on the basis of socially defined roles. Framing analysis is presented as a constructivist approach to examine news discourse with the primary focus on conceptualizing news texts into empirically operationalizable dimensions\textemdash syntactical, script, thematic, and rhetorical structures\textemdash so that evidence of the news media's framing of issues in news texts may be gathered. This is considered an initial step toward analyzing the news discourse process as a whole. Finally, an extended empirical example is provided to illustrate the applications of this conceptual framework of news texts.},

  abstract = {Background: Environmental perceptions appear to play a role in determining behaviour in children, although their influence on active commuting remains unclear. This study examines whether attitudes, social support and environmental perceptions are associated with active commuting behaviour in school children and whether these associations are moderated by the distance to school. Methods: Data were collected as part of the SPEEDY study (Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people), a cross-sectional study of 2064 children from schools in Norfolk, UK. Data regarding the usual mode of travel to school, attitudes towards and social support for active commuting, perceptions of the neighbourhood and route to school were assessed using questionnaires completed by 2012 children and their parents. Distance to school was estimated using a Geographic Information System and this was used to compare associations between personal and environmental factors and active travel, across different distance categories. Results: Forty per cent of children reported usually walking to school, with 9\% cycling and the remainder using motorised travel. Parental attitudes and safety concerns, the presence of social support from parents and friends and parent-reported neighbourhood walkability were all found to be predictors of active commuting, with children receiving peer and family support and living in supportive environments being more likely to walk or cycle. There was some evidence of a moderating effect of distance whereby attitudes were more important for short distances and safety concerns long. Conclusion: Both attitudinal and environmental perceptions are associated with children's active commuting behaviours. Given the difficulty in modifying attitudes directly, the effect on them of interventions to provide more supportive environments should be evaluated.},

  abstract = {In response to anthropogenic climate change, many governments are adopting policies to reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, federal and provincial governments have implemented carbon pricing. One of the effects of putting a price on carbon is increasing the cost of using private vehicles, which may reduce mobility and increase the risk of social exclusion, especially in contexts where car dependence is high. In this article, we analyse how municipal governments in Canada frame the challenges of climate change and reducing emissions, and examine whether they link these challenges to issues of mobility and social exclusion. Focusing on policies from four of Canada's largest cities \textendash{} Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver \textendash{} we identify four main frames used in planning documents: ''the Growing City'', ''If You Build It, They Will Come'', ''Better City for All'', and ''the Resilient City''. The Growing City frame is used to support status quo urban development, with climate mitigation options (including sustainable travel modes) optionally included for more concerned residents. This is the dominant frame in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. Conversely, Vancouver uses the Resilient City frame to indicate that climate mitigation and adaption strategies are essential, and all citizens must be prepared for change. Vancouver presents changes to mobility as necessary for all, rather than an option for some. Social exclusion is not explicitly addressed in the frames, though it is presented as a reason to support building alternative transportation or more public spaces. Social exclusion receives little consideration as a potential consequence of climate mitigation policies.},

The aim of this study was to examine correlates of CIM (8-12 years old) in the Canadian context to inform future interventions. CIM was measured via parent surveys. Individual, social, and environmental correlates of CIM were examined using a social-ecological framework. 1699 participants' data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and gender-stratified linear mixed-effects models while controlling for site, area-level socioeconomic status, and type of urbanization. Individual correlates including child grade ({$\beta$} = 0.612, p {$<$} 0.001), language spoken at home ({$\beta$} = -0.503, p {$<$} 0.001), car ownership ({$\beta$} = -0.374, p {$<$} 0.05), and phone ownership ({$\beta$} = 0.593, p {$<$} 0.001) were associated with CIM. For boys, parental gender ({$\beta$} = -0.387, p {$<$} 0.01) was negatively associated with CIM. Parents' perceptions of safety and environment were significantly associated with CIM. Location (i.e., site) was significantly associated with CIM (ref: Trois-Rivieres; Ottawa ({$\beta$} = -1.188, p {$<$} 0.001); Vancouver ({$\beta$} = -1.216, p {$<$} 0.001)). Suburban environments were negatively associated with boys' independent mobility ({$\beta$} = -0.536, p {$<$} 0.05), while walkability (400 m {$\beta$} = 0.064, p {$<$} 0.05; 1600 m {$\beta$} = -0.059, p {$<$} 0.05) was significantly associated with girls' independent mobility only.

A combination of a written questionnaire, a drawing activity and focus group discussions was employed to understand firstly the nature of children׳s fun while walking to school and secondly, the neighbourhood attributes that can promote such enjoyment. The findings reveal how their interactions with nature, recreational amenities and retail spaces contributed to their enjoyment of playful, sensory, autonomous as well as social types of experiences. In accepting children׳s experiences as fundamental to the understanding of their school journeys, practitioners and academics can thereby research, create and promote environments that directly respond to children׳s needs and interests to walk to school.},

Using beta regression, we modeled the proportion of children using AST, considering built environment and social environment factors around schools.

Overall, several modifiable road design features were associated with AST, including the presence of school crossing guards, cycling infrastructure, Walk Score\textregistered{} and traffic signal density. There was variability in the directionality and statistical significance of associations with design variables across cities, suggesting that the local context and directed local interventions are important to support AST.

Parents are the key decision makers regarding school travel mode, with parents׳ perceptions of traffic safety being an important factor in the decision making process. The study examines the relationships between perceptions of traffic danger, walking to school and built environment features. Methods A cross-sectional parent survey was conducted in 2011, in 20 elementary schools in Toronto, Canada. Built environment data from municipal sources were mapped onto school attendance boundaries developed by the school board which identified household eligibility for attendance at each school. Repeated-measures logistic regression was used to examine the associations between frequent walking to school (4\textendash 5 times/weekly) and parents׳ perceptions of traffic danger along the school route and at the school site, and between perceptions of high levels of school route traffic danger and social and built environment variables. Results The response rate was 38\% with 733 surveys returned. The odds of frequent walking to school were 47\% lower with high perceived school route traffic danger, but walking was unrelated to perceived school site traffic danger. Higher perceived route danger was associated with observation of dangerous midblock crossings near schools (OR 1.97), higher flashing beacon density (OR 1.31) and lower dead-end road (OR 0.70), collector road (OR 0.80) traffic light (OR 0.80) and school crossing guard densities (OR 0.89). Conclusions High perceived school route but not school site danger, was related to frequent walking to school and to specific built environment features. Parents׳ perception of danger is not always in accordance with objective measures of traffic danger. Safe road design along school routes is important to influence traffic safety and walking to school; however, safe road design must also be directed to the immediate school environment where collision densities are high.},

Individual, parental and societal correlates had moderate positive associations with AST including: child age, lower parental education, income and other income related factors, race and positive perceptions of AST. Longitudinal studies were few in number, as were studies about exceptional populations, policy, and interventions. AST intervention should focus on key AST correlates. Social and environmental diversity calls for local solutions to school travel challenges.

Potentially risky student drop-off behaviours by private vehicle drivers are frequently observed around schools which may contribute to collision risk. A cross-sectional observational study conducted in the spring, 2015 at 100 Toronto elementary schools, examined built environment features associated with risky student drop-off and pedestrian behaviours. Observers completed a checklist to identify risky behaviour outcomes. Covariates included the proportion of children observed dropped off by private vehicles, built environment features (within 200m of schools) and school social disadvantage. Logistic regression was conducted for each outcome. The most common risky behaviours observed were dropping children at the opposite side of the road from schools (79\%) and reversing dangerously (64\%). The most common child pedestrian behaviours were crossing at uncontrolled midblock locations (85\%) and crossing between parked cars (61\%). Traffic congestion around schools was associated with double parking (OR 5.96), reversing (OR 4.14) and crossing between parked cars (OR 2.71, children). Less parking blocking crossing controls (OR 0.26) reversing (OR 0.37) uncontrolled midblock crossing (OR 0.26, children) and crossing between parked cars (OR 0.31, children) was observed where there were designated car drop-off areas. Driver texting appeared less common when crossing guards were present (OR 0.18). Greater school disadvantage was associated with uncontrolled pedestrian midblock crossings (OR 14.37, children).

Methods Between 2011 and 2012, 375 Australian school children aged 8\textendash 13 years (61\% female) were recruited into a cross-sectional study. Children׳s travel modes to school and non-school destinations, and socio-demographic information were assessed through child and parent surveys. Daily time spent in sedentary behavior and physical activity intensities was measured objectively through accelerometer counts from an Actiheart monitor worn on four consecutive days. Associations of active travel with sedentary behavior and physical activity variables were determined using linear mixed models while accounting for clustered sampling and covariates (age, sex, socio-economic factors, Actiheart wear time). Multiple imputation (MissForest method) was used to handle missing at random survey and accelerometer data in 104 (28\%) children. Results Active travel modes to non-school destinations were positively associated with children׳s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (b=0.18, p=0.01) but not with their sedentary behavior, light or total physical activity. Active travel modes to school were not associated with children׳s sedentary behavior or physical activity across intensities. No statistically significant differences by sex were detected in the observed associations. However, the positive association between active travel modes to non-school destinations and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity neared statistical significance in boys (b=0.15, p=0.07) but not in girls. Conclusions Active travel was positively associated with children׳s physical activity but not their sedentary behavior levels. Active travel to non-school destinations may have more potential to increase children׳s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity levels, than active travel to school.},

In a first step, mobility licenses and mobility data were collected with the help of travel diaries including specific information on travel accompaniment. In the second step, in-depth interviews with parents were conducted. Although the data can only provide a snapshot of the independent mobility of primary school children, this study confirms that active and independent mobility is the result of a variety of factors. The results indicate that \textendash{} besides trip distance and age \textendash the type of school (all-day/half-day primary school) is likewise relevant. Based on the parents' assessments, significant sharing of trips takes place in case travel accompaniment is unnecessary. Depending on the parents' attitudes towards AIM, we identified three ''profiles'' (Promoters, Pragmatists and Protectors). Linking these profiles to indicators of AIM reveals that different attitudes manifest themselves in children's travel patterns. The results are limited as only two schools served as sources of data and it was not possible to decouple the parental profiles from children's ages. Overall, it can be concluded that there is potential for improved active and independent mobility in children. To be effective, future campaigns need to consider parental attitudes.},

  abstract = {Introduction An increasing number of studies in transportation research have recently focused on well-being and travel satisfaction. These studies argue that satisfaction with travel is an indicator of the trip's contribution to subjective wellbeing of the traveler. Although the attention on satisfaction with travel is increasing, relatively few studies have considered satisfaction with travel of children. As children's travel is strongly linked to distance and the built environment, they would be important additional considerations to such research. Therefore, this study looks into the household, built environment and trip characteristics influencing satisfaction with travel and mood among Dutch children attending primary school. Additionally, the study considers the mediating effect of parental safety perception on satisfaction with travel and the relationship between satisfaction with travel and mood. Methods In order to study these relationships, survey data were collected in the Netherlands from 660 children (7\textendash 12 years) and their parents. The data were analyzed using a path analysis. Results Findings show that parental safety perceptions are related to the age of the child, income, perceptions of neighborhood infrastructure and social cohesion. Satisfaction with school travel is higher when parental safety perception is higher, when it is sunny, when traveling with a friend and when traveling by bike when this is the favorite transport mode. Satisfaction with travel is related to children reporting a better mood. Conclusion These insights can be used by policy makers to create safe school environments stimulating active travel, which in turn will improve satisfaction with travel, well-being and health among primary school-going children.},

  abstract = {Studies on school travelling frequently deal with active travelling that is considered important in preventing obesity. Most research has been done in low bicycle countries where walking is the main active mode. The paper presents an analysis for the Netherlands and Flanders, two European countries with high bicycle use. The study analyses two aspects of school travel behaviour: home-to-school distances and modal choice. Both are analysed for primary and secondary school students. A descriptive analysis learns that in Flanders trip lengths to primary schools are significantly larger than in the Netherlands and that the bicycle is more frequently used in the Netherlands. Analyses of influencing variables for both home-to-school distance and modal choice demonstrate that 'hard' factors that define the objective conditions for school choice (crucial for home-to-school distance) and modal choice are most influential. They regard the locations of eligible schools and the qualities of the eligible modes. Just one other factor is significant in the explanation of home-to-school distances: car ownership. On the other hand, modal choice is influenced by several other socio-cultural factors, where age of the pupil, size of the household, and car ownership are most important. Most outcomes are in line with other studies. The observed high bicycle use demonstrates that the bicycle has the potential to account for a large number of trips and can even be the dominant mode in school travelling.},

To begin, this chapter will use national travel data to paint a general picture of children's (aged 5\textendash 17) travel in Japan. Evidence related to the high levels of independent travel are then summarized. Results from a recent study will discuss the relationships between what children do during their trips and their satisfaction with their travel as a measure of psychological wellbeing. Finally, there will be discussion on previous research that has highlighted the importance of walking and independent travel for incidental social interactions as a measure of social well-being, which are occurrences that are particularly frequent in Japan. Having set the scene, the chapter will then discuss a number of reasons to help explain children's travel in Japan. This includes planning, regulations, and community solutions to support walking to school. A number of social practices that help maintain high levels of children's autonomy are discussed.},

The results for STS-C showed that traveling by school bus and walking or cycling was experienced as having a higher quality than traveling by car. Children who engaged in conversation during their journeys reported a higher quality and more positive feelings than children who were engaged in solitary activities during their journeys. A shorter journey was experienced as having a higher quality and resulting in more positive feelings.

In this chapter, we explore these two domains of wellbeing by reviewing the literature to see how the domains are operationalized, and what the empirical findings claim. One major aim is to reflect upon where research has taken us, and to identify what future research needs to focus on. Findings show that psychological measures include a large palette of measurements, for example, mood, wellbeing (sometimes operationalized as life satisfaction or happiness), travel satisfaction, independency, and confidence, which are all related to travel. Measures related to the cognitive domain can be categorized as either academic achievement or cognitive abilities, also identified as being affected by travel. Only three studies were identified as capturing the relationship between travel and both domains of wellbeing. One conclusion which we draw is that, although the findings are still somewhat anecdotal and in need of replication, researchers in this emerging field have indeed acknowledged the importance of examining the psychological and cognitive domains of wellbeing when it comes to studying children's everyday travel. We also find that the studies reviewed have applied a plethora of methods and measures, making it somewhat difficult to generalize the findings. We therefore emphasize that we must constantly ask ourselves if we are measuring the relevant factors, and if we are measuring them in a valid way.},

  abstract = {Children's school journeys have changed vastly during recent decades: More children are being driven to school in private cars instead of walking and cycling, with many who are entitled to a free school bus service still being driven. Earlier research into travel mode choice has often investigated how urban form impacts upon mode choice regarding school journeys\textemdash in particular how urban form hinders or enables the use of the active mode. This paper quantitatively explores parents' stated reasons for choosing the car and the relationship between these reasons and the decision to use the car to take their children to school. We additionally investigate the relationship between sociodemographic factors, distance, and both the stated reasons and the actual mode decision. A sample of 245 parents (194 women) of school children aged 10\textendash 15 in the County of V\"armland in Sweden were included in the study. The results of PLS-SEM show that the factor Social convenience has a direct relationship with the frequency of car use indicating that the wish to accompany the child and the convenience of car impacts on car choice. If the child is not allowed to travel independently, the parents choose the car to take him/her to school. Sociodemographic factors had a direct relationship with the stated reasons, whereby parents with a higher level of education valued safety/security less. Quite surprisingly, distance (i.e., environmental factor) did not affect car use, indicating that parents drive their children to school regardless of distance. By isolating the particular reasons for choosing the car, this paper focuses on a potentially important missing piece as regards finding out what motivates the increasing car usage in children's school journeys. An increased knowledge of what motivates the decision to take children by car is important for effective policies aimed at changing parents' inclination toward choosing the car.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity plays a fundamental role in the health and well-being of children. Walking is the most common form of physical activity and the journey to and from school provides an opportunity for children to be active every day. This study examines how child and parent perceptions of barriers to active school travel influences children's behaviour. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 48 elementary schools in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The study sample includes 1296 children (ages 9-14~years) who live within walking distance of their school, defined as 1.6~km network distance. Chi-square analysis examined differences between child and parent perceptions of barriers to active school travel. Logistic regression models examined how parent and child perceptions of barriers influence active school travel behaviour, while controlling for key intrapersonal, interpersonal, and physical environment factors. RESULTS: The results indicate that there are significant differences in how parents and children perceive barriers to active school travel. Model results find older children, children without siblings, households with no vehicles, and children who live closer to school are most likely to use active school travel. Parent perceptions of barriers are found to have a greater influence on children's active school travel behaviour than children's perceptions. Different perceptions of barriers influence active school travel to school compared to returning home from school. CONCLUSIONS: Child and parent perceptions of barriers to active school travel differ and have different impacts on children's travel behaviour. Understanding how child and parent perceptions of barriers differ can help policymakers and practitioners develop specialized interventions aimed at increasing children's use of active school travel and children's overall physical activity. Interventions used to promote active school travel should focus on safety, as well as perceptions of distance to break parental habits of routinely driving their children to school. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering both child and parent perceptions to create a safe and accessible environment to allow for an increase in active school travel behaviour among elementary school children who live within walking distance of their school.},
