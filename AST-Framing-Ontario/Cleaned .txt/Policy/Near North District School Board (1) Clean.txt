    INCLEMENT WEATHER
    Inclement weather season is once again upon us. With our northern winters
    being very unpredictable, there will be days when cancelling the school bus
    becomes necessary. It is therefore important that parents have contingency
    plans in place in advance. You should monitor weather conditions as we do.
    The NPSSTS uses all weather resources we have at our disposal, including
    Environment Canada. Should you see a weather warning from Environment
   Canada in the evening, there is a strong likelihood that buses will be cancelled
   the following day.
   When the decision is made to cancel buses, it is made with student safety in
   mind. The NPSSTS works closely with our experienced team of operators to
   make the best decision based on the information we have at hand.
   Please remember that although school buses may be cancelled, schools remain
   open. All students are encouraged to attend school using alternate
   transportation where possible. You will also be responsible for transportation
   home at the end of the day.
   Plan ahead and please visit for details of
   bus cancellations and delays.
