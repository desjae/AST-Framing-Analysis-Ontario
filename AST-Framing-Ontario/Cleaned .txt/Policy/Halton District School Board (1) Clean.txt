         - Benefits of Walking or Wheeling to School          
Schools are busy places, especially at the beginning and
end of the school day.
Help your students get started on the right foot -
encourage them to walk or bike to school when
possible. Even leaving the car a block or two and
walking the rest of the way helps.
It’s good for the environment and your health, and
teaches your child independence and community
awareness.
