Student Transportation
Transportation for Peel board students is provided by Student Transportation of Peel Region (STOPR). The
transportation policy outlines eligibility for transportation and other important information.
Parents can also visit the STOPR website and enter their address to determine if their child is eligible for busing, and
to find out the bus stop and route information.

Safety tips for students who ride the bus
Help make sure your child stays safe in and around school buses by reinforcing the following safety reminders:
Tips for riding the bus
      Take a seat as quickly as possible, put belongings under the seat and stay seated.
      Never stick anything out of the window, including part of your body.
      Don't eat snacks on the bus—if a choking incident happens, it may be difficult for the driver to help.
      Wait until the school bus stops before standing up to exit.
Tips for exiting the bus
      When getting off the bus, take two large steps away from bus. If you have to walk in front of the bus, do so at
      least three metres (10 giant steps) away from the bus.
      The driver must be able to see students exiting the bus and will give a signal when it is safe to cross. If more
      than one student is crossing in front of the bus at the same time, they should cross in single file.
      Children must never reach for something that is under the bus without the driver’s permission. Let the driver
      know that something is under the bus or wait until the bus moves out of the way.
