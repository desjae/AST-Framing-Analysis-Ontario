
Student Transportation
Transportation of students of Superior-Greenstone District School Board and our three
coterminous boards, is provided through a coterminous sharing agreement, resulting in maximum
ef ciency and cost savings.
From the agreement, the East of Thunder Bay Transportation Consortium was created to provide all
aspects of transportation, to each of the member boards, based on common policy, equal service,
and maximum safety to all students, regardless of which school or board they are from. Information
regarding the East of Thunder Bay Transportation Consortium can be found at
