       Transportation
       Active transportation is any self-propelled
       method of transportation, like walking,
       cycling, scootering, or skateboarding. The
       WCDSB supports active transportation as the
       preferred method of transportation to school
       because it is a healthy choice that has proven
       links to greater student achievement. To
       show this support, the Board of Trustees
       approved the Active Transportation Charter
       on May 16, 2011.

Active and Safe Routes to School
Workgroup
Members of WCDSB staff have been involved
in active school transportation in the form of
the innovative cross-sectional Active and Safe
Routes to School Waterloo Region workgroup
for over ten years. The workgroup discusses
methods to make active transportation an
easier choice and it also includes
representatives from the Region of Waterloo
(Public Health and Transportation Demand
Management), City of Waterloo, City of
Kitchener, City of Cambridge, Student
Transportation Services of Waterloo Region,
Waterloo Region District School Board and
the Ministry of Transportation.
School Travel Planning
The WCDSB collaborates with partners to
employ a dedicated School Travel Planner
who works with school committees to
develop comprehensive action plans that
result in more students choosing active travel
over the long term. The action plan items are
chosen by the school community to address
the unique issues of that school. A complete
School Travel Plan defines goals and details
concrete activities involving communications,
active transportation programming (like
walking buddies), Walking School Buses, and
road/sidewalk infrastructure or maintenance
improvements.
