Abstract School travel is becoming increasingly car-based and this is leading to many
environmental and health implications for children all over the world. One of several
reasons for this is that journey to school distances have increased over time. This is a trend
that has been reinforced in some countries by the adoption of so-called ‘school choice’
policies, whereby parents can apply on behalf of their child(ren) to attend any school, and
not only the school they live closest to. This paper examines the traffic and environmental
impacts of the school choice policy in England. It achieves this by analysing School
Census data from 2009 from the Department for Education. Multinomial logit modelling
and mixed multinomial logit modelling are used to illustrate the current travel behaviour of
English children in their journey to school and examine how there can be a significant
reduction in vehicle miles travelled, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption if the ‘school
choice’ policy is removed. The model shows that when school choice was replaced by a
policy where each child only travelled to their ‘nearest school’ several changes occurred in
English school travel. Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT) by motorised transport fell by 1 %
for car travel and 10 % for bus travel per day. The reduction in vehicle miles travelled
could lead to less congestion on the roads during the morning rush hour and less cars
driving near school gates. Mode choice changed in the modelled scenario. Car use fell from
32 to 22 %. Bus use fell from 12 to 7 %, whilst NMT saw a rise of 17 %. With more

Introduction
Millions of children all over the world travel to and from school daily, and an increasing
proportion of those journeys are made by car. Meanwhile the number of children actively
travelling to school is decreasing (Buliung et al. 2009; McMillan 2007). In the UK the
‘school run’ is the term to describe the traffic generated by parents driving their children to
school each morning and collecting them from school in the afternoon. It has been claimed
that the school run traffic causes congestion in residential areas, increases carbon emissions
and makes the area around schools unsafe for children as a result of increased cars parked
on side roads, cars driving fast, and dependency on car use leading to health problems
(Pike 2003).
   Whilst often providing positive benefits for individual car users, such a trend has also been
linked to a whole range of negative impacts that tend to worsen over time for society more
broadly. These include: impacts on personal health (e.g. through increased levels of obesity
as a result of reliance of car travel); on the environment (due to deteriorating air quality, and
increased CO2 emissions); and rises in traffic and congestion (Valsecchi et al. 2007).
   The reasons for these circumstances will be explored in more detail in the subsequent
sections. However, the basic premise of this paper is that one factor in the UK context that
has led to increased car use on the roads has been the introduction of an education policy
which seeks to improve standards by enabling parents to choose the school that their
children go to, instead of requiring that children attend the school nearest to their home.
   Consequently the aim of this paper is to quantify the transport-related impacts of
allowing parental choice of schools on personal travel behaviour, on traffic levels, fuel use,
and CO2 emissions, and to explore the wider implications on public policy. The next
section will review the factors affecting travel behaviour of the school run and the fol-
lowing section will provide a brief explanation of the school choice policy in practice. The
subsequent two sections will set out the data and method used. This is followed by the
presentation of results. Next, interpretations and discussions of the results are provided,
while the final section draws conclusions.
Factors affecting travel behaviour of the journey to school
Travel behaviour of parents and their children in terms of trip characteristics (i.e. mode
choice, journey length and cost) during the journey to school can be influenced by several
contributing factors. These include various area factors (e.g. income deprivation and road
density). In addition, personal factors (such as age, gender, ethnicity, income and attitudes)
as well as policy choices put in place by the national and local government affect travel
behaviour of the journey to school.
   Applying discrete choice modelling, Mu¨ller et al. (2008, p. 342) investigate area level
factors influencing pupil’s mode choice and state that ‘‘[journey] distance strongly influ-
ences the travel-to-school mode choice, because students switch from modes appropriate

for short distances like cycling to modes appropriate for longer distances like public
transport’’. Marshall et al. (2010, p. 1540) also employ a multinomial logit model and find
that when a child’s school is close to home (approximately 1 mile) the likelihood that they
will walk increases, but ‘‘the odds of walking decline rapidly at longer travel distances: for
travel distances greater than 1.6 km’’. Schwanen and Mokhtarian (2005) report that the
type of area a child lives in greatly influences their travel behaviour in which children
living in more urban areas were more likely to cycle or use public transport than those from
more rural areas. This is primarily due to the availability of public transport services, better
cycling infrastructure and shorter distances between a child’s home and their school.
    Using a discrete choice model, researchers report that household structure and parental
factors play a vital role in how children travel to school (e.g. Gliebe and Koppelman 2005;
McDonald 2008; Ahlport 2008). For instance, children are less likely to walk to school when
parents work (O’Fallon et al. 2004). Gliebe and Koppelman (2005) state that parental
employment directly influences how a child travels to school, noting that the younger a child
is, the more likely they are to be dependent on their parents to drive them. Research carried
out by McDonald (2008) highlights the significant impact a working parent had on a child’s
travel behaviour. His study reveals that the likelihood of children walking or cycling to
school decreased when their mother commuted to work, yet this was not the case for children
whose mother did not work outside the home. There was less direct impact on travel when the
child’s father worked outside the home. Ahlport (2008) adds that time management such as
their work schedule or the need to transport siblings to other schools can be some of the
barriers to allowing their children to walk or cycle to school as opposed to driving them.
    There are several personal factors that contribute to school travel (Fyhri and Hjorthol
2009; Pont et al. 2009). For instance, both age and gender are found to have a strong
influence on travel to school as independent mobility increases with age and that boys are
often more independently mobile than girls (Fyhri and Hjorthol 2009). Pont et al. (2009)
have also noted a significant relationship between a child’s ethnicity and household income
with their level of active travel. Their study justifies that this is likely to be due to a higher
income resulting in car ownership and higher car use in the household.
    The DfT (2009c) finds that age for example, can dramatically impact mode choice in
school travel. In 2008/09, for a journey of 1–2 miles to school 62 % of children under the
age of 11 used the car as their main mode of transport, whereas 62 % of children aged 11
and older walked this distance to school. For journeys over 5 miles, 69 % children aged
10 years and younger made this journey to school by car compared to only 22 % of
children aged over 11 years in Great Britain.
    Gender is also a key factor in how children travel. In 2008/09 22,000 trips by bicycle
were made by males under the age of 17, compared to 9,000 females travelling by bicycle;
while 61,000 trips were made on local buses by males under the age of 17 compared to
71,000 by females under the age of 17. These independent variables strongly influence on
how children travel to and from school.
    Policy too, can greatly affect school travel. For example, the free bus fare policy in
London allows children between the ages of 5 and 18 years to travel on all buses and trains
(both underground and over ground) at no cost with a valid ‘Oyster’ smartcard. According
to Transport for London (TfL), since introducing the free travel scheme in 2005, the
number of car journeys has fallen by 6.4 % which they claim is the equivalent to 3.3
million annual car journeys or nearly 7.5 million miles (TfL 2010). Less direct perhaps, are
the implications of policies in other sectors. One such example is the so-called ‘school
choice’ policy, whereby parents are encouraged to choose what they see to be the most
appropriate school for their children to attend.
                                                                                       123

   It can be seen from the above studies that the primary factors affecting school travel
behaviour are residential location, socio-demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender,
ethnicity) and household structure (e.g. whether parents are in employment, household
income, car ownership). This study will further investigate whether these factors have an
effect on mode choice of children travelling to school while analysing school census data
from England.
School choice policy and its impact on travel behaviour
In many countries across the world ‘school choice’ policies have been established which
allow parents to choose to send their children to any school instead of being restricted to
sending their children to the school closest to their home (O’Shaughnessy 2007; Barrow
2002). The rationale for this approach is that encouraging schools to become more diverse
and to compete with one another for students raises the quality of education provided
across the sector as a whole (Burgess et al. 2006) and proponents would argue this is what
has happened. Burgess and Briggs (2010, p. 83) state that ‘‘doing well at school is helped
by attending a good school’’ adding that originally only the children from richer back-
grounds had access to better quality schools. In England the school choice policy was
implemented from the 1980s and subsequently successive Governments of both major
parties have continued along the increased school choice path, such that as of 2009 only
42.5% of pupils attended the school closest to their home (DCSF 2009). Moreover, this
trend is set to continue (Burgess et al. 2007).
   Interestingly, over the same period GCE ‘A’-Level (i.e. the English High School
national examination) pass rates have continually improved for 27 years in a row in
England (Joint Council for Qualifications 2009) and the numbers of students applying for
further education at universities have also continued to rise in England (UCAS 2009). This
however may not necessarily be a direct result of school choice as there may be other
factors which may have contributed to this such as the development of ICT (particularly
the internet in schools) in education, improved facilities, better teacher training or more
funding invested in education. Burgess and Briggs (2010) highlight the benefits of the
school choice policy in England noting that it allows social mobility through children from
poorer families able to access to higher quality schools without being restricted by where
they live.
   The UK Government published findings in 2005 that state the school choice policy has
benefited schools across England between 1997 and 2005 by increasing funding to schools
(by £16 billion) increasing the average pass rate of exams (by 11 %) and increasing the
number of teachers in England (by 32,700). It also claims ‘‘To respond to parental demand,
we need to expand choice, create real diversity of provision, and ensure that the benefits of
choice are available to all’’ (DESF 2005, p. 20). However, there are also issues that have
arisen. Thus Burgess et al. (2005) note that school choice can also lead to too much
demand on certain schools forcing them to have to ration places.
   Burgess et al. (2005) add that originally value of homes would increase around schools
considered to be ‘high quality’ but with the introduction of school choice in some cases this
has changed. Finally, the school choice policy may lead to lesser quality schools not being
monitored or receiving the attention needed when parents can choose for their children not
to attend them. Burgess et al. (2005) suggests there needs to be regulations or standards
enforced to ensure this does not happen. Burgess and Briggs (2010) state that the policy
also opens up to parents trying to ‘work’ the system to ensure their children attend a certain

Transportation (2013) 40:69–90                                                              73
school and not necessarily following the rules as others. In England there have been some
reported incidents in which parents had temporarily rented flats, used a friend’s address or
moved in with a relative in a particular catchment area to obtain a place at a specific school
for their child (Curtis 2009).
   As a result, it is likely that the children and their parents take advantage of the school
choice policy (and so are usually not eligible for free bus travel) and that this school is
outside of practical walking and cycling distances of 1–1.5 miles (Mu¨ller et al. 2008; van
Sluijs et al. 2009) and therefore are increasing nationwide VMT and CO2 emissions.
Overall, several studies have been conducted that investigate the ‘success’ of ‘school
choice’, but one area that does not appear to have been widely explored is the impact that
the parental choice agenda has on travel patterns and the resulting impacts.
   Two exceptions to this have examined these issues in detail, both in St Paul, Minnesota.
Marshall et al. (2010) examined the effects of a school choice policy on CO2 emissions
using a multinomial logit model and determine that children travel further to school as a
result of the school choice policy. They found that parental school choice significantly
increased CO2 emissions—by between four and seven times—in the area studied and that
the number of children walking to school increased by eight times (Marshall et al. 2010).
Wilson et al. (2007) also explored this and explain that changes in children’s travel
behaviour can result in considerable transportation and cost implications including pol-
lution such as emissions. They found that in one example, if the bus was removed from
school travel, cost, distance travelled and CO2 emissions all rose by 4.5 times (Wilson et al.
2007). Therefore, as governments continue to push the school choice agenda, the time
would seem right for assessing what the wider transport-related impacts of the policy may
be as a consequence.
The school travel context in England
Before detailing the data used in this study, it is helpful to understand the current school
and transport situation in the England and UK. In brief, in England in 2009 there were over
26,000 schools teaching more than 9 million school aged children residing in England, of
which 7 million are of ‘compulsory school age’ (aged between 5 and 16 years) and are
therefore required to attend school by law (ONS 2010). Of these schools, 21,695 were
‘Government maintained’ or ‘state’ schools which are funded through the auspices of a
Local Authority (LA)—a part of local government. Specifically, LAs are responsible for
local implementation of national policies and the raising of achievement and standards in
schools (Fletcher-Campbell and Lee 2003). In total, there are 152 LAs in England which
are responsible for spending roughly 13 % (in 2010) of local authority expenditure
(Chamberlain 1980) going towards supporting pupils through help with travel to school of
‘free school meals’ in which children from poorer families are provided lunch every day at
school. There are a variety of types of schools which exist in England. Most schools are
funded by central Government. These include state or ‘grant maintained’ schools, acade-
mies (publicly funded but outside of Government control) and some publicly funded faith
or denominational schools (Department for Education (DfE) 2010). There are also private
‘independent’ schools (confusingly also called ‘public’ schools) which are usually funded
through parents paying fees. All these different types of schools normally follow the same
curriculum as ‘maintained’ schools but are not funded directly from the local Government
they are not included in the School Census and therefore are not covered by the statistics
used in this study.
                                                                                   123

74                                                                  Transportation (2013) 40:69–90
   The 1944 Education Act states that the LA has a responsibility of aiding those living
within certain distances of their nearest school (2 miles for primary school age and 3 miles
for secondary school age) in the form of free transport (Headicar 2009). This is usually in
the form of a bus pass, unless the pupil is considered to have special medical needs (SEN).
Interestingly though, if pupils do not attend to the school closest to their home, the
Education Act transport provision does not apply—an important point to note given that
some 57 % of pupils in England no longer attend their nearest school.
   The average number of trips made by walking has fallen from 292 in 1995/97 to 221 in
2008 (DfT 2009a). Car ownership has also risen from 17 % of households owning two or
more cars in 1985/86 and rising to 32 % of households owning two or more cars in 2008
(DfT 2009b). It is only to be expected that school travel has followed similar trends of car
use levels increasing whilst walking levels have fallen steadily. The Department for
Transport (DfT 2009c) examines the changes in school travel in the last decade and the
percentage change in children travelling to school and report that the number of children
walking to school reduced by 6 % between 1997 and 2009, while the number of car trips
rose by 2 % over this time. The percentage of pupils travelling to school by car notably
rose between 1998 and 2002, however the percentage of pupils travelling to school by car
has remained fairly steady in the UK between 2002 and 2009 (DfT 2009a).
   Current traffic patterns suggest that traffic congestion increases during school term (i.e.
during term time). Traffic volume in England on a normal weekday peaks between 8 a.m. and
9 a.m. in the morning and again between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. in the afternoon (DfT 2009d).
Most dramatically, at 8.45 a.m. some 18 % of the traffic on the roads is due to travel to
school. At these times traffic is nearly double the average level due to commuting and trips to
school (DfT 2009d). In 2008, there were 262 million vehicle miles travelled (VMT) by car in
the UK (only around 3.4 m miles were travelled by bus), emitting over 59 tonnes of CO2.
   Of all this travel, trips to school by children (5–18 years) in England made up 11 % of
daily personal trips. Of these, 41 % are by walking, 11 % by bus, and 45 % are made by car
(DfT 2008). The average time spent per trip to school related journeys has risen from 11 min
in 1995/99 to 13 min in 2008. The average trip length also increased in 2008 to 3.3 miles
from 2.9 miles in 1995/97. As these journey lengths increase, so does the impact on transport
related impacts such as traffic levels, fuel use, energy use and the environment.
Data used
The Department for Education (known as the Department for Children, Schools and
Families until 2010) carries out the School Census (DCSF 2009) which is a survey of
schools within the local authorities of England, and this data has been analysed for the
purpose of this study. In 2009, the survey had a total of 7,484,001 students from 22,170
Government maintained schools in England. The details of each individual child are
recorded including variables such as their main mode of travel to school, how far they
travel whether they are entitled to free school meals, the distance to their closest school and
basic personal and individual details such as age and gender. Interestingly the question
asking their main mode of travel was only introduced in 2007, and the details of distance
travelled to school was first used in 2009 to aid the Government in its school travel plan
initiative. The distance to school is generated from the postcode of the child’s to the
postcode of the child’s school (i.e. they are measured along the shortest available route
along which a child, accompanied by an adult if necessary, may walk in reasonable safety).
Only non-Government maintained schools are excluded from the survey.

school closest to their home. This suggests that a significant proportion of vehicle miles
travelled (VMT) is generated as a result of children not travelling to their closest school,
but instead travelling (usually by car) to a school further away from their home.
   For the purpose of this study, a sample of 69,910 pupils was randomly selected from the
Census population of 7,484,001 pupils. Due to the size of the dataset, an analysis for the
whole sample population was not possible due to computing power and time constraints1;
yet the random sample represents an accurate picture of the dataset as seen in the per-
centage share comparison of the pupil’s main mode of travel in Table 1.
   A random sample was taken using a simple random sampling process which means the
selection probability of each unit is the same. This was tested five times (see Table 1) to
ensure the distribution remained similar. Sample 5 was chosen for the final model. The
Census dataset presented 11 different categories of transport (see Table 1) as the pupil’s
main mode of travel. Modal shares for some of these modes are very low and given the
complexity of a choice model increases with the increase in choice alternatives (Train
2003), the 11 modes of travel have been combined into 4 mutually exclusive categories
consisting of:
• Car (including travel by car and car sharing)
• Bus (including travel by dedicated school bus and public school bus)

    The School Census data is a survey of how children travel to school. For this reason, all
references to journeys and travel only refer to the journey made by the individual child.
Any travel made by their parents after the journey to school is complete is not considered
in this study because the journey patterns or purpose of the parents is not available. As the
aim of this paper is to quantify the transport-related impacts of allowing parental choice of
schools on personal travel behaviour, traffic levels, fuel use, and CO2 emissions; the modes
of travel of walking and cycling have been combined into the category of ‘non-motorised
transport’ as neither of these modes have a cost, produce CO2 emissions or contribute
towards vehicle miles travelled. Moreover, cycle trips only constitute 1.8 % of the total
school trips.
    Table 2 outlines the variables used in this study and how they will be employed in the
modelling. The average distance to current school is 1.3 miles and this reduces to 0.6 miles
for the case of the average distance to nearest school.
    The data does not contain the exact income of each child’s household, however, if
pupils are eligible for free school meals (represented as FSM in the data) then their
household meets a Governmental criterion for being a ‘low-income household’ and so the

model will indicate a low income household from free school meal eligibility. Due to the
nature of the data, we do not know the income of the household the children live in. For
this reason the Income Deprivation Affecting Children Indices Score (IDACI) for the area
a child resides in is used as a proxy for income. The score is between 0 (0 %) and 1
(100 %). The higher the IDACI score, the more deprived an area is. However, it is
important to note that not everyone living in that area is necessarily deprived, but the
circumstances of the majority of people living in that area contribute towards the score.
   The cost of car travel was estimated through average cost of fuel per mile figures from
the AA website (AA 2011). The cost for bus travel was obtained from the annual operating
revenue per passenger journey (2009/10) on local bus services at £1.20 per vehicle mile (an
average cost for London, English metropolitan and English non-metropolitan local bus
services) which was sourced from Department for Transport Public Service Vehicle Survey
(DfT 2009d) and was used in this case as a proxy for value. The mean figure is a result of
modelling two types of bus users. Pupils who travel by dedicated school bus (DSB) are
generally assumed to not pay for their bus travel (as a result of the home-to-school
transport policy) and therefore their journey would cost the users nothing, whilst other
pupils who travel via public service buses (PSB) pay either full or subsidised fares and
have been modelled as paying £1.20. Combined these pupils give an average cost of bus of
£1.179.
   Road network data was obtained from the UK Ordnance Survey (2010), and road
density was calculated based on this road network data (to calculate total road length in an
area) and the size of the area used (i.e. Lower Layer Super Output Area, LLSOA). Road
density equals total length of roads (miles) per area (squared miles). This has been added as
proxy for land-use. Roadway density (km of road lengths per sq km of area where a pupil
resides) has been included in the paper as a proxy for the level of public transport activities
(as in areas of high road density public transport is generally assumed to be more available
and accessible). This also serves as a proxy for geographical location (i.e. urban or rural) of
the area where a pupil resides.
   For the purpose of comparisons and recommendations in the discussion, Table 3
explains the assumptions made for the purpose of this paper used to derive the impacts
from the scenario modelled from various academic and Government sources. The table is
divided into the following sections of personal mobility, vehicle miles travelled (VMT) in
England, fuel used in England and CO2 used in England.
   The DfT publishes the Road Transport Statistics of Great Britain detailing the average
travel made by people each year. The details from this have been used to determine the
personal mobility of people in England during 2009. By comparing the average personal
miles travelled with the population of England in 2009 we can determine the miles trav-
elled per person per year by car and bus. The DfT also publishes the annual National
Travel Survey of household travel in the UK every year by mode of transport and journey
purpose.
   Using this data, the details of how people of England travel can be compared to average
car and bus occupancy with the journey to school allowing VMT in England to be deter-
mined. A combination of publications from the Department of Environment, Food and
Families (DEFRA 2008) and the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT 2005) give
details of the average miles per gallon (mpg) of petrol and diesel used in cars and buses
allowing for average fuel used in England to be obtained. The Department of Energy and
Climate Change (DECC 2008) and the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI
2009) hold databases recording the average CO2 emissions resulting from road transport and
through comparison with the data above, allows for analysis of the CO2 used and emitted in
                                                                                   123

acknowledged that this is a generalisation for the purpose of this research, and that different
makes of car in reality emit different levels of CO2 as a result of different levels of fuel
consumption, different engine sizes and travelling at different speeds.
Methodology
Figure 1 presents the methodology employed to quantify the transport related impacts of
school choice in England. Data from the three different sources (i.e. the School Census
2009, the 2001 Census, and Road Network Data) were integrated using GIS.
   A discrete choice model (either a multinomial logit model or a mixed multinomial logit
model as discussed below) needs to be developed to show the relationship between mode
choice and distance travelled by children travelling to their current school while controlling

Fig. 1 Research methodology to quantify the transport related impacts of school choice
other factors such as: cost of travel, age, gender, ethnicity, proxy for household income (i.e.
eligibility for free school meals and IDACI of multiple deprivation score for the pupil’s
neighbourhood) and road density. Roadway density (km of road lengths per sq km of area
where a pupil resides) has been included in the paper as a proxy for the level of public
transport activities (as in areas of high road density public transport is generally assumed to
be more available and accessible). This also serves as a proxy for geographical location
(such as urban, rural) of the area where a pupil resides.
   The developed discrete choice model can then be used to estimate the modal share of
the sample of the census data for children travelling to their current school. The same
model can also be used to estimate the modal share of the same sample if all those children
travelled to their nearest school. This can simply be achieved by replacing ‘the distance to
the current school’ in the calibrated discrete choice model with ‘the distance to the nearest
school’. Table 4 can then be utilised to produce the differences that can be made if all
children are to travel to the nearest school as opposed to their current school. As a result,
one could quantify the transport-related impacts of allowing parental choice of schools on
personal travel behaviour, on traffic levels, fuel use and CO2 emissions. However, this does
not take into account any ‘unobserved factors’. Even if travelling to their nearest school
some children may not change their mode choice. For example, if the child’s nearest school
was en route to a parent’s workplace; it may still be seen to be more convenient to drive a
child to school even though it is within a feasible walking distance, or the drive to school
could be on the way to other destinations the parent is travelling to that day.
   This paper adopts the multinomial logit (MNL) model and mixed multinomial logit
(MMNL) model for analysing school children’s mode choice, both of which have been
widely used in modelling nominal response data. The MNL model can be written as (Long
and Freese 2006):

vector of pupil specific coefficients for the effects on mode j relative to the base mode. In
this paper, the ‘‘car’’ is used as a base mode choice.
    The standard MNL model has the assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives
(IIA). IIA effectively assumes that the choices (e.g. car, bus, NMT and OPT) for a child are
independent to each other. If this assumption is violated the model estimation results may
be biased (e.g. Long and Freese 2006). Moreover, the MNL model does not recognise taste
heterogeneity in parameters. Therefore, a mixed logit model which can accommodate
complex patterns of correlation among alternatives transport modes and unobserved taste
heterogeneity among pupils (Train 2003), is employed in this research. It is able to
simultaneously address a range of issues (Hensher and Button 2008). The mixed logit
model can be expressed as follows:
                            Z                      
                                   exp bj Xi þ czij

                                 m¼1 expðbm Xi þ czim Þ
where f(b) is a density function.
    Some parameters of the vector b may be fixed or randomly distributed. The standard
MNL model is a special case of the mixed logit model when b are fixed parameters. For
random parameters, the coefficients b are allowed to vary over different pupils and
assumed randomly distributed. In this paper the random coefficients are specified to be
normally distributed, e.g. b1  N ðb; W Þ where b is the mean and W is the variance. Sim-
ilarly, c may also be specified as random parameters. A parameter is determined as random
if the estimated standard deviation (SD) is statistically significant. Similarly some
parameters of c could also be considered as random.
    Based on the estimated model, predictions for each pupil using different transport mode
can be obtained. Market share for each of the four transport modes can be calculated using
the following equation:
                                                 1X N
                                        S^ð jÞ ¼       Pij
                                                 N i¼1
where S^ð jÞ is the predicted share of transport mode j; N represents the number of pupils
modelled; and Pij is the predicted probability of pupil i choosing mode j.
Results and discussion
As discussed in the methodology, transport related impacts of school choice can be
quantified by developing a discrete choice model for the prediction of modal share of
pupils travelling to their current and nearest schools. Pupils are assumed to have the choice
of four transport modes for travelling from home to school. MNL and MMNL models have
been employed to develop a mode choice model. The dependent variable is mode choice of
pupils travelling to school (car, bus, NMT and other public transport). Results from the
MNL and MMNL models are presented in Table 4. Cost was calculated as ‘alternative
specific’ but employed in the model as ‘generic’ as economists normally treat money as
fungible: a pound (£1) is a pound irrespective to transport modes, no matter where it comes
from. Cost could also be employed as ‘mode-specific’ to capture underlying preferences.
However, alternative specific constants (ASCs) may capture such preferences in the case
for the ‘generic’ cost model. Moreover, mode-specific cost variables may increase the level

of complexity in estimating the model. Distance which is related to travel time was used as
mode-specific. If the marginal cost of using a car to drive a child to school is (nearly) zero,
then the cost of car travel should be recorded as zero, instead of something we calculated
based on distance. However since we do not know whether this is the case (e.g. if the
child’s school is just on the way to parent’s work place) nor any information on this, cost of
car travel is calculated based on distance.
    All models are estimated such that the car mode is the reference case and therefore
coefficients are interpreted relative to choosing to travel by a car. While the MNL and
MMNL models provide similar results in terms of the signs of the coefficients although the
values are somewhat different. As expected, cost was found to be a disincentive. The
MMNL model outperforms the MNL model significantly in terms of model goodness-of-
fit. The pseudo R square of the MMNL model (0.47) is larger than the pseudo R-square of
the MNL model (0.45). A likelihood ratio (LR) test has also been performed to compare
the MNL and the MMNL models, and the result indicates that the inclusion of the random
parameters (i.e. ‘generic’ cost and distance related to NMT) in the MMNL model sig-
nificantly improves the model fit. Among the variables included in the model, both distance
(associated with NMT) and cost can be considered as factors reflecting the individual
perception and heterogeneity. For instance, some pupils are willing to travel longer dis-
tances by foot as their parents are more aware of benefits associated with health with
walking. The perception of costs among pupils also greatly varies and the MMNL is able to
pick up the fact that the impact of costs on mode choice is ‘random’ rather than ‘fixed’.
    Literature suggests that the mode choices made by pupils may change significantly as
the children grow older, and in particular when they change from primary school to
secondary school (Hillman 1993; Fyhri and Hjorthol 2009). In order to see whether this is
the case in England, the whole sample (69,910 pupils) was divided into two parts: (1) all
school children aged 10 or under (i.e. primary school) resulting in a sample size of 32,907
and (2) all pupils aged over 10 (i.e. secondary and Post 16) resulting in 37,003. The same
mixed multinomial logit (MMNL) model has been re-estimated for these two separate age
groups. Results are presented in Table 5. For completeness, the results of the original
MMNL model (Table 4) are also reproduced in Table 5.
    As we can see, MMNL results for two age groups differ to each other in terms of their
parameter estimates and t-statistics. Generally results for pupils aged over 10 seem to be
more consistent with MMNL model for whole population, compared to pupils aged 10 and
under. For instance, distance is all negative and significant in Table 4, but this is not the
case for pupils aged 10 or under (distance associated with OPT was positive but insig-
nificant). This result appears to suggest that pupils in different age groups act differently in
terms of transport mode choice.
    As with the MNL model, the MMNL model is also a non-linear model, therefore to
better understand the impact of distance on pupils’ mode choice, the predicted probabilities
of different transport modes are plotted against distance in Figure 2 (for a pupil aged 8,
white male, without free school meal, IDACI score = 0.5, roadway density = 15). It is
interesting to note that there is a notable inverted U-shaped relationship between distance
travelled and the probability of travelling to school by car. As the figure shows, the
probability of travelling by car increases if the distance is within 3.5 km, but decreases
when distance is above 3.5 km.
    As for age, as model 1 in Table 5 shows, the coefficients are all significant and positive
for bus, NMT and OPT, suggesting that with age increasing, pupils are less likely to travel
by car. This may be because as pupils’ age increase, parents are more confident that their
children can travel by public transport, walk or cycle safely.

   The coefficients of gender are statistically significant and negative in the bus, NMT and
OPT functions. This means that female pupils however, are less likely to travel by public
transport or NMT compared to male pupils.
   Free school meal eligibility, which is thought of as a good proxy for low income
families, also plays an important role in pupils’ mode choice. As can be seen, those who
receive free school meals are more likely to use public transport or NMT relative to car.
Similar effects have been found for IDACI Score. Increases in IDACI score increase the
probability of choosing public transport or NMT for travelling to schools.
   As for ethnicity groups, the coefficients of Asian and Chinese pupils are all statistically
significant and negative, apart from the coefficient of Chinese for OPT which is insignificant.
This implies that, compared to white pupils, Asian and Chinese pupils are more likely to
travel by car relative to public transport and NMT. Black, Mixed and other ethnicity groups
generally tend to use more public transport and NMT compared to white pupils. An
exception is that the mixed ethnic group appear less likely to travel by NMT relative to car.
   The coefficient of roadway density was found to be statistically significant and positive
for bus, NMT and OPT, meaning that pupils are more inclined to travel by public transport
or NMT compared to car at places where road density is high. Higher roadway density may
indicate better public transport and facilities (e.g. bicycle lanes), which may encourage
pupils to use bus and NMT.
   Based on the model estimation results shown in Table 5 and the assumptions presented
in Table 3, it is possible to calculate the expected market share of different transport
modes. The predicted market share of different transport modes for two scenarios are
therefore calculated: (1) pupils going to the current school; (2) pupils going to the nearest
school.

    Calculations were performed to determine the effect of school choice, and how trav-
elling to a school other than the school closest to home, could lead to changes in VMT,
CO2 and fuel consumption.
    The models calculated the average distance travelled by pupils by mode and also the
modal share of each of the four mode choices. A spreadsheet model was constructed which
was used to calculate the results of Table 6 by working out the impacts of travel based on
the model share and average distance travelled to school for nearest and current school.
The results suggest that if children travelled to their nearest school, instead of the school of
their choice the transport-related benefits would be dramatic. Impacts were calculated by
considering all pupils in England (7.48 million pupils), pupils aged 10 or under (4.19
million pupils) and pupils over 10 (3.29 million pupils).
    Tables 6 shows the differences in modal share, VMT, fuel use and CO2 emissions of
children travelled to their current school compared to the modelled scenario of what these
figures would be if all children travelled to their nearest school. As can be seen, there
would be a marked difference in daily travel in England if all school children travelled to
their nearest school as opposed to their current school. Mode choice changes in the
modelled scenario to children travelling less by car and more by sustainable modes. The
model shows that car use would fall from 32 % modal share to 22 %. The modal share for
bus would also fall from around 12 to 7 %. However, NMT through walking and cycling
would rise from around 54 to 71 %. The model suggests that if all children travelled to the
school nearest to their home, the total car miles travelled would fall by 1.1 % and the total
bus miles travelled would reduce by 10.8 %.
    It can be seen from Table 6 that the model has simulated the travel changes for both age
groups in comparison to the full dataset sample. The changes in model share for car for
younger pupils is double that for older pupils. It is also evident in the summary statistics
that younger children travel by car more than older pupils. As a result, miles travelled by
bus and other public transport and changes in modal share are much higher for older pupils
than for the younger pupils.
    There are subtle differences between pupils of primary school age and secondary school
age. For instance, younger pupils are much more car reliant than older pupils, but those
aged over 10 have higher levels of bus usage than younger pupils. However, in both cases,
when the school choice policy is removed in both age groups motorised transport falls and
travel to school by non-motorised travel significantly rises.
    Clearly there are strong reasons for allowing parents to choose the schools to which they
send their children. As Burgess et al. (2007) have noted the school choice policy has greatly
benefitted the English education system and created more accessibility to better education
regardless of IDACI. Nevertheless, there are serious (presumably unintended) consequences
on other areas of public policy, such as the impacts increased amounts of travel and longer
journey distances have on the environment (as already noted). In addition, there are also
wider implications such as longer distances impacting on mode choice. Wilson et al. (2010,
p. 2181) state that ‘‘school choice substantially influences school commuting travel
behaviour, mainly by increasing travel distance’’ suggesting that the school choice policy is
largely responsible for children travelling further to school. This could threaten the health of
children due to the reduction in so-called ‘active travel’. In addition, poorer parents are less
able to exploit the available opportunities because they are less likely to own a car and/or
have less money to send their children longer distances by public transport. There needs to
be more research done to examine potential ways of keeping good quality schools accessible
to all children, but also not promoting a policy which encourages children to have to travel
further each day and usually in an unsustainable way.

    Secondly, there are implications for other sectors too—the location for health care
facilities being one. Thus, trends in the UK towards offering patients the choice of where
they can be treated within a health ‘marketplace’ may deliver more comprehensive and
cost effective medical treatments but once again impact on the ability of (often the most
vulnerable) patients and visitors to access them. Similar issues may also apply to other
facilities where user choices are broadened (either as a result of policy or market decisions)
such as supermarkets, airports, universities, and employment centres generally.
    Implications for the model include sample size. Further research would require larger
datasets being modelled to identify more trends and changes in travel. In addition if similar
data was available for other countries which allow school choice such as the US, inter-
national studies would allow for further comparisons to take place to see how much VMT
and CO2 could be reduced around the world. Additional factors to enhance the current
model would include school performance indicators as these may play a vital role in why
parents choose certain schools over others. Ideally, knowing each pupil’s postcode would

Conclusion
The aim of this paper was to quantify the transport-related impacts of allowing parental
choice of schools on personal travel behaviour, on traffic levels, fuel use and carbon
dioxide emissions and to explore the wider implications on public policy.
    The model shows that when school choice was replaced by a policy where each child
only travelled to their ‘nearest school’ several changes occurred in English school travel.
The results suggest that VMT by car would fall by 1 % and VMT by bus would fall by
10 % per day. The reduction in VMT could lead to less congestion on the roads during the
morning rush hour and less cars driving near school gates. Mode choice changed in the
modelled scenario. Modal share for car use fell from 32 to 22 %. Bus use fell from 12 to
7 %, whilst NMT saw a rise of 17 %. With more children travelling to school by walking
or cycling the current epidemic of childhood obesity could also be reduced through active
travel. As well as being a healthier option for children, the reduction in car use could also
mean CO2 emissions would fall by 0.78 % or the equivalent of 2,500 tonnes per day in
England alone. This could result in an annual saving of over a million tonnes of fuel used
in England as a result of school travel. This supports the US findings of Marshall et al.
(2010) and Wilson et al. (2010) that a change in the school choice policy can have
significant benefits from a transport and environment view, as walking increases whilst
travel by car and bus decrease on a small scale. The findings of this paper build on this to
show the results at a national scale with larger population.
    This paper illustrates some of the impacts the school choice policy has in England. It
needs to be noted that not all behaviour would change if the policy was changed and all
children travelled to their nearest school. The main limitation of this research is the
inability to fully predict travel behaviour by taking into account personal preference as well
as personal factors which influence choice. Some children would still choose to travel by
car, yet the impacts are still very significant. If this research were to be applied at either a
UK wide or even global basis, the impacts of changes in daily travel as a result of the
school choice policy could lead to Governments revising whether the educational benefits
outweigh the environmental impacts. With regards to the dataset, as the Census only
focuses on the child’s travel behaviour other travel factors, particularly regarding parental
travel behaviour, cannot be included in the analysis (i.e. trip chaining, employment status,
car ownership). Even though this limitation restricts the potential analysis, the data still
gives a useful insight into how children travel to school each day and the personal factors
which may influence their travel mode choice.
    The wider implications for policy are that whilst diversity is encouraged through school
choice, it brings many negative side effects through transport, health and the environment.
If parents continue to allow their children to travel to school by car, these figures are only
likely to rise as the population grows. The school choice policy is not the only factor
affecting children’s travel, but as this study shows it does have a strong influence.
