Neighborhood walkability and objectively measured active
transportation among 10–13 year olds
ABSTRACT
Current active transportation literature within children is based almost exclusively on questionnaire measures of the trip to school. This literature suggests that the walkability of the built
environment can in<U+FB02>uence active transportation to school. The purpose of this study was to use
objective measures to examine the relationship between neighborhood walkability and children's
active transportation to school and other destinations. This was a cross-sectional study of 367children and early adolescents (aged 10–13 years) from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Participantswore a Garmin Forerunner 220 GPS watch during waking hours for seven consecutive days.Personal Activity Measurement Location System (PALMS) software used the GPS data to identifytrips, and for each trip the time spent in that trip and the trip modality (active or passive). GISmeasures of connectivity, proximity to destinations, and pedestrian infrastructure and safetywere used to create a walkability index. Participants living in the neighborhoods with the highestwalkability quartile spent an average of 16.2 min/day (95% CI: 11.8, 22.4) in active transportation while those in the lowest walkability quartile spent an average of 7.1 min/day (95% CI:5.0, 10.4) in active transportation. Consistent patterns between walkability and active transportation were observed in age, sex, and season of study subgroups. An increase in activetransportation minutes was seen across walkability quartiles for all of the most common activetravel destinations (i.e., home, school, other people's homes). In conclusion, in this study of10–13 year olds, those living in the most walkable neighborhoods accumulated more than twiceas much active transportation than those living in the least walkable neighborhoods.
1. Introduction
     Active transportation is one way that children can incorporate moderate-to-vigorous physical activity into their daily lives
(Faulkner et al., 2009). Children who walk and bicycle to school have higher overall physical activity (Larouche et al., 2014; van
Sluijs et al., 2009), better cardiorespiratory <U+FB01>tness (Larouche et al., 2014), and healthier waistlines (Pizarro et al., 2013). In Canada,
25% of school-aged children and adolescents report using active transportation as their main mode of transportation to school
(Barnes et al., 2016). This number varies worldwide from 79% in the Netherlands (Burghard et al., 2016) to 13% in the United States
(Katzmarzyk et al., 2016).
     Research on active transportation to school suggests that this behavior can be in<U+FB02>uenced by the built environment, which consists
of the man made surroundings that provide the setting for human activity (Larouche et al., 2014; D'Haese et al., 2015; Wong et al.,
2011). Built environment factors associated with increased active transportation to school include measures of walkability such as
how well the streets connect to each other (Dill, 2004; Giles-Corti et al., 2011), having a variety of destinations within walking
distance (Sallis and Glanz, 2006), and the presence of safety features such as tra<U+FB03>c calming measures (e.g., speed humps, 4-way-stop
intersections) and pedestrian infrastructure (e.g., crosswalks, sidewalks) (Wong et al., 2011). These walkability features can be
examined individually or summed to create a walkability index (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Frank et al., 2010; D'Haese et al., 2014;
Carlson et al., 2015).
    Although some research on non-school destinations exists (Carlson et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2016), the pediatric active transportation literature is based almost exclusively on questionnaire measures of the trip to school (Dill, 2004). The lack of insight into
determinants of travel behaviors outside of the trip to school is a recognized gap in the active transportation literature (Barnes et al.,
2016; D'Haese et al., 2015). Furthermore, the self- or parental-reported nature of the school travel mode data are likely subject to
measurement bias, a widely recognized issue in the physical activity <U+FB01>eld (Adamo et al., 2009), resulting in under or over reporting of
the observed associations between the built environment and active transportation. We are only aware of two walkability studies of
children that used objective measures of active travel (Carlson et al., 2015; Helbich et al., 2016).
    The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood walkability and objectively measured total
active transportation and active transportation to common travel destinations among 10–13 year olds.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Study participants
    The study sample consisted of a cross-sectional sample of 10–13 year olds from Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Children were excluded if they were not ambulatory or English or French speaking. A sample of 230 boys and 228 girls were recruited from the
approximately 5000 children aged 10–13 who live in Kingston. The 21 participants who lived on agricultural properties or on
highways or county roads in rural areas were excluded for the analyses for this study because these areas do not re<U+FB02>ect the built
environment this study intended to capture. Participants’ data were collected between January 2015 and December 2016. Because
physical activity levels vary by season, enrollment was balanced across the four seasons. Participants were recruited within each of
the city's 12 electoral districts in proportion to the population of 10–14 year olds in each electrical district. The economic, social and
physical attributes are similar within each electoral district but vary considerably across districts. To recruit participants, we used a
comprehensive program with overlapping strategies including word of mouth, social medial advertisements, distribution of study
postcards (at schools, day camps, youth organizations), and posting of study materials (at libraries, community centers, stores).
Participants and a parent/guardian provided written informed consent prior to participation and children were compensated $40 for
completing the study. The study was approved by the General Research Ethics Board at Queen's University.
2.2. Walkability
    City of Kingston and DMTI Spatial Inc. (Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada) geospatial databases were used in ArcGIS software
version 10.4 (ESRI, Redlands, California, USA) to obtain all GIS measures in the home neighborhoods of all participants, with the
exception of the Walk Score® (Walk Score, Seattle, Washington, USA), which was determined using the publicly accessible Walk
Score® application (https://www.walkscore.com/). ArcGIS was used to create a 1 km road network bu<U+FB00>er around each participant's
home address to de<U+FB01>ne their home neighborhood. This bu<U+FB00>er size and type has been identi<U+FB01>ed as the best <U+FB01>t when measuring youth
travel environments in Canada (Seliske et al., 2013, 2012). One kilometer corresponds to a ~ 10–15 min walk or ~5 min bicycle ride
(Seliske et al., 2012). As described below, within each participant's home neighborhood bu<U+FB00>er several measures of connectivity,
proximity to destinations, and pedestrian infrastructure and safety were determined. These measures were chosen based on previous
<U+FB01>ndings showing an association with children's active transportation (D'Haese et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2011). First, connectivity,
proximity to destinations, and pedestrian infrastructure and safety indexes were calculated. They were determined by creating a
percentile rank of the individual measures discussed in the following paragraphs. The percentile ranks were then averaged and
ranked to create the individual indexes. Finally, an overall walkability index was created by averaging the connectivity, proximity,
and pedestrian safety and infrastructure indexes. Our decision to create the walkability index using an overall average wherein the
connectivity, proximity, and pedestrian safety and infrastructure indexes were weighted equally was based on preliminary analyses
which demonstrated that these indexes had similar e<U+FB00>ects on active transportation levels.
    The measures of connectivity included: length of roads (Panter et al., 2010), intersection density (i.e., number of intersections per
km2 of land area) (Carlson et al., 2015; Dill, 2004; Mecredy et al., 2011), average block length (i.e., length of roads/number of true
intersections) (Dill, 2004; Mecredy et al., 2011) and connected node ratio (i.e., ratio of intersections to all nodes including cul-de-sacs)(Mecredy et al., 2011; Gropp et al., 2012).
    The measures of proximity to destinations included the Walk Score® (Carr et al., 2011), distance to school (Wong et al., 2011), and
population density per square km of land area (Braza et al., 2004). These measures were chosen as they re<U+FB02>ect both proximity to and
a variety of destinations within the neighborhood. The Walk Score® has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of estimating
access to walkable amenities and it is strongly correlated with residential density (r = 0.76, p < 0.001) (Carr et al., 2011). The Walk
Score® is, in part, determined by proximity to the closest school; however, in our sample the closest school was often not the school
the participants attended. Therefore, we also measured the road network distance to their school. Proximity to destinations is a strong
predictor of a children's active transportation to school and other destinations (Wong et al., 2011; Duncan et al., 2016).
    The measures of pedestrian safety and infrastructure included the total length of sidewalks and paths (Kerr et al., 2006), estimated
tra<U+FB03>c volume (Giles-Corti et al., 2011), and the density of tra<U+FB03>c calming measures (Rothman et al., 2014). Tra<U+FB03>c volume was
estimated by multiplying the length of arterial, collector and local roads by the average tra<U+FB03>c volume of these roads types in
Kingston, adding them together, and dividing by the total length of roads. Tra<U+FB03>c calming measures included speed humps (Dessing
et al., 2016), low speed zones (i.e., = 40 km/h) including school zones, crosswalks (Rothman et al., 2014), 4-way-stop signs,
playground/children playing signs, and pedestrian walking signs.
2.3. Active transportation
    Participants were provided with verbal and written instructions on how to wear a Garmin Forerunner 220 Global Positioning
System (GPS) watch (Garmin Ltd., Scha<U+FB00>hausen, Switzerland) and how to charge the watch overnight. They were then asked to wear
the watch for 7 consecutive days. They were instructed to put on the watch shortly after waking, to turn on the GPS logger function,
and to continue wearing the watch until bedtime, at which time they charged the watch so it could be used the next day. The watch
continuously recorded their longitude and latitude coordinates during waking hours.
    After the GPS data were collected, they were downloaded from the watch using Garmin Connect software (Garmin Ltd.,
Scha<U+FB00>hausen, Switzerland). The data were then exported to the Personal Activity and Location Measurement System (PALMS)
software (Carlson et al., 2015). PALMS identi<U+FB01>ed trips based on sequential GPS points that spanned = 100 m with a speed = 1 km/h
lasting at least 3 min. The software allowed for pauses in travel of up to 3 min to account for tra<U+FB03>c lights and other brief stops. After
trips were identi<U+FB01>ed, PALMS classi<U+FB01>ed the travel modality of each trip as vehicle, bicycle, or walking based on travel speed. Trips
with a 90th percentile of speed = 25 km/h were classi<U+FB01>ed as vehicle trips, trips with a 90th percentile of speed = 10 km/h
and < 25 km/h were classi<U+FB01>ed as bicycle trips, and trips with a 90th percentile of speed = 1 km/h and < 10 km/h were classi<U+FB01>ed as
walking trips. PALMS has been validated as a method for processing GPS data to objectively measure time spent in di<U+FB00>erent
transportation modes (Carlson et al., 2015). In comparison with a SenseCam (i.e., a camera worn around the neck that takes multiple
images every minute), PALMS algorithms had a mean accuracy of greater than 85% and Intraclass Correlation Coe<U+FB03>cients of greater
than .80 for classifying min/day in each trip mode.
    After the PALMS software identi<U+FB01>ed the trips and modality of each trip, we used Google Fusion Tables software (Google,
Mountain View, California, USA) to visually inspect each trip, to remove false positive trips, and identify the starting point and
destination of each trip. The false positive trips represent trips identi<U+FB01>ed by PALMS that re<U+FB02>ect other movements such as outdoor play
in the school yard. We used Google Fusion Tables to view each trip identi<U+FB01>ed by PALMS individually as GPS <U+FB01>xes on a map. Trips that
were identi<U+FB01>ed by PALMS that occurred solely within a speci<U+FB01>c location (e.g., the school yard at recess) were considered false
positive trips and were manually deleted during data cleaning; 6595 trips were deleted in this process.
    During the cleaning process, the destination of each trip was determined by examining the end of each trip using Google satellite
view and Google street view (Google, Mountain View, California, USA). Trip destinations were placed into one of the following
categories: participant's home, other people's homes, bus stop, parks or greenspace, recreation facilities, retail, food service, school,
and other. Note that only trips to school in the morning were categorized in the trip to school category. Trips leaving school in the
afternoon at the end of the school day were captured in the home destination or wherever the participant travelled immediately after
school. In addition, trips to school during the day (i.e., <U+FB01>eld trips or leaving the school property at lunch) and in the evening (i.e.,
returning for an event) were categorized separately. This was done to be able to di<U+FB00>erentiate between the primary journey to school
and other school related trips.
    During the data cleaning we noted that some of the trips that were identi<U+FB01>ed by PALMS had the exact same starting point and
destination without a pause point in the trip, such as hikes on a recreational trail (where the start and end points were a trailhead) or
going for a walk around the neighborhood (where the start and end points were the participant's home). Since these trips did not
appear to re<U+FB02>ect travel to a speci<U+FB01>c destination, we considered these to be examples of walking or bicycling for leisure and not active
transportation. Therefore, trips that were identi<U+FB01>ed by PALMS that had the same starting and end points were recoded as leisure-time
activities during the data cleaning and they did not count towards the time spent in active transportation.
    The <U+FB01>nal issue we corrected for during the data cleaning was multimodal trips. In some cases, the multimodal trips were identi<U+FB01>ed
as two separate trips by PALMS, particularly if there was a pause of > 3 min between travel modes. For example, if a participant
walked from their home to a bus stop, waited for the bus to arrive, and then took the bus to school, PALMS would have identi<U+FB01>ed two
separate trips, the <U+FB01>rst a walking trip and the second a vehicle trip. In other cases, particularly if there was not a pause of > 3 min
between trip modalities, PALMS would have identi<U+FB01>ed multimodal trips a single trip. For example, if a participant took a bus from
school to their bus stop and then walked from the bus stop to their home, PALMS would have identi<U+FB01>ed that as a single trip. When this
occurred, we manually reclassi<U+FB01>ed the single trip into multiple trips during the data cleaning process, and ensured that the modality
of each of these multiple trips was correctly classi<U+FB01>ed based on travel speed.
    After the data cleaning was completed, the data were imported into SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina, USA) for further processing and to calculate the average number of min/day of active transportation. During this process we
deleted data from days with < 10 h of GPS data (e.g., invalid days) and participants with < 4 days with 10 h of GPS data. This step is
consistent with data processing done with accelerometer measures of physical activity (Colley et al., 2010). Seventy (15%) participants were lost during this data processing step. The SAS program then determined the total number of trips, the total duration of
each trip (based on the times that the GPS points of the trip start and end points were recorded), and total daily time spent in trips
separately by trip modality and destination. The average min/day of time spent in active transportation was then calculated for each
participant and this was the outcome variable for the statistical analyses.
    The reliability of the protocol used to clean and process the GPS data and identify trip destinations was determined by repeating
all data cleaning and processing steps for the GPS data collected in week 2 for these same participants. The intra-rater reliability was
carried out by having the same individual clean the data twice separated by six months. The inter-rater reliability was determined by
having a second individual clean the data. Mean daily active transportation times were consistent across all three cleaning scenarios:
14.8 (95% CI: 12.3, 17.3) min for the initial cleaning by observer 1, 15.9 (95% CI: 13.5, 18.3) for the second cleaning by observer 1,
and 14.7 (95% CI: 12.7, 16.8) for the clean by the second observer. Intra-rater percent agreement for destinations was 90% and inter-rater agreement was 88%.
2.4. Sociodemographic and covariate data
    Sociodemographic characteristics including age, sex, and race (white or non-white including mixed race) of the participant,
family structure (single or dual parent home, number of siblings in the home), annual family income (= $50,000; $50,001-
$100,000; > $100,000), and parent education (high school or less, 2-year college, or 4-year college/university) were considered.
Season of participation was categorized based on equinox and solstice dates. Height and weight were measured, the body mass index
(BMI) was calculated, and the World Health Organization BMI growth references were used to categorize participants as having a
non-overweight (thin + normal), overweight, or obese BMI (de Onis et al., 2007).
2.5. Statistical analysis
    Data were analysed using SAS 9.4 statistical software. Multivariate analyses were conducted to compare average daily minutes of
active transportation across walkability index quartiles. Eleven percent of participants did not have any active transportation trips
and the active transportation data could not be transformed to follow a normal distribution. Therefore, a two-part modelling strategy
was used to estimate average min/day of active transportation. This is a strategy commonly used for health-care cost data which is
similarly distributed (Diehr et al., 1999; Janssen et al., 2009). In the <U+FB01>rst part, logistic regression was used to model the probability of
the presence of any active transportation minutes according to walkability index. In the second part, a generalized linear model was
used to model the relationship between the walkability index and min/day of active transportation. To <U+FB01>t this model the proc genmod
procedure was used with a logarithmic link function and gamma distribution since the data were right skewed. Both the logistic
regression and generalized linear models were adjusted for age, sex and season. The other covariates were entered in these two
models using backwards selection methods, and these covariates were retained in both of the models if they were signi<U+FB01>cantly
(p < 0.05) related to the active transportation in either the logistic regression or generalized linear model. The mean min/day of
active transportation for each quartile of the walkability index was calculated by multiplying the estimates from the two models
together. Ninety-<U+FB01>ve percent con<U+FB01>dence intervals (CI) for the means were calculated. ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc comparison
tests were used to compare active transportation by age, sex, season, and destination across walkability quartiles.
3. Results
    Characteristics of the 367 participants included in the <U+FB01>nal analyses are in Table 1. By design, half were boys (50%) and participants were evenly distributed across ages and seasons. The majority were white (86%) and lived in a dual parent household
(86%).
    The mean time spent in active transportation was 11.8 min/day (95% CI: 8.6, 16.2). Table 2 presents the mean active transportation for the di<U+FB00>erent walkability quartiles after adjusting for covariates. The e<U+FB00>ect estimates for the covariates that ended up
being included in the model are in the Supplementary <U+FB01>le table. There was a signi<U+FB01>cant linear trend in active transportation across
the walkability index quartiles (ptrend < 0.001). Overall, those living in the neighborhoods with the highest walkability scores spent
an average of 16.2 min/day (95% CI: 11.8, 22.4) in active transportation while those in the lowest walkability index quartile spent an
average of 7.1 min/day (95% CI: 5.0, 10.4) in active transportation. Consistent patterns between walkability and active transportation were observed in age, sex, and season of study subgroups (Table 2). Furthermore, the patterns of relationships were consistent
when the connectivity, proximity to destinations, and pedestrian safety and infrastructure indexes were examined on their own
(Table 3). This is despite the fact that some of these indexes were only moderately correlated with each other (Table 4).
    Home, school and other people's homes were the three most common active transportation destinations. Mean minutes of daily
active transportation were 4.1 min/day (95% CI: 2.9, 5.8) to home, 2.3 min/day (95% CI: 1.7, 3.1) to school, and 1.1 min/day (95%
CI: 0.7, 1.7) to other people's homes. An increase in active transportation minutes was seen across walkability indexes for each of
these destinations (Table 5) with signi<U+FB01>cant linear trends (ptrend < .0001) for each. The average for all other travel destinations
was < 1 min/day and we did not examine the relationship between walkability and time spent travelling to these uncommon destinations.
4. Discussion
    This study examined the relationship between neighborhood walkability and objectively measured total active transportation and
active transportation to speci<U+FB01>c destinations (home, school and other people's homes) among a sample of 10–13 year olds. The key
<U+FB01>nding of the study is that children living in the most walkable neighborhoods (highest quartile) engaged in almost 3 times more
active transportation than children living in the least walkable neighborhoods (lowest quartile). Walkability was associated with
active transportation irrespective of age, sex, season, travel destination, and type of walkability construct.
    These results add to the current body of evidence that links both objective (Carlson et al., 2015) and subjective (Giles-Corti et al.,
2011; Helbich et al., 2016; Kerr et al., 2006; Christiansen et al., 2016) walkability indexes to measures of active transportation. Most
notably, Carlson et al. Carlson et al., (2015) used objective measures of both the built environment and active transportation in a
small sample (n = 126) of 12–16 year old Americans and found that adolescents living in highly walkable neighborhoods had almost
twice as many minutes of walking and bicycling by comparison to those living in the least walkable neighborhoods. Studies that have
used subjective reports of active transportation to examine its association with walkability have seen both positive (Oliver et al.,
2016; Kerr et al., 2006; Christiansen et al., 2016) and null (Giles-Corti et al., 2011) results. These null results may be due to the fact
that the study considered measures of the school built environment rather than the children's neighborhood built environment and
only included two measures of walkability (one measure of connectivity and one measure of tra<U+FB03>c exposure) (D'Haese et al., 2014).
One notable di<U+FB00>erence between this literature and the current study is that, to our knowledge, only two studies considered active
transportation to destinations other than school (Oliver et al., 2016; Carlson et al., 2015).
    The current study found that all three components of the walkability index were associated with active transportation. Although
previous studies have found similar associations for measures of connectivity (Carlson et al., 2015; Helbich et al., 2016; Panter et al.,
2010), proximity to destinations (Wong et al., 2011; Duncan et al., 2016) and safety features (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Kerr et al.,
2006; Rothman et al., 2014), there is not uniformity in the literature. For example, Timperio et al. (2006) found that street connectivity was negatively associated with active commuting to school and Larsen et al. (2009) found the same for residential density.
This may be due to the increased pedestrian safety risk posed by more densely connected street networks such as increased tra<U+FB03>c,
higher speeds, and more street crossings (Sirard and Slater, 2008).
    Comprehensive walkability indexes created for studies of adults (Frank et al., 2010; Cervero, 2002; Owen et al., 2007) and
children (Carlson et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2006; Christiansen et al., 2016) have not typically considered tra<U+FB03>c safety. Within the
context of walkability, safety refers to pedestrians and cyclists being protected from automobile tra<U+FB03>c. Safety measures are often
excluded from built environment analyses because these variables are not widely available in existing GIS datasets (Frank et al.,
2010). This is an important limitation because, as shown in our study, these safety measures are associated with active transportation.
It has also been suggested that changing these safety features represents a simpler and more cost e<U+FB00>ective way of making changes to
the current infrastructure than would making changes to the some of the other walkability constructs, such as connectivity, since that
would require the physical restructuring of streets (Carver et al., 2008).
     The <U+FB01>ndings of our study have implications for public health practice and urban planning. The built environment can in<U+FB02>uence
large proportions of the population and has the potential to create sustained changes in walking and cycling habits (Sallis et al.,
2000). While it is not feasible to change the connectivity of existing neighborhoods, the potential to impact active transportation
should be considered in the construction of future neighborhoods. The current study also indicates that having an increased number
of destinations within walking distance and increasing safety features of a neighborhood could positively impact children's active
transportation behaviors. This could be accomplished by changing zoning policies to allow for retail space to be dispersed among
residential areas and adding more tra<U+FB03>c calming features to streets such as speed humps, low speed zones, and crosswalks. However,
the in<U+FB02>uence of built environment features on active transportation may be di<U+FB00>erent for children and adults: children and adolescents’ transportation choices may be more strongly in<U+FB02>uenced by tra<U+FB03>c safety concerns, especially for younger children (Panter
et al., 2008).
     There are several limitations of this study. First, this is a cross-sectional study. Reverse causality is a possibility as parents who
want their children to engage in active transportation could self-select neighborhoods that encourage this behavior (Oliver et al.,
2014). Second, we were not able to control for automobile availability in the household, which could have impacted the observed
associations. Third, the results may not be generalizable outside of municipalities that are similar to Kingston, a city with a population of 123,363 and Walk Score® of 49. Finally, because active transportation habits change with age (Robertson-Wilson et al.,
2008), these results may not be applicable to younger children and older adolescents.
5. Conclusions
     In this study of 10–13 year olds, those living in the most walkable neighborhoods accumulated more than twice as much active
transportation than those living in the least walkable neighborhoods. In addition, street connectivity, proximity to destinations, and
tra<U+FB03>c safety were each associated with increased active transportation. Future studies should consider using prospective cohort and
natural experiment designs to provide a stronger evidence base for the association between walkability and active transportation.
