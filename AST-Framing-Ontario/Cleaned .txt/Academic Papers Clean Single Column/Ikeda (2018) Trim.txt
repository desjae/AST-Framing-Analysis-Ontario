                                                            performed in SAS. Using stepwise logistic regression, age, school socioeconomic status, distance
                                                            to school, dwelling density and intersection density (400 m and 1 km bu<U+FB00>ers) were taken forward

1. Introduction
     The bene<U+FB01>ts of physical activity in childhood are signi<U+FB01>cant and widely accepted (World Health Organization, 2010). Regular
physical activity is associated with improved cognitive (Donnelly et al., 2016), cardiometabolic (Janssen and LeBlanc, 2010) and
musculoskeletal health (Tan et al., 2014), as well as reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety (Biddle and Asare, 2011). In-
su<U+FB03>cient physical activity is linked to the signi<U+FB01>cant rise in childhood obesity and comorbidities worldwide (Janssen and LeBlanc,
2010; Lee et al., 2012; Molnár and Livingstone, 2000). It is recommended that all children and young people achieve at least 60 min
of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity each day (Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, 2016; Ministry of Health,
2017). Globally, New Zealand fares relatively well in terms of child and youth participation in su<U+FB03>cient levels of physical activity
(Tremblay et al., 2016). Despite that a third of New Zealand children and young people remain insu<U+FB03>ciently active for health
(Maddison et al., 2016), and New Zealand has one of the highest rates of child obesity worldwide (Organisation for Ecnomic Co-
operation and Development, 2017).
     Several systematic reviews show that children and young people who commute actively (e.g., walk or cycle) to school are more
likely to attain recommended levels of physical activity than those who travel by motorised vehicle (e.g., public transport, car or
motorcycle) (Faulkner et al., 2009; Larouche et al., 2014). Uptake of active travel in childhood also increases the likelihood of active
commuting in later life (Telama et al., 2005). Active travel to school (ATS) permits children to develop navigational and tra<U+FB03>c safety
skills, identify and manage risks (Mammen et al., 2012), and gain experience in decision making and social interaction (Pooley et al.,
2010; Schoeppe et al., 2014). Unsupervised active travel—or independent mobility—can facilitate additional bene<U+FB01>ts, such as de-
veloping and re<U+FB01>ning resilience and life skills for the adult world, particularly in the context of risk taking (Gill, 2007; Mackett et al.,
2007).
     The positive implications of active travel go beyond the physical activity and health of individuals. Wider bene<U+FB01>ts include less
noise and air pollution, climate change mitigation, urban vitality, and reduced tra<U+FB03>c congestion. The annual economic cost of tra<U+FB03>c
congestion is estimated to be up to NZ$1.9 billion in Auckland alone (New Zealand Institute of Economic Research, 2017). Data from
2015 show that New Zealand's gross greenhouse gas emissions have increased 24% since 1990, and road transportation is one of the
main contributors to this increase (77.9% increase) (Ministry for the Environment, 2017). Increased uptake of ATS has the potential
to reduce overall tra<U+FB03>c volume and air pollution, particularly in urban areas around schools at peak commute times (Collins and
Kearns, 2010).
     Despite these bene<U+FB01>ts, the prevalence of children's ATS is declining worldwide. New Zealand has one of the lowest rates of ATS
internationally, with 28–29% of children aged 5–17 years walking and 2–3% cycling to school (Ministry of Transport, 2015;
Tremblay et al., 2016). Understanding the reasons for the low, and declining prevalence of ATS has become a priority for govern-
ments, urban planners, public health practitioners, and school and community groups. An interaction of multiple factors operating at
several levels a<U+FB00>ect ATS behaviour. Within a socio-ecological framework, these factors are broadly de<U+FB01>ned as individual (e.g.,
demographics, perceptions, skills), interpersonal (e.g., family and cultural norms) and broader environmental factors (e.g., built
environment and policy) (Timperio et al., 2006). A collective understanding of these in<U+FB02>uences is crucial to enhance uptake of ATS
among children and youth (Lambiase et al., 2010; Martínez-Gómez et al., 2011).
     Both age and sex are key associates of ATS. The 2014/15 New Zealand Health Survey illustrates that in youth aged 10–14 years, a
higher proportion of boys travel actively to school compared to girls (46.9% versus 40.6%) (Ministry of Health, 2015). No meaningful
di<U+FB00>erence by sex was observed for younger children. In New Zealand, more children aged 10–14 years utilised ATS (43.8%),
compared to those aged 5–9 years (38.4%) (Ministry of Health, 2015). The relationship between age and ATS is likely to be cur-
vilinear, with an initial age-related increase in ATS among children due to higher degrees of independent mobility, parental al-
lowances, and public transport use. ATS occurs to a small degree; followed by a decrease due to longer distances to secondary (high)
schools compared with localised primary (elementary) schools (Gordon-Larsen et al., 2005; Mandic et al., 2017a; Mandic et al.,
2015). There is some evidence of ethnic di<U+FB00>erences in ATS in New Zealand – with children of Maori, Paci<U+FB01>c Island, and “other”
ethnicities more likely to walk to primary school in Dunedin than New Zealand European children (Yelavich et al., 2008). Household
factors such as larger household sizes and having older siblings may also increase the likelihood of ATS (Lin et al., 2017; Mandic et al.,
2015). There is a trend towards increased ATS in children and youth residing in more socio-economically deprived neighbourhoods
(Ministry of Health, 2015). Boys residing in areas with the highest levels of socio-economic deprivation are signi<U+FB01>cantly more likely
to use ATS than their male peers living in areas with the lowest levels of socioeconomic deprivation (Ministry of Health, 2015).
     A key principle of socio-ecological theory is that motivating individuals to change behaviour cannot be e<U+FB00>ective if environments
make it di<U+FB03>cult or impossible to choose healthy behaviours (Sallis et al., 2008). Rather, creating environments that make it con-
venient, attractive, safe and economical to make healthy choices (and then motivating and educating people about those choices) will
likely be most e<U+FB00>ective. Built environments comprise all physical surroundings that are constructed through human activity, in-
cluding buildings, roads, open spaces and infrastructure (Srinivasan et al., 2003). A number of built environment factors have been
associated with ATS, which are discussed brie<U+FB02>y below.
     A convincing body of research in New Zealand as well as worldwide has demonstrated that network distance to school is the most
consistent built environmental factor associated with the likelihood of ATS (Davison et al., 2008; Huertas-Delgado et al., 2017;
Mandic et al., 2015; Oliver et al., 2014; Oliver et al., 2015; Pont et al., 2009; Schlossberg et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2011). For
example, children living within one mile (1.6 km) of school in the US were at least three times more likely to walk or cycle to school
than those living outside the one mile radius (McDonald et al., 2011; McMillan, 2007; McMillan et al., 2006). Similarly, McDonald
(2008) showed that travel time had the greatest e<U+FB00>ect on ATS, where a 10% increase in walking time was associated with a 7.5%
decline in probability of walking to school in the US. In a sample of 595 New Zealand children and youth aged 8–14 years, a distance
                                                                    118

of 1.4 km or less best predicted likelihood of ATS (Duncan et al., 2016). However, threshold distances are likely much further for
cycling, with some studies from the US and Spain reporting threshold distances of up to 5 km (Chillón et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2008;
Schlossberg et al., 2006).
     Connectivity refers to the directness and availability of travel routes between an origin and a destination (Thornton et al., 2011).
Street connectivity o<U+FB00>ers the potential of increased ways to discover direct and shorter travel routes (Schlossberg et al., 2006).
Connectivity is generally measured or assessed using the spacing between streets, the number of three-way or four-way intersections
within an area, or the di<U+FB00>erence between the street and pedestrian network distance and the Euclidean (i.e. ‘as the crow <U+FB02>ies’)
distance (Thornton et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2011). For adults, grid-design urban environments are associated with signi<U+FB01>cantly
greater physical activity levels (Badland et al., 2008; Hirsch et al., 2014; Sugiyama et al., 2012). Among the few studies investigating
associations between street connectivity and physical activity in children, <U+FB01>ndings showed both positive (Oliver et al., 2015;
Schlossberg et al., 2006) and no association (Braza et al., 2004). One study has shown positive associations between street con-
nectivity and active travel to all destinations in children (Oliver et al., 2015).
     Population or residential density refers to the number of individuals or dwellings in a particular area. Density is in turn associated
with accessibility and increased rates of active travel because housing is closer to a range of destinations (Thornton et al., 2011).
Active travel among children living in urban areas (with high population density) in the US was found to be more common than in
their rural or suburban counterparts (with sparse population density) (McDonald, 2008). Adolescents living in urban areas have been
shown to accumulate most of their physical activity during school travel (Stewart et al., 2017a), whereas those in more rural areas
achieve the majority of their activity during school hours (Rainham et al., 2012). However, these <U+FB01>ndings are not consistent in all
geographic regions. In the Otago region of New Zealand youth living in rural areas reported higher rates of ATS compared to their
urban counterparts (Mandic et al., 2015).
     The diversity of land use within a region (e.g., residential, educational, commercial, industrial, and recreational) can have im-
plications for children and young people's active travel. Mixed land uses within a localised area can reduce the distance to desti-
nations, thereby providing more active travel opportunities (Thornton et al., 2011). Higher land use mix has been associated with
ATS (D'Haese et al., 2014; Larsen et al., 2009) as well as overall physical activity and total walking trips in youth (Kerr et al., 2007;
Kligerman et al., 2007). These studies allude to the importance of destination accessibility and diversity for active travel in children
and youth.
     In the New Zealand context, di<U+FB00>erences in geographic information systems (GIS) approaches across studies have hindered an
ability to provide a clear and consistent understanding of the built environment associates of ATS in children and youth nationally.
Therefore, the aims of this study were: (1) to systematically identify New Zealand research that had measured ATS, distance to school,
and the neighbourhood built environment in children and youth, (2) to collate data from identi<U+FB01>ed studies and combine them in a
consistent manner, and (3) to identify associations between ATS and built environment features across the combined dataset. In doing
so, this study provides new, robust evidence that has greater statistical power and is more generalisable than the contributing
standalone studies.
2. Methods
2.1. Research context
     The total population in New Zealand was estimated at 4.8 million in 2017, and a <U+FB01>fth of the population was children and youth
aged 5–19 years (Statistics New Zealand, 2017d). New Zealand is also characterised as a highly suburbanised nation. By the end of
20th century, there are 20 main urban areas with a minimum population of 30,000 identi<U+FB01>ed in New Zealand – 16 out of 20 are
located in the North Island (e.g., Aucklnad, Wellington) and the others in the South Island (e.g., Christchurch, Dunedin) (Statistics
New Zealand, 2017a). Due to changes in urban form, the population has been shifted towards car-oriented, low density neigh-
bourhoods over the last few decades (Witten et al., 2017) which has resulted in greater urban sprawl and a change in children's mode
of school travel and mobility.
     In New Zealand, there are more than 180 di<U+FB00>erent ethnic groups including indigenous Maori and migrants from Europe, Paci<U+FB01>c
Islands and Asian countries. The distribution of the ethnic groups with the majority of European, Maori and Asian varies across
regions and cities (Statistics New Zealand, 2017b). In New Zealand, ethnicity is a self-perceived and cultural concept which is
considered as a key social factor along with the other demographic characteristics describing the population (Statistics New Zealand,
2017b).
2.2. Eligibility criteria
     Experimental studies or interventions (i.e., randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies), longitudinal/cohort studies,
and cross-sectional studies were eligible for inclusion. Participants in the included studies were school-aged children between <U+FB01>ve
and 19 years living in New Zealand. In order to be eligible, studies needed to have reported participants’ mode of travel to school, and
collected objective measures of the neighbourhood built environment using GIS. Travel mode could be self-reported by children, their
parents, or obtained by observation.
                                                                     119

car, bus and motorbike.
2.3. Information sources and search strategy
     Scholarly published journal articles were searched in the following seven academic databases: SPORTDiscus (via EBSCO Host),
ABI/Inform (via ProQuest), Web of Science, Scopus, NZResearch.org.nz (New Zealand theses), NewzText (New Zealand newspapers
and commentary sources), and Australian/New Zealand Reference Centre (via EBSCO Host) (New Zealand newspapers and com-
mentary from local sources). Unpublished research (i.e., New Zealand Master's and Doctoral theses) were sought through New
Zealand Educational Theses Database (via New Zealand Council for Educational Research), Aotearoa New Zealand International
Development Studies Network, and Scholarly Commons/Institutional Repository (i.e. Auckland University of Technology, Massey
University, University of Auckland, University of Canterbury, University of Otago, University of Waikato, Victoria University of
Wellington). Government and local council related reports were sought through major Government agency websites (i.e., Ministry of
Health, Ministry of Transport, New Zealand Transport Agency/Land Transport New Zealand) and generally through Google.
Combinations of the following search terms and terms were used: “active travel/transport”, “mode* travel/transport”, “school”,
“Zealand”, “walk*”, “bik*”, “trip*”, “car*”. For a full list of search <U+FB01>elds refer to Supplementary information. The search was limited
to English language and year from January 1990 to June 2016. Searches were conducted between May and July 2016.
2.4. Selection of studies
     Fig. 1 shows a <U+FB02>ow chart for article identi<U+FB01>cation and selection. The initial search strategy produced nearly 24,000 articles. An
initial screening of titles and abstracts was undertaken to remove those which were outside the scope of the review based on the
eligibility criteria. The full text were obtained for articles and reports that passed this initial abstract screening process – 49 were
considered potentially eligible and were assessed at the full text stage. Full texts of 12 articles and reports met the inclusion criteria.
Finally, multiple publications and reports on the same study were linked together (n = 4), yielding a total of eight studies identi<U+FB01>ed
as eligible. The raw data of primary and secondary outcomes were acquired by contacting the original authors of the included studies.
Three authors failed or declined to send raw data and these studies were thus excluded, leaving <U+FB01>ve studies for inclusion in the meta-
analysis.
2.5. Data preparation and synthesis
     The following variables were obtained (at the individual participant level) from each study author: participant demographics
                                                                        120

E. Ikeda et al.                                                                                    Journal of Transport & Health 9 (2018) 117–131
(age, sex, number of siblings, household size, body measurements), mode of travel ‘to’ school (excluding ‘from’ school), and GIS-
derived distance to school, intersection density, dwelling density, and land use mix using a 400 m and a 1 km street network bu<U+FB00>er
around each participant's place of residence. Bu<U+FB00>ers are boundaries placed around areas or points using a prede<U+FB01>ned scale, and
delineated using straight-line (Euclidean) or street network distance (Thornton et al., 2011). In addition, general information about
neighbourhood and participant selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria, individual study analyses, and published results and study
protocols were requested. TS liaised with all study authors to ensure consistent approaches to generating neighbourhood bu<U+FB00>ers and
built environment variables were undertaken.
2.5.1. Individual characteristics
     Participant age was classi<U+FB01>ed into six groups ( < 13, 13, 14, 15, 16, = 17 years): less than 13 years, by age in years between 13
and 16, and more than 17 years in order to detect any possible curvilinearity in relationships, and to ensure su<U+FB03>cient numbers in
each age group.
     Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height, and categorised into weight classes (normal, overweight, obese)
using growth curve data from the World Health Organization (de Onis et al., 2007). Age was missing for 19 participants, in which
case age was imputed using the mean age for the participants from the same school year level.
2.5.2. School characteristics
     Data from the Ministry of Education were used to classify each school into contributing (children aged 5–10 years), full primary
(5–12 years), intermediate (11–12 years), or secondary (13–17 years), and to identify school decile values. School decile indicates the
socio-economic status of households in a school's catchment area. Deciles ranging from 1 (being the 10% of schools with the highest
proportion of pupils residing in low socio-economic areas), to 10 (being the 10% of schools with the lowest proportion of these
students) (Ministry of Education, 2017).
2.5.3. School travel mode
     Three studies (Hinckson et al., 2014; Oliver et al., 2014; Rush et al., 2016) collected travel mode data across each of the <U+FB01>ve
school days, and one (Mandic et al., 2016) had a 5-scale response for each travel mode (“never”, “rarely”, “sometimes”, “most of the
time”, “all of the time”). The only school travel information available from the <U+FB01>nal study (Oliver et al., 2011) pertained to ‘usual’
travel mode (e.g., “car”, “walk”, “bike” etc.). For this reason, travel mode data across all studies were dichotomised as 0 or 1, where 0
referred to individuals who used passive modes of travel (i.e., car, bus, motorbike) and 1 represented individuals who used active
forms of travel (i.e., walk, bicycle, scooter, skateboard) on three or more school days per week (Ross et al., 2017; Veitch et al., 2017),
or “most of the time”. As ATS was a binary response variable, logistic regression (SAS proc logistic) was performed to test whether
each variable was associated with (the odds of) active travel to school. Individuals living further than 10 km from school were
excluded from analyses. The rationale for this was two-fold: (1) based on visual inspection of the distance to school data, those living
further than 10 km from school were considered outliers, and (2) previous New Zealand research suggests this threshold would be
su<U+FB03>ciently sensitive to capture most ATS (Duncan et al., 2016; Oliver et al., 2014).
2.5.4. Built environment variables
     Dwelling density was calculated as the number of private occupied dwellings per square kilometer. The number of dwellings per
meshblock were obtained from the 2013 Census (Statistics New Zealand, 2014), and an area weighted average was used to estimate
the number of dwellings within each bu<U+FB00>er. Parcel-level zoning data were used to calculate land use mix, which is an indicator of the
variety of local destinations close to home. Land use was categorised as residential, commercial, public open space, industrial,
recreation, or other. An entropy score was used to calculate the extent of land use mix inside each bu<U+FB00>er using the equation (Forsyth
et al., 2012) for four studies (Hinckson et al., 2014; Oliver et al., 2014; Oliver et al., 2011; Rush et al., 2016):
                              n
                           <U+239B>              <U+239E>
         Land use mix = -<U+239C> <U+2211> Pi * ln(Pi ) <U+239F> / ln(n)
                           <U+239D> i=1          <U+23A0>
where n is the number of di<U+FB00>erent land use categories and Pi is the proportion of land use category i in the region. Entropy scores
range from 0, which indicates no mix or homogeneous land use, to 1 which represents heterogeneous land use, or a perfect mix. One
study (Mandic et al., 2016) calculated land use mix using a di<U+FB00>erent equation (Cervero and Kockelman, 1997):
                         <U+23A7>
         Land use mix =    <U+2211> <U+23A1><U+2211>j Pjk ln (pjk ) <U+23A4><U+23A5>/ln(J ) <U+23AB><U+23AC>/K
                         <U+23A8> k <U+23A2>
                         <U+23A9>      <U+23A3>                <U+23A6>        <U+23AD>
where Pjk is the proportion of land use category j within a half-mile radius of the developed area surrounding grid-cell k, and K is
number of actively developed hectares in each tract. The parcel level land use data used to calculate land use mix was compiled from
a variety of sources: territorial authority zoning data, territorial authority points of interest data sourced in 2013/2014 (e.g., parks,
libraries), and Zenbu online business directory data extracted in 2014. Lastly, intersection density was calculated as the number of 3
or more-way intersections per square kilometer, using road centerline data obtained from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ;
www.linz.govt.nz). The calculation of these variables was consistent with previous work in New Zealand (Badland et al., 2009;
Hinckson et al., 2014).
                                                                     121

E. Ikeda et al.                                                                                    Journal of Transport & Health 9 (2018) 117–131
     In the <U+FB01>rst instance, frequency distributions of categorical data were checked and recategorized if necessary (i.e., if a dis-
proportionately low number of responses was observed in one or more categories). Due to logistic regression assuming an exponential
relationship for continuous variables and because non-linear and plateauing e<U+FB00>ects can exist when examining built environment
variables, these variables (dwelling density, intersection density, and land use mix) were organised into quartiles.
2.6. Statistical analysis
     A one-step individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis approach was taken. This di<U+FB00>ers from more traditional meta-analyses
where aggregate data (e.g., e<U+FB00>ect size estimates) are extracted from individual studies and synthesised. In a one-step approach, the
original IPD from all studies is modelled simultaneously. All analyses were performed in SAS (v9.4, SAS Institute, North Carolina,
NC).
     Using stepwise logistic regression, an initial feature selection step was performed to determine what variables were suitable for
inclusion in the <U+FB01>nal model. A criterion of p < 0.10 was set for inclusion in the model, and age, sex, ethnicity and number of siblings,
were included as <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects, being known correlates of ATS behaviour (Chillón et al., 2014; Christiansen et al., 2014; Mandic et al.,
2015; Yu and Zhu, 2016). The clustering of observations within studies was accounted for by stratifying the analysis by study (i.e., by
estimating a separate intercept for each study) using the STRATA statement (SAS Institute Inc., 2011). Individual study results for the
full model were also calculated and presented for each outcome variable using forest plots.
3. Results
     Overall, <U+FB01>ve studies involving 2844 children and youth aged 6–19 years were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1)
(Hinckson et al., 2014; Mandic et al., 2016; Oliver et al., 2014; Oliver et al., 2011; Rush et al., 2016). In total, there were 988 active
travellers, and 1856 passive travellers. Studies were conducted in three of the largest cities in New Zealand, namely Auckland (urban
population of 1.495 million, comprising 32% of the total New Zealand population), Wellington (population 405,000), and
Christchurch (389,700) (Statistics New Zealand, 2016). Additionally, one study was conducted in Dunedin, New Zealand's seventh
largest city, with a population of 118,500. Detailed information about each study is summarised in the Supplementary information 2.
     Participant demographic characteristics, rates of ATS, and the results of the bivariate analyses are presented in Table 2. De-
scriptive information for the built environment characteristics and results of the bivariate analyses for these variables are presented in
Table 3. Age, school decile, dwelling density, intersection density (400 m and 1 km bu<U+FB00>er), and distance to school were related to ATS
at p < 0.10 in the bivariate analyses and were taken forward into the multiple variable modelling, along with the aforementioned
<U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects (age, sex, ethnicity and number of siblings).
     Table 4 presents the logistic regression results for the <U+FB01>nal multiple variable model. Accounting for the <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects (age, sex,
ethnicity, number of siblings) and after removal of non-signi<U+FB01>cant variables at p > 0.05, remaining factors in the model were number
of siblings, school decile, distance to school, and intersection density and dwelling density within 1 km bu<U+FB00>ers only. Compared with
children who had no siblings, those with one sibling were 30% less likely to use ATS (95% CI 0.48, 0.96, p < 0.02). Children and
youth attending higher decile (higher socio-economic status) schools were less likely to travel actively compared to those attending
lower decile schools (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.78, 1.79, p = 0.001). The greatest odds for ATS were found for distance to school, with the
odds of ATS near zero for those living more than 2.3 km from school. Using the 1 km neighbourhood bu<U+FB00>er, a linear increase in odds
of ATS was observed for intersection density, with those living in neighbourhoods with the highest intersection density almost three
times more likely to use ATS than those living in neighbourhoods with the lowest intersection density (OR 2.86, 95% CI 1.95, 4.17,
p < 0.001). Conversely (and somewhat counterintuitively), a negative relationship was observed between ATS and dwelling density.
We conducted exploratory work to examine these perplexing results. These examinations suggested a possible level of interaction
between dwelling density and distance to school, with a combination of lower housing density and shorter distance to schools linked
with ATS (data available on request).
     We further examined distance to school, intersection density and dwelling density as associates of ATS for each individual study.
Fig. 2 shows the forest plot for individual study results, comparing quartiles 1 with quartiles 2, 3, and 4 for each variable. Distance to
school showed signi<U+FB01>cantly negative associations with ATS with all except one comparison from the Understanding the Relationship
between Activity and Neighbourhoods (URBAN) study (Oliver et al., 2014). Within many of the individual studies there were no

signi<U+FB01>cant <U+FB01>ndings for dwelling and intersection density. However, studies did show homogeneity in results, which resulted in
signi<U+FB01>cant <U+FB01>ndings overall. With the exception of the Kids in the City (KITC) study (Oliver et al., 2011), individual study <U+FB01>ndings
were relatively consistent with null or negative correlates for dwelling density. For intersection density, greater odds ratios and
con<U+FB01>dence intervals were observed for the KITC study, and the URBAN study (Oliver et al., 2014).
4. Discussion
     The aims of this study were: (1) to systematically identify New Zealand research that had measured ATS, distance to school, and
the neighbourhood built environment in children and youth, (2) to collate data from identi<U+FB01>ed studies and combine them in a
consistent manner, and (3) to identify associations between ATS and built environment features across the combined dataset. In doing
so, this study provides new, robust evidence and greater statistical power that is more generalisable than the previous contributing
smaller studies. In total, data from 2844 children and young people were obtained from <U+FB01>ve studies representing four major cities
across New Zealand. Approximately a third of the participants used ATS “usually” or “most of the time”. For the most part, asso-
ciations between environmental variables and ATS were consistent with previous research (Broberg and Sarjala, 2015; Carlson et al.,
2014; Larsen et al., 2016; Pont et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2011) and the individual studies themselves.
4.1. Distance to school
     Overall, the relationship between distance to school and odds of ATS had the greatest magnitude of all ATS associations observed
even after accounting for all other factors in the <U+FB01>nal model.This <U+FB01>nding is not surprising given the body of existing evidence
demonstrating this relationship (Duncan et al., 2016; Ermagun and Samimi, 2017; Larsen et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013; Mandic et al.,

2015; McDonald et al., 2011; Schlossberg et al., 2006). Compared to children living within 1.3 km of school, the odds of ATS were
reduced by a third among those residing between 1.3 and 2.3 km from school. Beyond 2.3 km, the odds of ATS in this combined
dataset reduced to near zero. This distance threshold is in line with earlier research indicating signi<U+FB01>cant and substantial reductions
in ATS for distances of 1.4–2.0 km (Mandic et al., 2017b; McDonald et al., 2011; McMillan, 2007; McMillan et al., 2006; Oliver et al.,
2014). The results of the individual studies were similar, with the exception of comparing quartile 1 and quartile 2 for the URBAN
study whereby the 95% con<U+FB01>dence intervals crossed over one, indicating a non-signi<U+FB01>cant association for this comparison only. To
some extent, the wider con<U+FB01>dence interval may have been a function of the smaller sample size in the URBAN study compared to
other included studies (Oliver et al., 2014). Collectively, the evidence shows that shorter school travel distances are signi<U+FB01>cantly
associated with increased walking and cycling to school (Wong et al., 2011). Schools located centrally within communities are likely
to facilitate children's ATS. Therefore, location of schools and zoning restrictions are important considerations to optimise travel
distances and the likelihood for ATS (Mandic et al., 2017b; Oliver et al., 2014).
4.2. Street connectivity
     In line with previous research (Schlossberg et al., 2006), a clear positive relationship between street connectivity and ATS was
observed when using the 1 km neighbourhood bu<U+FB00>er. Children and youth living in neighbourhoods with the highest intersection
density were almost three times more likely to use ATS than those living in neighbourhoods with the lowest intersection density. This
<U+FB01>nding was, however, in con<U+FB02>ict with other studies from Australia (Timperio et al., 2006), the US (Carlson et al., 2014) and Canada
(Mitra and Buliung, 2012) which reported negative associations between intersection density and ATS. Highly connected streets may
be more utilised by motorised vehicles. Consequently, children and youth living in those areas, compared to those living in areas with
low street connectivity, could be more exposed to high tra<U+FB03>c speed and volume and less likely to use ATS (Sirard and Slater, 2008).
Use of pedestrian or walkable networks to calculate intersection density may increase the speci<U+FB01>city and sensitivity of results and
provide more precise information for active travellers.

4.3. Dwelling density
     A somewhat counterintuitive <U+FB01>nding emerged in relation to dwelling density, whereby increased dwelling density (using a 1 km
bu<U+FB00>er only) was associated with reduced rates of ATS in children and youth. With the exception of the KITC study, all studies showed
a trend towards reduced ATS with increasing dwelling density. It is possible the di<U+FB00>erences observed for the KITC study were due to
the comparatively smaller sample size (compared to other included studies), and the focus on medium-to-high density neighbour-
hoods in this project (Oliver et al., 2011). Overall, the <U+FB01>ndings for dwelling density are in contrast with earlier research showing
positive relationships with ATS (Carlson et al., 2014; Kerr et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2009). To investigate this further, inter-
relationships between the built environment variables were considered in modelling associations with ATS (data available on re-
quest). An interesting pattern was observed, whereby there was some evidence for an interaction e<U+FB00>ect for dwelling density and
distance to school. In particular, <U+FB01>ndings indicated that a combination of low dwelling density and low distance to school may be
positively related to ATS. It is likely that the short distance to school overrode the impact of dwelling density on this relationship, so
these <U+FB01>ndings must be interpreted with caution. Further investigation into the links between neighbourhood density, tra<U+FB03>c volumes,
road safety and ATS is warranted. It is possible that the relationship for dwelling density is curvilinear, with neighbourhoods of
extremely low dwelling density (e.g., in rural areas, also characterised as having low walkability overall (Hansen et al., 2015)) and
extremely high dwelling density (e.g., apartment blocks in central city areas) o<U+FB00>ering little in the way of supporting ATS.
4.4. School characteristics
     Neighbourhood-level socio-economic status was associated with ATS, with individuals attending higher decile (higher socio-
economic status) schools being signi<U+FB01>cantly less likely to travel actively compared to those attending lower decile schools. Economic
                                                                         125

factors contributing to ATS can include car ownership (Mandic et al., 2015) and access, and employment status of parents/caregivers
(Lin et al., 2017). It is possible these factors contributed to higher ATS in children and youth residing in lower socio-economic
neighbourhoods. However, it was not possible to include these factors in modelling due to di<U+FB00>erences in measures taken across
studies.
4.5. Individual characteristics
     Age, sex, ethnicity and number of siblings were retained in the <U+FB01>nal model as <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects, irrespective of statistical signi<U+FB01>cance.
Consistent with previous research (Larsen et al., 2016; Yu and Zhu, 2016), females were less likely to use ATS than their male peers.
In contrast to our expectations, no signi<U+FB01>cant relationships were observed for the other <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects. In the New Zealand context,
children of Maori, Paci<U+FB01>c Island, and “other” ethnicities have reported higher ATS than their New Zealand European counterparts
(Yelavich et al., 2008). This was not the case in the current research. It is hypothesised that socio-economic deprivation (as observed
with the school decile being one of the signi<U+FB01>cant associations of ATS) may have a greater impact on ATS than ethnicity. Meaning
that when socio-economic factors are taken into account, the e<U+FB00>ect of ethnicity could be negligible. Compared with participants with
no siblings, those with one sibling were less likely to use ATS, and the relationship was not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant for those with two
or more siblings. Earlier New Zealand research has shown a positive impact of having older siblings in the household on children's
independent mobility (Lin et al., 2017). It is likely that a similar pattern existed in the research included here, but it was not possible
to account for age of siblings in this analysis as those data were not measured across all studies.
4.6. Limitations and other considerations for active school travel in children and youth
     The heterogeneity in study designs and variables measured across included studies limited our ability to consider a range of
factors that may have been important in modelling the relationship between ATS and the neighbourhood built environment. Firstly,
due to di<U+FB00>erent measures used for mode of travel to school across the studies, only a dichotomous category of active versus passive
travel was employed in the meta-analysis, preventing the examination of individual travel modes such as walking versus cycling
(Mandic et al., 2017a; Trapp et al., 2011). In terms of the objective built environment, pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure and
destination accessibility were not able to be examined in the current study. Pedestrian infrastructure and tra<U+FB03>c calming along routes
to school, such as constructing sidewalks and cycle lanes have shown promise for increasing children's ATS (Boarnet et al., 2005; Kim
and Heinrich, 2016). However, con<U+FB02>icting associations exist—particularly for increasing the uptake of cycling (Pucher et al., 2010).
Crossing streets can be perceived as a dangerous activity for children, especially when crossing main or busy streets, and particularly
for young children. Indeed, an Australian survey showed that parents viewed road crossings to school and tra<U+FB03>c calming around the
school entrance as major factors in<U+FB02>uencing their decision about their child's mode of travel to school (Cole et al., 2007). Children
who had to cross a main street on the route to school were more likely to be driven to school than to walk or cycle (Bringolf-Isler
et al., 2008). A recent systematic review found strong evidence for the impact of multiple streetscape components (including two or
more of: crosswalk/sidewalk improvements, improved/covered bike parking, tra<U+FB03>c calming features and safe places to walk) on
children's active travel (to school and other destinations) (Smith et al., 2017). Other features such as topography may also impact
                                                                        126

E. Ikeda et al.                                                                                    Journal of Transport & Health 9 (2018) 117–131
decision-making around school travel modes and routes, but little is known in this area (Stewart et al., 2017b; Timperio et al., 2006).
In the New Zealand context, cycling to secondary school is less common than walking, is perceived as less safe, and receives less
infrastructure and social support compared to walking (Mandic et al., 2017a). However, regional di<U+FB00>erences exists within New
Zealand (Frater et al., 2017). Further work in this area is needed to identify speci<U+FB01>c environmental factors that generate the greatest
impact on children's walking and cycling to school behaviours and active travel in general.
     Collectively, population density, street connectivity, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and destination diversity a<U+FB00>ect overall
accessibility to destinations, or how easily a range of destinations can be reached on foot or by bicycle (Vale et al., 2016). There are a
number of objective (e.g., a spatially-derived indices) or subjective (e.g., questionnaires) measures that have been developed and
used to assess the walking potential of an area, such as the Walkability Index and Walk Score (Vale et al., 2016). However, measuring
how conducive an environment is for children's walking or cycling is less developed. Most recently a child-speci<U+FB01>c neighbourhood
destination accessibility index (NDAI-C) was developed in New Zealand (Badland et al., 2015) which has been associated with active
travel modes on weekdays (Oliver et al., 2015). To some extent, the measure of land use mix used in the current study provides an
indicator of diversity of destination types in the neighbourhood, but this does not capture information about destinations of speci<U+FB01>c
importance to children, or the number of destinations within a region. Future research examining destination accessibility in relation
to children's and adolescents’ travel behaviours is needed.
     A number of social and perceived variables such as encouragement and supports for ATS were not included in this study, but may
be important in understanding associations between the built environment and ATS. Firstly, neighbourhood self-selection may impact
travel behaviours (Cao et al., 2009), but was not measured in the current study. In New Zealand, school choice decisions are
in<U+FB02>uenced by social factors and school programmes/facilities rather than proximity to home (Mandic et al., 2017c) and have im-
portant implications for ATS to secondary schools, particularly in higher socioeconomic status areas. One New Zealand study showed
that adolescents who enrolled in the closest school to home had <U+FB01>ve times higher rates of ATS and lower rates of motorised travel to
school compared to their counterparts (Mandic et al., 2017b). Thus choice of neighbourhood, and choice of school, assuming families
are able to make these choices, can have substantial impacts on the likelihood of ATS in children and young people.
     One of the most commonly reported barriers to ATS for children and young people is parental perceptions of neighbourhood
safety (Egli et al., in press; Hinckson, 2016; Yeung et al., 2008). Research from the US shows parental perceptions of neighbourhood
safety and attitudes towards ATS had a greater in<U+FB02>uence on children's ATS behaviours than physical environment (i.e., presence of
sidewalks) (McMillan, 2007). Speci<U+FB01>c barriers to uptake of ATS, combining the social and physical environment, include high tra<U+FB03>c
volume and speed, poor visibility, unsafe or inadequate road crossings, dangerous driving and parking, stranger-danger, and fear of
crime (Giles-Corti et al., 2009; Kerr et al., 2006; McMillan, 2007). In addition, cycling is perceived to be a less safe mode of travel to
school compared to walking by New Zealand adolescents (Mandic et al., 2017a). Giles-Corti et al. (2009) viewed the integral role of
parents as ‘gatekeepers’ of children's travel mode choice and travel behaviours. While crime and stranger-danger in New Zealand
have not increased over time (New Zealand Police, 2015), parental concerns about tra<U+FB03>c safety are justi<U+FB01>ed, with a substantially
increased risk of tra<U+FB03>c-related injuries and deaths for child pedestrians and cyclists (Sonkin et al., 2006; Statistics New Zealand,
2017c).
4.7. Strengths and implications
     A strength of the current study was the use of consistent approaches to neighbourhood bu<U+FB00>er development and subsequent
generation of objective built environment measures across studies. The choice of bu<U+FB00>ers depends on the type of environmental
exposures being measured, and the level of spatial interactions (i.e., potential or actual) to capture (Chaix et al., 2012; Thornton et al.,
2011). When examining the e<U+FB00>ects of contextual in<U+FB02>uences on ATS, fundamental methodological issues arise, namely the modi<U+FB01>able
area unit problem (MAUP) and the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). The MAUP and UGCoP refer to the e<U+FB00>ects of
spatial scale and zoning versus spatial and temporal uncertainty of the contextual in<U+FB02>uences (Clark and Scott, 2014; Kwan, 2012;
Openshaw, 1979; Vale et al., 2016). Discrepancies in spatial units across studies may hinder comparisons between research <U+FB01>ndings
because the e<U+FB00>ects of the contextual variables may change depending on the geographic areas de<U+FB01>ned in the studies.
     Another strength of this study was the systematic approach to identifying studies for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Data could
not be retrieved for three of the eight eligible studies, resulting in the potential for bias in terms of geographic and demographic
representation. However, we believe the potential for bias was small, with the <U+FB01>nal dataset for this study including 2844 participants
residing in four major cities across New Zealand. Ultimately, this research has enabled greater statistical power than with individual
studies, and greater con<U+FB01>dence in the representativeness of the <U+FB01>ndings for children and youth residing in New Zealand cities.
Reporting bias of individual studies was negligible, with all included studies having published protocols. Opportunities exist for
future research to explore the impact of the built environment on di<U+FB00>erent travel modes such as walking vs. cycling and car vs. public
transport (e.g., mixed travel modes (Stewart et al., 2017b): buses, trains, ferries) to pro<U+FB01>le and understand these associates and
behaviours. For example, information on cycling to school may highlight a need for new cycling infrastructure and safety strategies
for children and younger people, and develop policy and programmes for this population (Mandic et al., 2018a, 2018b).
5. Conclusion
     In this large study of New Zealand children and youth, signi<U+FB01>cant negative relationships were observed between the likelihood of
ATS and distance to school, dwelling density and school scioeconomic status. Odds of ATS were positively associated with inter-
section density. The <U+FB01>ndings of this meta-analysis suggest that factors that in<U+FB02>uence distance to school such as school location and
                                                                     127

school zoning/catchment policies have signi<U+FB01>cant in<U+FB02>uence on school travel mode. Therefore, these factors should be taken into
account in planning decisions for school locations. In addition, improving connectivity in school neighbourhoods (e.g., through
creating walking and cycle paths, trails and greenways) may have positive e<U+FB00>ects on ATS in New Zealand children and youth.
