Identifying Parent Perspectives
to Guide Active Travel Intervention
with Small Populations
Case Study in Denver, Colorado
Kelly Draper Zuniga
This paper investigates a strategy for guiding school-based active travel
intervention. School-based active travel programs address the travel
behaviors and perceptions of small target populations (i.e., at individual
schools) so they can encourage people to walk or bike. Thus, planners need
to know as much as possible about the behaviors and perceptions of their
target populations. However, existing strategies for modeling travel behav-
ior and segmenting audiences typically work with larger populations and
may not capture the attitudinal diversity of smaller groups. This case study
used Q technique to identify salient travel-related attitude types among
parents at an elementary school in Denver, Colorado; 161 parents
presented their perspectives about school travel by rank-ordering
36 statements from strongly disagree to strongly agree in a normalized
distribution, single centered around no opinion. Thirty-nine respondents’
cases were selected for case-wise cluster analysis in SPSS according to cri-
teria that made them most likely to walk: proximity to school, grade, and
bus service. Analysis revealed five core perspectives that were then corre-
lated with the larger respondent pool: optimistic walkers, fair-weather
walkers, drivers of necessity, determined drivers, and fence sitters. Core
perspectives are presented—characterized by parents’ opinions, personal
characteristics, and reported travel behaviors—and recommendations are
made for possible intervention approaches. The study concludes that Q
technique provides a fine-grained assessment of travel behavior for small
populations, which would benefit small-scale behavioral interventions.


Recent transportation policies, including bike shares, bikeways, and

safe routes to school programs, highlight public efforts to increase

the proportion of short trips made by walking or biking (1–3). Plan-

ners explain that these active travel modes offer a cleaner, greener,

and healthier alternative to automobile dependence (3–8).

To design policies and programs that will make walking and bik-

ing more attractive options than driving, planners need to understand

the extent to which various factors influence the travel behaviors and

perceptions of their target populations. Traditional quantitative travel
behavior research is well-suited for estimating behavioral tendencies
of large populations. However, programs that work in individual
schools and other organizations often deal with small, culturally

diverse populations. To guide small-scale programs, planners need a
better grasp of the behaviors and perceptions of those target groups
so they can encourage individuals to walk or bike.
The purpose of this study is to assess perceptions of travel alterna-
tives with small populations that planners may target for behavioral
intervention. This paper presents findings from a study that used a
sorting exercise with case-wise cluster analysis to examine parents’
perceptions of travel to and from an elementary school in Denver,
Colorado. The study revealed five core perspectives: optimistic walk-
ers, fair-weather walkers, drivers of necessity, determined drivers,
and fence sitters. By aligning the perspectives with intervention
approaches, findings from this study illustrate the capacity of the
research approach to guide small-scale intervention.


PREVIOUS RESEARCH

Planning research often describes travel behavior for school trips in
terms of a perspective that emphasizes the students’ opportunity to
walk to school in terms of key environmental barriers. This interpre-
tation suggests that parents share a positive opinion of walking to
school but are unable to achieve that goal due to external constraints.
For example, several studies (3, 9–15) found that distance between
home and school was a key predictor of mode choice. The findings
implied that because travel behavior was significantly influenced by

distance, school districts would need to change their catchment areas

or enrollment policies to encourage students to walk. As another

example, several studies (3, 14, 16, 17) asked parents to pick from

among several reasons why they drive to school. Some (12, 16, 18, 19)

identified traffic danger and others (3, 14, 17, 19) identified stranger

danger as key obstacles to walking. Those findings would focus

intervention on one or the other problem, assuming that by remov-

ing the obstacle they could free people to walk who are otherwise

forced to drive.
Another study (20) used a mapping exercise to locate specific
environmental safety concerns and similarly concluded with recom-
mendations that focused on traffic safety. By emphasizing opportu-
nity-related, environmental barriers, much school travel research
assumes that parents generally want to walk their children to school,
neglecting other possible perspectives and attitudes that intervention
might address.


Other active travel research calls attention to personal factors
such as sociodemographic characteristics and attitudes (3, 4, 14, 18,
21) and recommends multiple intervention approaches in terms of
87

88
one or more segments of the target population. For example, Sener
et al. (4) found that Texas bicyclists generally chose to ride for exer-
cise reasons. However, some riders were concerned about safety,
particularly older riders and riders who did not have appropriate sign-
age or storage facilities along their routes. Akar and Clifton (22)
used principal components analysis to incorporate attitudes into
a choice model. Although their findings did not focus on segments
of the audience, they included several focus areas for intervention,
including traffic conditions, mechanical problems, way-finding,
lighting, and security. Beirao and Cabral (23) used factor and cluster
analysis on a Likert-scaled survey to identify seven broad perspec-
tives about transportation, including need for control, status seeking,
desire to change the form of transportation, pro public transporta-
tion, desire to help the environment, and sensitivity to travel stress.
Although they did not make specific policy recommendations, they
used the study to examine attitudinal differences between men and
women with regard to transportation and suggested that behavioral
policy should focus on attitudes that can induce change. By describ-
ing travel behavior and perspectives in terms of various segments of
the population, research supports a tailored approach to intervention
that may increase its impact.
Travel-related planning research often uses statistical methods
and choice modeling to describe the travel behaviors and percep-

tions of large populations or of certain sociodemographic sub-
groups of large populations. For example, Sener et al. (4) used survey
data from 1,605 bicyclists from 100 cities across Texas. Akar and
Clifton (22) used data from an online survey with more than 1,500
people on the University of Maryland campus. Beirao and Cabral
(23) used data from 3,009 telephone interviews with residents from
the Porto region of Portugal. Although some planning problems
relate to large populations better than others, statistical studies fun-
damentally require large respondent pools to make claims within
certain confidence intervals.

Even studies focused on school travel, a seemingly small-scale
planning problem, generally rely on large samples to ensure valid-
ity. For example, McDonald (11) used data from the National
Household Transportation Surveys from 1969 to 2001. Martin and
Carlson (12) analyzed data from the 2004 Consumer Styles Survey
(n = 4,213). Hillman et al.’s (16) study included surveys of students
in five areas of England. DiGuiseppi (10) surveyed 31 schools and
had 2,086 respondents. In contrast to those studies, Joshi and
MacLean (17 ) interviewed only 378 students. However, their sam-
ple represented schools in several cities and shires around Oxford,
United Kingdom, and was not intended to describe behavior at a
single school. Of the examples described above, only Collins and
Kearns (20) surveyed parents from a single primary school but had
an impressive pool of 426 respondents because it was the largest
school in Auckland, New Zealand. This is significant because it
means the research often estimates the behavioral profiles of very
broad populations but provides guidance to interventions that target
small, specific subgroups of people. That practice raises the ques-
tion of what types of behavioral profiles would be encountered with
the smaller groups and how those profiles might direct behavioral
intervention.


RESEARCH METHODS

This study used Q technique to examine parents’ perceptions of
travel alternatives for trips to and from an elementary school in Den-
ver. Q technique is a research method for systematically exploring
Transportation Research Record 2213
patterns and connections between people’s perceptions (24–28).
Similar to traditional attitude-based research, it combines psycho-
metric and operational principles with correlation techniques. The
method was introduced in 1935 by physicist–psychologist William
Stephenson as an alternative to the traditional scientific method that
would help him examine research subjects’ points of view about a
topic (25).
Q technique can be used for extensive studies that aim to identify
a range of viewpoints in a population but is oriented toward intensive
behavioral analysis of individuals or small groups of subjects (27,
28). In contrast to traditional survey methods, the purpose of Q tech-
nique is to establish the taxonomy of views rather than to weigh them
against each other in occurrence or to generalize them beyond the
scope of the study population. As a result, Q technique does not
require a large randomized sample of respondents, which makes it
ideal for small-scale research (27, 29). Brown (26) argued that even
for extensive studies, the number of respondents should not exceed
40. Addams and Proops (29, p. 21) explained the scope of sampling
for an extensive Q study:

As a consequence of the expectation of finite diversity, the number of
participants does not have to be large. What is required is that these
should be deliberately selected to reflect the widest range of potential
types of opinions in order to identify all factors [perspectives] that exist
in relation to the topic of research. (29)

Although Q technique has been used extensively in psychology,
policy sciences, and numerous other research fields, it has had little
exposure in transportation planning. Therefore, the next section of
this paper describes the method used in this study in detail, including
data collection and analysis procedures.



Data Collection

Q Sort Exercise

A Q sort exercise was the main tool used in this study to measure
parents’ perspectives of travel alternatives for school trips. The
exercise asked them to rate 36 statements on a continuum from “I
agree with these statements the most” to “I disagree with these
statements the most.” Each parent represented his or her complete
perspective by organizing the statements in a normalized distribu-
tion single centered around a mean score of zero (see Figure 1). By
imposing that distribution, the Q sort compelled parents to consider
the statements in relation to each other, rather than rating them inde-
pendently, and made it possible to evaluate each parent’s perspective
as a whole (26, 27, 29, 30).


Q Set

Q sort findings are based on permutations of the set of statements
(Q set) included in the sorting exercise. Therefore, Q methodolo-
gists recommend that the Q set represent a wide range of issues
and policy angles commonly discussed about the topic of interest.
Additionally, the Q set should use language familiar to respondents
and should be small enough to be manageable for a short sorting
activity (26, 27, 29).
The Q set for this study included statements obtained through
content analysis of semistructured interviews with 65 parents from
11 Denver elementary schools that were part of a larger study. In

Site Selection

This paper focuses on findings from research conducted at Edison
Elementary School, one of 11 study sites from a larger research proj-
ect investigating school travel in Denver. Edison was selected as a
research site based on its participation in Denver’s 2007 through
2008 grant-funded Safe Routes to School noninfrastructure pro-
gram, which indicated the school’s interest in increasing the propor-
tion of trips made by walking or biking. The school’s participation
in Safe Routes to School also facilitated access to key informants,
which included school staff and parents.
The purpose of this research was to examine perceptions of travel
alternatives with a small, culturally diverse population. At the time
of study, Edison’s student body was divided almost evenly between
white and Latino students and had nearly one-half of enrolled stu-
dents on a free and reduced price lunch program, indicating financial
need. Edison’s sociodemographic composition made it an appropri-
ate study site to explore the use of Q technique as an alternative to
traditional survey methods.

Participant Selection

Q sorts were distributed to every household through Edison’s take-
home folder system and returned through its administrative office.
In addition to the Q sorts, parents received a short questionnaire
about personal and household sociodemographic and travel behav-
ior characteristics and two open-format questions asking them to
explain their perspectives. Each completed Q sort was coded to ensure
anonymity and matched to a contact sheet with parents’ and teachers’
names, phone numbers, and classrooms to eliminate duplicate entries
from families with multiple children.
At the time of the study, Edison had 461 enrolled students. A total
of 161 respondents, representing 278 students, returned the Q sorts
(minus 33 incomplete responses)—a net 60.3% response rate. While
this number of respondents would suffice for a traditional statistical
study, it was much larger than necessary for Q technique and required
an additional sampling strategy to limit the total number of cases
while reflecting the widest range of relevant perspectives.
Distributing the Q sort widely made it possible to purposefully
select a small number of participant cases based on a series of
characteristics relevant to travel behavior. From the overall respon-
dent pool, 39 cases were selected for cluster analysis based on char-
acteristics that made the parents theoretically more likely to walk
or bike their children to school. For example, the study included
parents who indicated that they lived less than 10 blocks from the
school, that they were not assigned to a route in the school’s bus
system, and that they did not have children in early childhood
education or kindergarten. On the basis of this sampling strategy,
study results would guide policy to focus attention on the “low-
hanging fruit”—perspectives of parents whose circumstances
(opportunity-related conditions) favored walking or biking—and
would thereby increase the potency of intervention by addressing
propensity-related issues.
The resulting Q sample included the sociodemographic diversity
of the larger school population in terms of race and income, although
the numbers were not proportionally representative. The sample was
intentionally weighted in favor of households living nearer to the
school, which resulted in a greater proportion of white families with
higher household incomes. Despite the shorter distance between
home and school, a greater proportion of the selected cases drove at
Transportation Research Record 2213
least one way than in the larger respondent pool. This made it
important in the final stage to correlate factors to the larger respon-
dent pool to determine how well each of the perspectives resonated
overall.


Data Analysis and Interpretation

Several types of specialized freeware are available to collect and
analyze Q sort data, including PQMethod, PCQ, FlashQ, and WebQ.
Their procedures and advantages are described in detail elsewhere
(32, 33). This study used the more conventional statistical software
SPSS 17.0 but used case-wise analytical techniques, which extracted
several core types of perspectives from the 39 selected Q sort cases
and correlated them with the larger respondent pool. Brunner and Lyn
(34) provide a detailed explanation of the advantages of case-wise
versus factor-wise analysis. Procedures for this study’s analysis are
described in detail below.

Identifying Factors

Q sort data were entered in table format with case numbers in the
first column and sorting scores for each of the 36 statements (-4 to
+4) in the remaining columns. They were analyzed in SPSS 17.0
using hierarchical clustering with Pearson’s correlation coefficient
and the complete linkage algorithm. (Hierarchical cluster analysis
was possible without further normalization because respondents
were instructed to complete the Q sort exercise using a normalized,
single-centered diagram.) This step produced a table of correlation
coefficients to indicate the degree of similarity (between 0 and
±1.00, with +1.00 indicating an exact match) when each new case
joined a cluster. It also produced an icicle dendrogram, which graph-
ically presented the clustering of cases, and rescaled the correlations
to indicate the degree of difference between clusters (0 to 25, with
25 indicating the least similar). These initial results were instrumen-
tal in deciding the number of factors and in identifying their member
cases (see Figure 2).
To identify factors, it was necessary to locate significant divisions
between shared perspectives. As indicated by the dashed boxes on
the dendrogram, the first clear division occurred at about Level 24
on the distance scale (r = -.344), between the top 26 cases and the
bottom 13 cases. The top group showed three additional divisions at
Levels 22, 17, and 13, potentially indicating four meaningful factors
or shared perspectives. However, because Cases 35 and 37 combine
at r = .231, it was assumed that their shared perspective would be
too weak to include as an independent factor. Further analysis veri-
fied that interpretation, as the two cases shared a strong opinion
about only one statement. That meant the top group was divided into
three factors (labeled A, B, and C) with clusters of nine, eight, and
seven member cases each. The bottom group showed a clear divi-
sion at about level 19 (r = -.084), making two factors (D and E) with
clusters of five and eight member cases each. Characterization of the
five factors reinforced this structure as described below.


Characterizing Factors

To characterize each of the five factors, scores for each of the 36 state-
ments were calculated from the means of the scores of the factors’
member cases (see Table 2). Each factor’s profile was represented

Perspective A. Optimistic Walkers

Optimistic walkers were enthusiastic about active travel. They
emphasized their desire for physical activity (Statements 18 to 20).
They mentioned psychological, health, and academic motivations
for walking (Statements 6, 17, and 22). They also mentioned social
environmental opportunities, such as trustworthy adults (Statements
12 and 33) and children (Statement 15) as well as physical environ-
mental opportunities for active travel, such as safe walking routes and
mild climate (Statements 27 and 28).
Shared by 24.2% of the larger body of respondents, this was by far
the most common perspective for respondents living within six blocks
of the school and was the second most favored for those living between
seven and 10 blocks away. Close proximity to the school influenced

its demographic profile to include a higher proportion of white fam-
ilies than all but one other subgroup (fair-weather walkers). This sub-

group also ranked second after fair-weather walkers in terms of

wealth, with 46.2% of the subgroup reporting annual household

incomes greater than $72,000.

This group practiced what it preached. A significant proportion

(64.1%) of this subgroup reported walking on nice days, and it was

most common for those who reported walking overall. It was also

favored by respondents who reported their children traveled with
siblings or friends. However, nearly one-quarter of respondents in
this subgroup reported carpooling (23.1%), which may account for
the higher companionship. Despite its emphasis on walking, about
one-third (35.5%) of this subgroup reported driving both ways and
nearly one-half (46.2%) reported dropping children off on the way
to work, which may or may not indicate car travel. These statistics
indicate that even within populations who walk, policy can aim to
increase rates of active travel.
An appropriate intervention approach to address this perspective
would be to monitor each student’s trips made by walking or biking
(either by self-report or by electronic tracking) and reward students
each week or each month for the highest number or longest consecu-
tive number of walking or biking trips to school. Rewards may include
small consumer items, entries into contests, or schoolwide recognition.


Perspective B. Fair-Weather Walkers

Fair-weather walkers were generally positive about active travel but
recognized the convenience of car travel. They emphasized their desire
for physical activity (Statements 18 and 19) as well as an academic
motivation for active travel (Statement 22). They also emphasized the
safety of parents driving with children (Statement 31), which might
be interpreted to support walking or driving, in this context. They
mentioned social opportunities, including neighborhood children and
trustworthy adults (Statements 10 and 12) and the environmental
opportunity presented by a mild climate (Statement 28). In contrast to
their generally positive attitude toward active travel, they mentioned
the convenience of car travel (Statement 5).
Shared by 29.2% of the larger body of respondents, this was the
most common perspective for respondents living farther than 10 blocks
from the school and the most preferred overall. The demographic com-
position of this perspective’s subgroup was most remarkable in terms
of wealth. Overall, it was the most common perspective for respon-
dents who reported earning annual household incomes greater than
$72,000 and least common for those earning less than $36,000. It had
the second highest proportion of white respondents after the optimistic
walkers.
Despite this perspective’s positive attitude about active travel, it
was most preferred for respondents who reported driving both direc-
93
tions or driving one way and walking the other. About one-quarter of
this subgroup (25.5%) reported carpooling, and just over one-half
(53.2%) dropped children off at school on the way to work. Although
it ranked lower than the other perspectives for active travel, about
one-third of this subgroup (34.0%) reported walking on nice days.
Biking instruction, storage facilities, and route maps would be
appropriate to encourage students and parents with this perspective to
use active travel modes and to become more familiar with safe paths
between home and school. Emphasis on biking would make the trip
less time-consuming than walking, addressing the greater travel
distance common to the group.



Perspective C. Drivers of Necessity


Drivers of necessity described walking or biking to school as a lux-

ury that would proffer certain benefits but that was difficult to attain.

They emphasized saving money (Statement 25) and mentioned aca-

demics (Statement 22) as well as environmental stewardship (State-

ment 26) as motivations for walking. They also mentioned their

desire for physical activity (Statements 18 and 19) and environmen-

tal opportunities for walking, such as safe routes (Statement 27) and

a mild climate (Statement 28). In contrast, they mentioned parents’
time constraints (Statement 3), defended parents’ ability to drive
safely with children (Statement 31), and argued against children’s
ability to handle the trip alone (Statement 16).
The composition of this subgroup was not remarkable in terms of
ethnicity or in distance from the school. However, shared by 13.0%
of the larger body of respondents, this was the most common per-
spective for respondents reporting an annual combined household
income less than $12,000. Income levels were more evenly distrib-
uted within this subgroup than they were in the others, with about
one-fifth (19.0%) reporting less than $12,000 and about one-sixth
(14.3%) reporting more than $72,000.
Most travel behaviors for this subgroup were about average for
the larger respondent population. About one-half (52.4%) of this
subgroup reported driving both ways, about one-half (52.4%)
reported walking on nice days, more than one-quarter (28.6%)
reported walking one direction and driving the other, and more than
one-third (38.1%) took children to school on the way to work. This
subgroup was average in terms of children traveling with siblings
or friends.
Walking school buses would be an appropriate intervention to
address this perspective, because parents could alternate responsi-
bility for traveling a short segment of each trip, rather than taking
responsibility for the entire trip twice each day. Since this group
emphasized environmental stewardship and saving money on gas,
it may also be appropriate to focus marketing campaigns on these
issues. For example, the school might count walking and biking
trips each month, calculate fuel and emissions savings associated
with those trips, and present the findings in newsletters or on a
banner at the school.


Perspective D. Determined Drivers

Determined drivers dismissed walking or biking to school as diffi-
cult and unnecessary travel alternatives. They emphasized dangerous
drivers (Statement 32) and bullies in the neighborhood (Statement
36) and claimed that the location of the school did not influence
where they chose to live (Statement 21). They also mentioned par-
ents’ time constraints (Statements 1 and 3) as well as children’s

94
inability to negotiate the trip to school alone (Statement 16). Although
this group mentioned a social environmental opportunity presented
by trustworthy adults in the neighborhood (Statement 12), they
appeared to introduce it as a support of carpooling rather than active
travel. Their only expression supporting physical activity related to a
concern about children’s obesity (Statement 17).
This perspective was shared by 11.2% of the larger body of
respondents and was least favored overall. Similar to the drivers
of necessity, the demographic composition of this subgroup was
not remarkable in terms of ethnicity or in distance from the
school. The income distribution is roughly average for the larger
population.
One-half of this subgroup (50.0%) reported driving both directions,
and almost one-quarter (22.2%) reported walking on nice days, although
this perspective was not the most common for either characteristic. In
fact, it was the least preferred perspective for parents claiming to walk
on nice days (6.3%). Also, a smaller than average proportion (33.3%)
reported dropping children off on the way to work.
Intervention to address this core perspective should concentrate on
overcoming negative attitudes about active travel, in particular distin-
guishing the benefits of walking and biking to school from other forms
of physical activity (i.e., extracurricular sports and physical education
programs). For example, active commuting offers an excellent source
of cardiopulmonary and bone-strengthening exercise and can easily
be incorporated or maintained during adult life.



Perspective E. Fence Sitters

Fence sitters described benefits afforded by walking and by driving

and did not commit to either travel mode. They mentioned their

desire for physical activity (Statements 18 and 20) and expressed

that walking is more enjoyable than driving (Statement 6). They

mentioned an environmental opportunity for walking presented by

safe routes in the neighborhood (Statement 27). However, they also

mentioned concern for children’s ability to negotiate the trip alone
(Statement 16) and several social and environmental obstacles to
active travel, such as unsafe drivers, strangers, and bullies (State-
ments 32, 33, and 36) and unsafe crossings (Statement 29). In fur-
ther support of driving, they described it as convenient (Statement
5) and argued that parents drive children safely (Statement 31) and
that they are not concerned about obesity (Statement 17).
Shared by 17.4% of the larger body of respondents, this was the
most common perspective for Hispanic parents and for those who
reported combined annual household incomes between $12,000
and $36,000. This perspective stands out because, unlike the larger
population of respondents, it was evenly distributed among the four
distances from the school and between the two dominant racial and
ethnic groups.
This was among the least common perspectives for respondents
who reported walking on nice days and for those who reported walk-
ing one way and driving the other. Proportions of this subgroup were
also significantly lower than average for children traveling with sib-
lings or friends (3.6%), for carpooling (3.6%), and for driving both
directions (46.4%). It reported average proportions of parents dropping
children off on the way to work (42.9%).
An appropriate intervention to address this perspective would be
a walking buddy program to encourage students to travel with one or
more friends in their neighborhood. Similar to a walking school bus,
walking buddies would make students more visible to drivers at road
crossings and would provide safety in numbers for students who

walk near adult strangers or other groups of young people. The walk-
ing buddy program should also provide defensive instruction to the
students, helping them to first avoid but also respond appropriately
to threatening social situations.


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Travel behavior research often uses statistical techniques that require
large data sets and that aim to capture the central tendencies and
behavioral influences of large populations or segments thereof. Those
methods are effective for guiding large-scale interventions because
they focus attention on the few key environmental factors that
are strongly associated with travel behavioral trends and that might
be manipulated through urban design or planning initiatives.
However, the same techniques may be less effective at guiding
school-based active travel programs. Individual schools’ enrollments
are too diverse to narrowly focus intervention on central behavioral
tendencies. Yet, they are too small to use traditional statistical meth-
ods of audience segmentation based on sociodemographic groupings.
A research approach is needed that can target intervention to the
diverse perceptions of the school commute that occur within individual
schools.
The purpose of this study was to explore the use of Q technique
for assessing perceptions of travel alternatives with small populations
that planners might target for behavioral intervention. The main data
collection tool for the study was a Q sort exercise composed of
36 statements about a wide range of issues relating to school travel.
Q sorts completed by parents at Edison Elementary School were ana-
lyzed first by case-wise cluster analysis (n = 39) and then by correla-

tion with the larger respondent pool (n = 161). Results indicated five

core perspectives that guided the selection of several intervention

approaches appropriate to the school’s diverse community.

The intervention approaches recommended by this study primarily

focus on improving perceptions of active school travel, with secondary

attention to route safety. In that respect, the recommendations contrast
with some active travel programs, which conflate intervention to
encourage walking or biking with intervention to improve route safety.
(For example, the Safe Routes to School programs emphasize improv-
ing route safety to encourage pedestrian activity.) This paper empha-
sizes that the two objectives (more active commuting and safer routes)
are discrete while upholding the relevance of both types of interven-
tion. The propensity-related focus of this study’s recommendations
reflects findings that in all but one core perspective parents agreed that
there were already safe routes to walk or bike between their homes and
the school. Despite the opportunity to walk safely, many parents chose
to drive children one or both ways to school.
Similar to the traditional large-scale quantitative active travel
research, this study describes travel behavior in terms of an assort-
ment of environmental and personal correlates. For example, both
approaches acknowledge the possible influence of dangerous street
crossings, strangers, and time constraints in parents’ decisions about
travel mode. However, in contrast to traditional research, this study
emphasizes differences in the ways parents experience and prioritize
those correlates and targets intervention based on those differences.
The intervention approaches could be applied independently or as
part of a multifaceted active travel program. They should be adminis-
tered broadly (by grade level or schoolwide) rather than targeting
sociodemographic or geographic subgroups of the population. While
certain core perspectives were favored by respondents living a cer-
tain distance from the school or from a certain racial or ethnic
background or income level, they were not defined by those factors

intervention and public awareness.

First, although parents were assigned to the core perspective with        12.
which they correlated most strongly, most parents also correlated
with other perspectives to a lesser degree. That suggests that while
a single perspective-based intervention approach might resonate               13.
most strongly with the 15% to 25% of parents included in its sub-

group, it would still affect other parents, overlapping the spheres of
influence for each intervention.                                              14.
Second, the study assumed that parents largely determined their
children’s travel mode for school trips. Because the research iden-
tified parents’ perspectives of travel alternatives (as opposed to            15.

students’ perspectives), activities and outcomes related to interven-
tions would need to be directly observable by or reported to parents
to affect their decisions about school travel. A broadly adminis-
tered, multifaceted active travel program would be likely to gain the         16.

attention and participation of parents.

Q technique as described in this study provides a fine-grained
assessment of travel behavior for small populations that may benefit
small-scale behavioral interventions. To be clear, that does not mean         18.
