Australian children’s independent mobility levels: secondary analyses of
cross-sectional data between 1991 and 2012
       This study investigated changes in Australian children’s independent mobility levels
       between1991 and 2012. Data from <U+FB01>ve cross-sectional studies conducted in 1991, 1993,
       2010, 2011 and 2012 were analysed. Parent and child surveys were used to assess parental
       licences for independent mobility and actual independent mobility behaviour in children
       aged 8–13 years. Findings show declines in the proportion of young children (=10 years of
       age) being allowed to travel home from school alone (1991: 68%, 1993: 50%, 2010: 43%,
       2011: 45%, 2012: 31%) and travel on buses alone (1991: 31%, 1993: 15%, 2010: 8%, 2011:
       6%, 2012: 9%). Furthermore, the proportion of children travelling independently to school
       decreased (1991: 61%, 1993: 42%, 2010: 31%, 2011: 32%, 2012: 32%). Signi<U+FB01>cantly fewer
       girls than boys travelled independently to school at each time point (p = .001). Overall, the
       <U+FB01>ndings suggest that Australian children’s independent mobility levels declined between
       1991 and 2012.
Introduction
Child independent mobility describes the freedom of those aged under 18 years to travel to places
without adult supervision (Hillman, Adams, and Whitelegg 1990; Whitzman and Mizrachi 2009).
For children, independent travel usually involves active modes of travel such as walking and
cycling, but also public transport (Carver et al. 2010b). Independent mobility is typically
expressed as parental licence (i.e. permission) for unsupervised mobility and actual mobility behaviour. Usually, children’s independent mobility licences increase between the ages of 8 and 13
years when parents recognise greater physical and cognitive capabilities in their children as they
age (Whitzman and Mizrachi 2009; Carver et al. 2010b). Boys tend to have higher independent
mobility levels than girls. This is demonstrated by boys having more licences for travelling to
places and taking public transport without adult accompaniment (Mackett et al. 2007; Brown et al.
2008; Page et al. 2009; Carver et al. 2010b).
    In developed countries such as England and Germany, trend data have shown that children’s
unsupervised walking and cycling for transport have dramatically declined in the last four decades
(Shaw et al. 2013). Reasons for this decline include increased motorised traf<U+FB01>c, decreased neighbourhood walkability, parental safety concerns, busy family schedules and longer commute distances to school and leisure-time destinations (Tranter and Whitelegg 1994; Bringolf-Isler et al.
2008; Carver et al. 2010b; McDonald, Deakin, and Aalborg 2010; Ding et al. 2011). Declines in
walking and cycling for transport have been accelerated as more parents choose to keep their children ‘safe’ by driving them to school and other locations, hence increasing the risk for remaining
child pedestrians and cyclists. In Australia, several studies (Peddie and Somerville 2006; Van der
Ploeg et al. 2008; Garrard 2009) have shown a decline in children’s walking and cycling for transport. For example, trend data from New South Wales showed that between 1971 and 2003, the
proportion of children who walked to school decreased from 58% to 26%, whilst the proportion
being driven increased from 23% to 67% (Van der Ploeg et al. 2008). The decline in Australian
children’s active travel suggests that their independent mobility has also declined. However, children’s active travel is not a suf<U+FB01>cient marker for determining independent mobility, as children
may walk and cycle to places with adults. More explicit measurement of independent travel is
needed to accurately determine Australian children’s independent mobility levels. Recent
cross-sectional studies assessed children’s independent active travel and found that only about
a third of children aged 10–13 years commute independently to school by means of walking,
cycling or using a scooter or skateboard (Rudner and Malone 2011; Carver et al. 2014; Schoeppe
et al. 2014). However, unlike in other developed countries, temporal changes in Australian children’s independent mobility levels have not been explored.
    To address this research gap, the present study investigates changes in Australian children’s
independent mobility licences and behaviour between 1991 and 2012, and differences in changes
in independent mobility levels by child age and gender.
Methods
Secondary data analyses were employed using data from <U+FB01>ve Australian cross-sectional studies
conducted in 1991, 1993, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The studies were selected based on comparable
data available for study populations and measures used to assess child independent mobility
licences and behaviour. In all studies, the study populations were Australian primary school children and their parents. Children’s age and gender were comparable across the studies; most children were between 8 and 13 years old with a mean age of around 10 years (Table 1). The study
samples and measures of independent mobility licences and behaviour used in the secondary analyses are presented below.
Study samples
Canberra 1991
The 1991 Children’s Mobility in Canberra study investigated children’s independent mobility in the
context of traf<U+FB01>c danger, transport infrastructures, land-use patterns and parental safety concerns
(Tranter and Whitelegg 1994). Convenience samples of 1360 parents and 1273 children aged 8–13 years were used in this analysis. The participants were recruited from 13 primary schools
(Years 4–6) in Canberra and the nearby town of Queanbeyan (Tranter 1993). The schools were
located in inner, middle and outer suburbs of Canberra (Australian Capital Territory) and
Queanbeyan (New South Wales) which is functionally part of Canberra. The study was endorsed by
the Catholic Education Of<U+FB01>ce and the ACT Ministry for Health, Education and the Arts. Written
consent for study participation was obtained from school principals, parents and children.
Sydney 1993
The 1993 Children’s Mobility in Sydney study was a replication of the 1991 Canberra study
(Tranter 1993). Convenience samples of 298 parents and 476 children aged 8–12 years were
included in this analysis. The participants were recruited from four primary schools (Years 4–6) located in the Sutherland area of Sydney, New South Wales (Tranter 1996). The schools in
both Canberra and Sydney were all relatively low-density suburbs, despite their city location.
The research was approved by the NSW Department of Education. Written consent for study participation was obtained from school principals, parents and children.
Melbourne 2010
The 2010 Children’s Independent Mobility Study investigated children’s independent mobility
licences and behaviour with a particular focus on urban/rural differences in children’s independent mobility, associations between mobility licences and children’s independent mobility, and
potential correlates of mobility licences (Carver, Timperio, and Crawford 2012). Random
samples of 341 parents and 421 children aged 8–13 years were included in this analysis. The participants were recruited from nine primary schools (Years 3–6) based in Melbourne, the small
town of Gisborne and the rural towns of Korumburra and Kyneton, Victoria. The schools were
located in inner city (n = 2), urban (n = 1), suburban (n = 1), small town (n = 1) and rural areas
(n = 3) (Carver, Timperio, and Crawford 2012). Ethical clearance for the study was obtained
from the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Department of Education
and Early Childhood Development, Victoria. Written consent for study participation was received
from school principals, parents and children.
Sydney 2011
The 2011 Child Friendly Communities Research and Community Engagement Project investigated
children’s independent school travel, licences for independent mobility and parental perceptions of
neighbourhood safety (Rudner and Malone 2011). Convenience samples of 113 parents and 131
children aged 8–13 years were included in this analysis. They were recruited from three primary
schools (Years 4–6) based in the suburbs of South Cronulla in the Sutherland Shire (close to the
sites of the 1993 Sydney study); and Bulli, a suburb in the city of Wollongong; and Dapto, a
small town at the southernmost edge of the sprawl of Sydney suburbia (Rudner and Malone
2011). Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from the University of Wollongong,
and written consent for study participation was provided from school principals, parents and
children.
Rockhampton, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth 2012
The 2012 Children’s Activity, Travel, Connectedness and Health (CATCH) and Independent
Mobility, Active Travel and Children’s Health (iMATCH) projects were interrelated studies to
examine the role of policy, social and built environments in in<U+FB02>uencing children’s independent
mobility, active travel and related health outcomes (Curtin University 2015). Convenience
samples of 301 parents and 305 children aged 8–13 years were included in analyses. They
were recruited from nine primary schools (Years 3–7) in Rockhampton, Brisbane, Melbourne
and Perth areas. The schools were located in inner urban (n = 2), middle suburban (n = 2),
outer suburban (n = 2) and regional areas (n = 3) (Schoeppe et al. 2014). Given that city-related
built environment factors were not the focus of analyses, it was not needed to disaggregate the
CATCH/iMATCH data by city. Ethical clearance for conducting the CATCH/iMATCH projects
was obtained from several universities (Central Queensland University, The University of Melbourne, Curtin University and Grif<U+FB01>th University) and State Departments of Education and Training in Australia (Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia). Written consent for study participation
was obtained from school principals, parents and children.
Measures
Paper-based child and parent surveys with almost identical questions were utilised in the 1991,
1993, 2010, 2011 and 2012 studies (Tranter 1993, 1996; Tranter and Whitelegg 1994; Rudner
and Malone 2011; Carver, Timperio, and Crawford 2012; Schoeppe et al. 2014). The child questionnaires were <U+FB01>lled out at school; the parent surveys were completed at home and returned to the
researchers via mail or a letterbox at school. A detailed description of the measures used in each
study is provided in the appendix. In summary, parental licences for child independent mobility
were assessed using six items. First, parents reported whether their child is usually allowed to
‘come home from school alone’, ‘travel on buses, trams, trains or other public transport (other
than a school bus) alone’ and ‘cross main suburban roads alone’. Response options were yes
and no. Second, parents were asked to report at what age they would allow their child to
‘travel home from school alone’, ‘travel on buses alone’ and ‘cross main suburban roads
alone’. Child age, gender and independent mobility behaviour were measured through the
child surveys. Child independent mobility behaviour was assessed using two items. Children
reported their ‘travel mode to school’ and ‘accompaniment to school’. Response options for
‘travel mode to school’ included walking/cycling/taking the scooter, public transport and car.
Response categories for ‘accompaniment to school’ were alone, with other children and with
an adult. Children travelling to school alone or with other children were considered independently
mobile and those commuting to school with an adult were considered not independently mobile.
There are no standardised, validated measures available for assessing child independent mobility
licences and behaviour. The survey measures used in each of the <U+FB01>ve studies included in the ana-
lyses were based on the original research questionnaires used in the Hillman, Adams, and White-
legg (1990) study in England and Germany.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive analyses were used to assess child age, gender and prevalence of independent mobility licences and behaviour in each of the <U+FB01>ve study samples. Independent mobility licences were
investigated for all children included in the samples and by child age. Independent mobility behaviour was examined for all children included in the samples and by child gender. Chi-square
tests were used to assess differences in independent mobility behaviour by child gender. The signi<U+FB01>cance level was set at 0.05. Analyses were performed in IBM SPSS Statistics (version 21.0).
Results
Independent mobility licences observed in the 1991, 1993, 2010, 2011 and 2012 studies are presented in Table 2. In Australian children aged 8–13 years, licences for ‘travelling home from
school’, ‘travelling on buses’ and ‘crossing main roads’ varied greatly across the studies and
no temporal change was immediately apparent, except for ‘crossing main roads’. Higher proportions of children were allowed to cross main roads alone in 2010, 2011 and 2012 than in
1991 and 1993. However, in-depth analyses of independent mobility licences by child age
revealed that lower proportions of young children were granted independent mobility licences
in 2010, 2011 and 2012 than in 1991 and 1993. For example, in the 1991 and 1993 studies,
68% and 50% of children aged =10 years were allowed to travel home from school alone,
whereas in the 2010, 2011 and 2012 studies, these proportion were 43%, 45% and 31%, respectively. Similarly, in the 1991 and 1993 studies, 31% and 15% of =10-year-olds were allowed to
travel on buses alone, whereas in the 2010, 2011 and 2012 studies, these proportion were 8%, 6%
and 9%, respectively.
      Levels of independent mobility behaviour observed in the 1991, 1993, 2010, 2011 and 2012
studies are presented in Table 3. Findings suggest that Australian children’s independent mobility
in the form of independent travel to school declined in the last 20 years. In the 1991 and 1993
studies, the proportions of children travelling independently (alone or with other children) to
school were 61% and 42%, respectively. In contrast, in the 2010, 2011 and 2012 studies, these
proportions were 31%, 32% and 32%, respectively.
      Signi<U+FB01>cant gender differences were found in relation to children’s independent travel to
school (Table 3). In the 1991, 1993 and 2010 studies, the proportions of children travelling
alone to school were signi<U+FB01>cantly lower in girls than in boys (18% vs. 32% in 1991; 11% vs. 26%
in 1993; 8% vs. 20% in 2010, 3% vs. 17% in 2011; p = .001). In the 2012 study, the proportion of
children travelling alone to school was also lower in girls than in boys; however, the gender difference was not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (17% vs. 24%; p = .339).
     The decline in children’s independent travel to school observed between 1991 and 2012 is
illustrated in Figure 1. Evidently, fewer girls than boys travelled independently to school at
each study time point. Australian children’s active travel to school has also declined between
1991 and 2012; however, the decline is not consistent across all studies (Table 3). The proportions
of children who commuted actively to school were 52% and 38% in the 1991 and 1993 studies,
compared to 28% and 35% in the 2011 and 2012 studies. In contrast, in the 2010 study, the proportion of children commuting actively to school was 42% which is lower than in the 1991 study,
but higher than in the 1993 study.
Discussion
This study investigated changes in Australian children’s independent mobility levels between
1991 and 2012, including differences by child age and gender. Parental licences for independent
mobility and actual independent mobility behaviour were assessed using secondary data from <U+FB01>ve
cross-sectional studies conducted in 1991, 1993, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Overall, <U+FB01>ndings suggest
that Australian children’s independent mobility levels have declined in the last 20 years. Fewer
young children (= 10 years of age) were allowed to travel home from school alone and travel
on buses alone in 2010, 2011and 2012 than in 1991 and 1993. Moreover, fewer children travelled
to school alone or with other children in 2010, 2011 and 2012 than in 1991 and 1993. Children’s
independent travel to school differed by gender; signi<U+FB01>cantly fewer girls than boys travelled independently to school in 1991, 1993, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Australian children’s active travel to
school has also declined between 1991 and 2012; however, the decline is not consistent across
all studies.
     Australian children’s independent mobility licences declined among younger children. Whilst
in 1991 and 1993 68% and 50% of children aged = 10 years were allowed to travel home from
school alone, these proportions were 43%, 45% and 31% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.
Similarly, in 1991 and 1993, 31% and 15% of =10-year-olds were allowed to travel on buses
alone, whereas in 2010, 2011 and 2012, these proportions were only 8%, 6% and 9%, respectively. Our <U+FB01>ndings are consistent with trend data on independent mobility licences reported for
primary school children in England and Germany (Shaw et al. 2013). For example, in English
children aged 7–11 years, independent mobility licences for travelling home from school alone
decreased from 35% in 1990 to 25% in 2010 (Shaw et al. 2013). Their licences for travelling
on buses alone also declined from 7% in 1990 to 5% in 2010 (Shaw et al. 2013). Similarly, in
German children aged 7–11 years, independent mobility licences for travelling home from
school alone dropped from 93% in 1990 to 76% in 2010; and their licences for travelling on
buses alone decreased from 61% in 1990 to 25% in 2010 (Shaw et al. 2013).
    An unexpected <U+FB01>nding in our study was that more children were granted licences allowing
them to cross main roads alone in 2010, 2011 and 2012 (55%, 42% and 55%) than in 1991
and 1993 (21% and 20%). A similar increase was observed in English primary school children:
36% of children aged 7–11 years were allowed to cross main roads in 2010 compared to 22% in
1990 (Shaw et al. 2013). In contrast, a decrease was observed in German primary school children:
66% of children aged 7–11 years were allowed to cross main roads in 2010 compared to 80% in
1990 (Shaw et al. 2013). These unexpected and inconsistent study <U+FB01>ndings are dif<U+FB01>cult to interpret. One possible explanation may be that the term ‘main road’ was interpreted differently by
parents across the studies. Another possible explanation may be that road safety has improved
over the years, making it safer for children to cross main roads. Moreover, it must be remembered
that the parental licence does not necessary equate with children’s actual independent travel
undertaken since many children were being driven to school despite the parental licence.
    Australian children’s actual independent mobility behaviour has also declined. The proportion
of children travelling independently (alone or with other children) to school decreased from 61%
in 1991 and 42% in 1993 to 31% in 2010, 32% in 2011 and 32% in 2012. Our <U+FB01>ndings are consistent with trend data on children’s independent travel to school in other developed countries
(Fyhri et al. 2011; Shaw et al. 2013). In England, 36% of primary school children aged 7–11
years travelled independently to school in 1990, whereas in 2010, this proportion had dropped
to 23% (Shaw et al. 2013). Similar data from Great Britain showed that 22% of children aged
7–10 years travelled independently to school in 2002 compared to 14% in 2008 (Fyhri et al.
2011). In Germany, children’s independent travel to school also declined from over 60% in
1990 to under 20% in 2010; however, the decline was mainly observed in relation to the proportion of children travelling to school with other children rather than alone (Shaw et al.
2013). In the overall Australian travel context, the decline in Australian children’s independent
travel to school is not surprising, given that in the last decades both active and public transport
have generally decreased in Australian households whilst commuting by car has signi<U+FB01>cantly
increased (ABS 2011).
    A gender difference in children’s independent travel to school was evident in all studies
included in analyses. Signi<U+FB01>cantly lower proportions of girls travelled alone to school than
boys (18% vs. 32% in 1991; 11% vs. 26% in 1993; 8% vs. 20% in 2010, 3% vs. 17% in
2011; 17% vs. 24% in 2012). This gender-speci<U+FB01>c <U+FB01>nding is consistent with results from previous
studies (Mackett et al. 2007; Page et al. 2009; Brown et al. 2008; Carver et al. 2010b) showing
that independent mobility levels are lower in girls than in boys. However, whilst this gender gap
narrowed between 1990 and 2010 in English primary school children (Shaw et al. 2013), our <U+FB01>ndings indicate that it remained between 1991 and 2010 in Australian primary school children, and
even widened in 2011. In 2012, the gender gap was still present though much narrower than in
previous years. Lower independent mobility levels in girls are concerning from a health perspective because they contribute to signi<U+FB01>cantly lower physical activity levels observed in girls compared to boys (Van Mechelen and Kemper 1995). In addition, girls’ physical activity levels
decline during adolescence (Van Mechelen 2000) when they are less inclined to participate in
competitive sports than boys (Brooks and Magnusson 2007).
     Independent mobility provides children many opportunities to accumulate physical activity
that is important for a healthy development (Loprinzi et al. 2012; Schoeppe et al. 2013). The
decline in children’s independent mobility observed in this study demonstrates the need for
public health interventions to promote independent travel in children. Interventions will require
support from parents, and expertise from urban planners and transport experts to create built
and social environments conducive to children’s independent walking, cycling and outdoor
play. Intervention measures may include active travel policies in schools and government
funding for active transport infrastructures (e.g. footpaths and cycling trails), traf<U+FB01>c calming
measures, zoning, parks and playgrounds in the community (Sallis et al. 2006; Panter, Jones,
and van Sluijs 2008). In addition, intervention measures may involve parental education on the
health and social bene<U+FB01>ts of children’s independent mobility, and the promotion of neighbour
relations and social networks that may help assure parents that the neighbourhood is a safe
place for children’s independent travel and outdoor play (Pabayo et al. 2011).
     Strengths of this research include the availability of child independent mobility data from <U+FB01>ve
different time points within two decades, and the use of comparable independent mobility
measures in child populations with homogenous age and gender. Other strengths of this research
include the distinct measurement of independent mobility licences versus actual behaviour for
assessing independent mobility levels. This is important, as children may be allowed to travel
independently to places but end up being driven because it is more convenient and compatible
with family schedules. Moreover, this research included children residing in major Australian
cities and small towns capturing diverse levels of urbanisation (inner urban, middle suburban,
outer suburban, regional and rural areas); this may support the generalisability of <U+FB01>ndings. Previous research has shown that children living in rural areas have lower independent mobility
levels than children residing in urban areas, possibly because travel distances to destinations
such as school are longer in rural than in urban areas (Carver, Timperio, and Crawford 2012).
This research also has several limitations. First, the use of cross-sectional data preclude inference
on causal mechanisms for the observed changes in child independent mobility. Built and social
environmental factors such as travel distances to school, availability of walking/cycling trails
and public transport infrastructure, street connectivity, traf<U+FB01>c volume, traf<U+FB01>c calming measures
and perceptions of safety were not considered in analyses (as comparable data were not available
from all studies). However, these environmental factors will likely have in<U+FB02>uenced temporal
changes in children’s independent mobility levels (Tranter and Whitelegg 1994; Bringolf-Isler
et al. 2008; Carver et al. 2010a; Carver, Timperio, and Crawford 2013). Therefore, the <U+FB01>ndings
from our study are only indicative of a decrease in Australian children’s independent mobility
levels between 1991 and 2012. Second, there is the possibility of selection bias due to differences
in response rates across the <U+FB01>ve cross-sectional studies. Third, the use of parental proxy and child
self-report measures might have introduced recall bias. However, child travel to school and parental licences for travel home from school, by bus and across main roads seem behaviours that are
easily remembered, hence the possibility of recall bias was likely low. This was the <U+FB01>rst study to
explicitly investigate temporal changes in Australian children’s independent mobility levels.
Future research in this area should use longitudinal data collected at regular time intervals to
detect trends in children’s independent mobility levels. Moreover, future studies should
account for important environmental determinants of child independent mobility, such as distances to travel destinations, neighbourhood walkability and road safety. To limit recall bias,
future studies could use a combination of self-report measures (child surveys, travel diaries)
and objective measures (global positioning systems, wearable cameras) to assess child indepen-
dent mobility.
    In conclusion, Australian children’s independent mobility licences declined among younger
children. Fewer children aged =10 years were allowed to travel home from school alone and
travel on buses alone in 2010, 2011 and 2012 than in 1991 and 1993. Australian children’s
actual independent mobility behaviour also declined. Fewer children travelled independently to
school in 2010, 2011 and 2012 than in 1991 and 1993. Children’s independent travel to school
differed by gender; signi<U+FB01>cantly fewer girls than boys travelled alone to school in 1991, 1993,
2010, 2011 and 2012. Overall, these <U+FB01>ndings suggest that Australian children’s independent
mobility levels declined between 1991 and 2012.
