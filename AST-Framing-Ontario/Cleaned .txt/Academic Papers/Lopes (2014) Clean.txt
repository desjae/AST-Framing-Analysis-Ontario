Children’s independent mobility in Portugal: effects of urbanization
degree and motorized modes of travel

This study is aimed to evaluate the impact of urbanization in children’s independent mobility in Portugal.
Mobility licenses, actual mobility, fear of traf<U+FB01>c, stranger danger and sense of community were compared
in highly, moderately and non urbanized environments and according to gender. Results showed that
increase of urbanization leads to a decrease of children’s licenses to independently cross and cycle main
roads; go out after dark and go to places other than school. The rising of urbanization leads to an increase
of children’s mean age for independent active travel; and at the same time a decrease of independent
active school-home travel and leisure time activities. Parental fear regarding traf<U+FB01>c is the most frequent
cause for concern regarding children’s safety when they are outdoors. Stranger danger and low sense of
community are more prevalent in parents from the highly-urbanized environment. Overall, girls enjoy
less actual mobility than boys. The discussion shows that children’s freedom of movement in the
highly-urbanized setting is very restricted due to a pervasive automobile dependence, proposing a shift
from a motorized to a walkable city.

1. Introduction                                                                         
											
1.1. Children’s independent mobility                                                    
											
Children’s independent mobility (CIM) has been a crucial topic                      
of research and one of major importance in children’s lives                             
(Hillman et al., 1990; Johansson et al., 2010; Prezza, 2007). CIM                       
refers to the opportunities for children being able to move freely,                     
explore and play in their local physical surroundings at their own                      
pace and time, towards a progressively wider freedom of                                     
movement and acquisition of knowledge about the environment                             
(Björklid, 2004). According to Rudner (2011), CIM focuses on the                        
usage of public space by people under 18 years of age on their                          
own, that is without being accompanied by adults.                                       
Several studies acknowledge that children’s independent                             
mobility contributes to the overall health and well-being                               
(Fagerholm and Broberg, 2011; Mackett et al., 2005a; Mackett                            
and Paskins, 2008). On this topic, Brown et al. (2008) identi<U+FB01>ed                        
the bene<U+FB01>ts of children’s independent mobility summarized from                          
other European research, such as: development of motor skills;                          
increase in additional physical activity; in<U+FB02>uence on cognitive                         
											
development by helping children to increase their way-<U+FB01>nding
abilities, and also the development of emotional bonds between
children and the natural environment. A study conducted by
Rissotto and Tonucci (2002) in Italy concluded positively about
the role of freedom of movement in acquiring, processing and
structuring environmental knowledge. A systematic review of
studies done by Schoeppe et al. (2012) showed that children who
are autonomous playing outdoors and traveling actively undertake
more physical activity than those who are not.
Conversely, many studies refer to the negative effects of
constraining children’s autonomy and freedom of movement in
the context of children’s development and overall well-being such
as, hindering the acquisition of environmental knowledge
(Hillman, 1993); avoiding risk contact interactions in the physical
environment and jeopardizing the development of resilience (Gill,
2007). Also, restricting the development of social and motor skills
(Hüttenmoser, 1995) as well as spatial and analytical competence
(Rissotto et al., 2006) adds to the problem. Equally, reducing the
opportunities for outdoor and indoor independent play with peers
(Prezza et al., 2001); decreasing opportunities for physical activity
(Armstrong, 1993), accompanied with less spending of activity
calories (Mackett et al., 2005a, 2005b) and increasing of weight,
obesity and sedentary activities among children (Whitzman
et al., 2010) lead to further constraints of children’s autonomy.
Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Pacilli et al. (2013),											

using an integrative model, revealed that loneliness, as a result of
weak communities ties, low sense of security and less frequent
social activities with peers, is a consequence of children’s low independent 
mobility.
Nevertheless and despite its crucial importance on children’s
well-being and development, several studies indicate that children’s 
independent mobility has drastically reduced throughout
the last decades in many countries, such as Portugal (Arez and
Neto, 1999), England and Australia (Carver et al., 2013) and New
Zealand (Oliver et al., 2011).
The decrease of CIM seems to be related with a set of environmental 
and sociocultural transformations that have taken place in
industrialized countries over the past few decades. According to
Tranter and Sharpe (2012), these changes have a common denominator 
sustained on the availability of cheap oil, which enabled
modern urban societies to favor the widespread use of car on public 
space. This pedestrian unfriendly urban planning supports the
pervasiveness of a motorized car culture, increasing parental concern 
on children’s safety due to the risk of them being involved
in car caused accidents, as a consequence of fast and reckless driving 
and lack of walking facilities and crossings (Malone and
Rudner, 2011). Fyhri et al. (2011) carried out a study in Denmark,
Finland, Great Britain and Norway, and concluded that longer distances 
to school, traf<U+FB01>c, parents own convenience, children attending 
organized leisure time activities, more time pressure to
families, increased access to car and use of mobile phones for
transport arrangements have caused a decrease on children’s
active and independent mobility. Social fears reported by parents
as fear of crime, stranger danger, abduction and being bullied or
molested by older children are also documented as obstacles to
children’s freedom in public space (Alparone and Pacilli, 2012;
Gill, 2007; Zubrick et al., 2010).

1.2. Mobility licenses and modes of travel

CIM was <U+FB01>rst operationalized by the work of Hillman et al.
(1990), as a set of licenses granted by parents allowing children
to move around autonomously in the environment. This set of
licenses is de<U+FB01>ned as whether children are allowed without adult
supervision to: cross main roads, travel the home-school journey,
go to other places than school (walking distance scope), ride their
bicycle, use public transportation and go out after dark (Carver
et al., 2013; Hillman et al., 1990; Kyttä, 1997, 2004; O’Brien
et al., 2000). Likewise, children’s traveling to places without the
accompaniment of adults is associated with active transportation
such as walking, cycling and public transport use (Fyhri et al.,
2011; Hillman et al., 1990; Sharpe and Tranter, 2010). School and
leisure time activities are meaningful places for children (Broberg
et al., 2013; Kyttä et al., 2012) and therefore should be accessed
and traveled to autonomously and actively (Rissotto and Tonucci,
1999).

However, recent and past data has concluded that most children 
are being driven to school and to leisure time activities, preventing 
them of active travel forms (Mackett, 2002; Mammen
et al., 2012; Mclaren and Parusel, 2012). On this topic, Hjorthol
and Fyhri (2009) show in their study a decrease in children’s
autonomy when going to leisure activities, these generally being
organized and taking place outside the immediate neighborhood.
The authors also mention that a large proportion of Norwegian
children, between 6 and 12 years old, are driven to organized leisure 
activities. Simultaneously, they found out that increasing
parental anxiety about traf<U+FB01>c caused a decrease in children’s independence. 
According to Deka (2013) adults’ choice of driving to
work signi<U+FB01>cantly increases the probability of children being driven 
to school and decreases their likelihood of walking and cycling.

1.3. Degree of urbanization and children’s independent mobility

According to Johansson (2006) study about CIM to leisure
places adopting Küllers Human Environment Interaction (HEI)
model, parental decision to allow for child’s independent or driven
mobility is an emotional process in<U+FB02>uenced by the characteristics
of the leisure activity, physical and social environment, individual
parental factors and characteristics of the child. Also, in the study
conducted by Alparone and Pacilli (2012), the authors conclude
that CIM is in<U+FB02>uenced by the interplay of personal, environmental
and psychosocial variables hinged on the bioecological model of
human development proposed by Bronfenbrenner (1979). Based
on the previous theoretical models, physical environment characteristics 
either promote or hinder CIM. Hence, the degree of urbanization 
is a rather relevant environmental feature that in<U+FB02>uences
parents decision to enable or unable children’s independent travel,
as well as it may potentiate or hinder children’s possibilities to
actualize their interactions with the environment. On this subject,
Kyttä (2004) notes that characteristics of the environment, as well
as the degree of freedom children have to explore it have great
impact on how they perceive, act and move in their surroundings.
If in the past it was clearer that rural environments afforded better
possibilities for children’s freedom of movement than more urbanized 
environments, nowadays, consistent results in many studies
confront those earlier <U+FB01>ndings (Broberg et al., 2013; Carver et al.,
2012; Kyttä et al., 2012).

1.4. Aim of study

A considerable amount of research has been produced internationally 
about CIM and its variation in terms of the urban/rural
environment dichotomy. In Portugal, so far, most available data
on CIM is of descriptive nature. Preliminary results of an international 
research show that CIM of Portuguese children occupies
the 10th place among a total of 16 countries, led by Finland and followed 
by Japan and reared by Italy and Sri Lanka, respectively
(Bicket, 2013). However, less attention has been paid to the in<U+FB02>uence 
of urbanization in children’s freedom of movement. Moreover, 
national research has been scarce in studying how prone
the city environment is for children’s autonomy and independent
active travel. Therefore, the current research closes this gap by
addressing children’s mobility in the above terms in order to gain
a more wholesome perspective of this phenomenon. The purpose
of this paper is <U+FB01>rstly to characterize psychosocial factors that
affect CIM, namely, parental fears regarding children’s safety; and
perception on sense of community, in the highly, moderately and
non-urbanized environments. Secondly, is to assess how children’s
mobility licenses and actual mobility vary in a highly, moderately
and non urbanized types of environment. Lastly, is to draw attention 
to the speci<U+FB01>c case of CIM in the highly-urbanized setting (city
environment) proposing a shift in the city from a motorized and
dependent children’s mobility to an active and autonomous one.

2. Methodology

2.1. Participants

Participants were selected from the Portuguese sample
(n = 1099, 16 schools involved) which was part of an international
comparison research on CIM, led by researchers at Policy Studies
Institute (PSI), London. According the international CIM research
guided by PSI, <U+FB01>ve types of settlements were indicated, ‘‘Inner
City’’, ‘‘Urban’’, ‘‘Suburban, ‘‘Small Town’’ and ‘‘Rural’’.
To study effect of urbanization degree in CIM, three types of
environments were extracted from the original sample, namely,

‘‘Inner City’’ (n1 = 223; 54% boys, 46% girls) as ‘‘highly-urbanized’’;
‘‘Small town’’ (n2 = 192, 44% boys, 56% girls) as ‘‘moderately-urbanized’’;
and ‘‘Rural’’ (n3 = 137, 48% boys, 52% girls) as ‘‘non-urbanized’’. 
The urbanizing categories of our sample were devised
upon population density and other relevant territorial information
available in the of<U+FB01>cial web sites of the local councils, and in the
Statistics Portugal web site (INE). The ‘‘highly urbanized’’ setting
is constituted by the areas that correspond to the center of Lisbon
(parish of São João de Brito). This is considered a typical consolidated 
inner urban area with moderate dense housing, easy access
to public transport, different services and cultural areas, and with a
population density of 5143.4 people/km2. The ‘‘moderately-urbanized’’ 
setting corresponds to the small town of Silves in the south of
the country. Silves has a population density of 54.6 people/km2;
limited use of public transportation (due to lack of connections);
moderate dense housing, different services and cultural areas;
characterized by a loss of active population in the last 30 years
due to migratory <U+FB02>uxes. The ‘‘non-urbanized’’ setting corresponds
to Redondo in the southeast-central of the country. Redondo is a
typical rural area characterized by a concentrated settlement of
houses and population and by the deserti<U+FB01>cation tendency of rural
spaces. It has a population density of 19.02 people/km2, restricted
access          to        public        transportation               (almost
nonexistent), few services and lack of cultural areas. For some analysis 
children were grouped in primary (3rd to 6th grade;
Mage = 9.81 yrs; SD = 1.45) and secondary (7th to 10th grade; M
age = 13.89 yrs; SD = 0.99) school types. In order to conduct this
study, Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee
of Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, Universidade de Lisboa, as
well as authorization from the General Department of Education
from the Portuguese Education and Science Ministry.

2.2. Methods and data collection

The international child independent mobility questionnaires for
parents and children used by PSI researchers were translated to
Portuguese. Following initial contact and agreement with each
school, parental consent for each child and parent participation
in the study was requested. Parents were sent a package with a
consent form and a parental questionnaire to be completed at
home. Children that were allowed to participate have also
completed a questionnaire in school. In order to link the correct
questionnaires between parents and children, each dyad was
linked by a unique and shared code on both questionnaires. Data
collection occurred during 2011 (Spring-time) in the moderately
and non-urban settlements and in 2012 (Spring-time) in the
highly-urbanized one.

2.3. Measures and data analysis

The in<U+FB02>uence of gender was analyzed in this present study, in
the overall sample and in some cases within the different territorial 
typologies. In order to characterize psychosocial factors that
affect CIM, parental perception regarding children’s safety was
measured as ‘‘reasons to collect children at school’’, ‘‘concern about
the risk of the child being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident when
crossing a road’’; ‘‘sense of neighborhood safety’’ and ‘‘sense of
community’’. In order to study CIM according to the degree of
urbanization, children’s age for independent active travel, mobility
licenses, actual mobility in the home-school trajectory and in
weekend leisure time activities were also measured. These
variables and questions that were used to compose them and
parents’/children’s possible answers are depicted in Table 1.
Frequency analysis and Chi Square tests were performed to
analyze differences in reasons to collect children at school,
mobility licenses and actual mobility on the home-school trajectory 

among the three research environments and by gender. Univariate 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Scheffe tests
were conducted to compare levels of concern about the risk of
the child being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident when crossing a road,
sense of neighborhood safety, perception on sense of community,
children’s age for independent active travel and actual mobility
during weekend leisure time activities. Independent sample t tests
were conducted to investigate gender differences in these
variables. Also, descriptive statistics were used to calculate the
frequency of each independent and non-independent activity and
reasons to collect children at school.

2.4. Results

2.4.1. Psychosocial factors that affect CIM

2.4.1.1. Parental fears regarding children’s safety: traf<U+FB01>c and social

danger. In Table 2, <U+FB01>ndings about main reasons for parents to collect 
children at school are summarized. According to our results,
traf<U+FB01>c danger is the most representative concern in all three environments 
(51.6% in the highly-urbanized, 62.2% in the moderately-urbanized 
and 66.4% in the non-urbanized). These values
are consistent with other <U+FB01>ndings, in the present study, showing
a signi<U+FB01>cant effect of the risk of a child being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident 
when crossing a road on the parental level of concern according 
to the urbanization condition [F(2, 523) = 4.876, p = .008]. Post
hoc tests indicated that parents from the highly-urbanized environment 
are less concerned about traf<U+FB01>c than parents from the moderately-urbanized 
one. The second most cited cause of concern by
parents in the highly and moderately settings is danger from adults,
with values of 49.3% and 46.8%, accordingly, whereas only 34.3% of
parents in non-urban area refer to it. Concerning parental level of
agreement about the presence of some young people and adults
in the neighbourhood that make them afraid to let their children
play outdoors, signi<U+FB01>cant differences were found according to the
type of environment [F(2, 505) = 6.012, p = .003]. Post hoc tests
indicated that parents in the three environments do not perceive
young people and adults in their neighborhood as a threat for their
children’s safety while they are playing outdoors. Speci<U+FB01>cally, parents 
from the non-urbanized environment are more con<U+FB01>dent that
young people and adults in their neighborhood do not pose a threat
to their children’s outdoor safety than parents from the highly-urbanized 
setting. The in<U+FB02>uences of gender in parental fears regarding 
traf<U+FB01>c and social danger were only relevant in the highly
urbanized environment, where danger from adults was the most
representative reason for parents to pick their daughters up from
school. In all other cases, traf<U+FB01>c was always the main parental concern. 
Danger from adults was pointed out as relevant by more parents 
of girls (56.7%) than of boys (42.1%) (v2(1) = 4.468, p = .035) in
the highly urbanized setting.

2.4.1.2. Perception on sense of community. A signi<U+FB01>cant effect

regarding parental level of agreement about most adults in the
neighborhood looking out for other people’s children was found
for the three conditions [F(2, 518) = 5.346, p = .005]. Post hoc tests
indicated that parents from the highly and moderately urbanized
environments tend not to trust that other adults in the neighborhood 
supervise other people’s children, when compared to parents
from the non-urbanized environment that are more convinced
about other adults capabilities to supervise their children. No
gender differences were found for this variable.

2.4.2. CIM and degree of urbanization

2.4.2.1. Children’s age for independent active travel. There was a signi<U+FB01>cant 
effect of the age for children to travel on their own according 
to the type of environment [F(2, 527) = 5.56, p = .004]. Post hoc
tests indicated that the mean ages were signi<U+FB01>cantly different for

the three groups of participants. Children from the non-urbanized                              
environment are allowed to travel on their own from the mean age                               
of 11 (M = 11.05; SD = 1.86), whereas children from the ‘‘moderately-urbanized’’ 
and ‘‘highly-urbanized’’ environments are only                               
allowed active travel at the mean age of 12 (M = 11.65; SD = 1.58)                             
and 13 (M = 12.56; SD = 1.43) years old. Overall, gender does not                              
in<U+FB02>uence the mean age for children’s independent active travel                                 
[t(520) = .642, p = .521].                                                                     
												
2.4.2.2. Mobility licenses. Gender did not in<U+FB02>uence the parental                               
granting of mobility licenses, since there were no signi<U+FB01>cant differences 
between the frequency of boys and girls granted any of the                               
licenses for the whole sample, between primary and secondary                                   
groups, and within the 3 territorial typologies (all ps>.05). The                              
results on CIM licenses and degree of urbanization for primary                                 
and secondary school children are shown in Fig. 1. In both cases,                             
the percentage of children corresponds to those children who were                              
granted each license by their parents among the total number of                                
children in each of the research groups.                                                       
In terms of primary school category (nhighly-urbanized = 115;                            
nmoderatley-urbanized = 124; nnon-urbanized = 82), we found signi<U+FB01>cant                         
results in all independent mobility licenses, except on going out                              
after dark and traveling on local buses. More children from the                                
moderately urbanized setting were allowed to independently                                     
travel home from school (30.6%), followed by 23.8% of children                                 
from the non-urban and 14.8% of children from the highly-urbanized 
settings (v2(2) = 8.445, p = .015). Regarding being allowed to
independently cross main roads (v2(2) = 6.633, p = .036), our <U+FB01>ndings 
show that in the non-urbanized and moderately-urbanized
groups, a signi<U+FB01>cant percentage of children, 50% and 47.5%, respectively, 
enjoyed this license, whereas only 33.6% of children from
the highly-urbanized environment are allowed to do this. With
regard to cycling independently on main roads, the trend is similar
to the former license, showing higher percentage of allowed children 
in the non and moderately urbanized groups (28.4% and
19%) and 11.4% of children in the highly-urbanized setting
(v2(2) = 7.531, p = .023). Concerning going independently to places
other than school (v2(2) = 11.176, p = .004), the highest value of
children that are allowed this license is registered on the moderately-urbanized 
environment (33.9%), followed by the non and
highly urbanized areas, with 28% and 14.8%, respectively. With
regard to the secondary school children (nhighly-urbanized = 108;
nmoderatley-urbanized = 68; nnon-urbanized = 55), we found differences,
between the three environments on the licenses to independently
go out after dark (52.7% in the non-urban, 30.9% in the moderatelyurban, 
19.6% in the highly-urban); cycle on main roads (86.4% in
the non-urban, 73.1% in the moderately-urban, 42% in the highlyurban) 
and go to places other than school (92.7% in the non-urban,
83.8% in the moderately-urban, 74.8% in the highly-urban). These
results are all statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (v2(2) = 18.652, p < .001;
v2(2) = 25.746, p < .001 and v2(2) = 11.176, p = .004, respectively,
for each of the former licenses). Regarding traveling independently

on local buses, our results are signi<U+FB01>cant (v2(2) = 28.580, p < .001)
among the three settings but with a different trend than the other
licenses, since this one is more prevalent in the highly-urban setting 
(88.2% in the highly-urban, 62.1% in the moderately urban
and 50% in the non-urban).

2.4.2.3. Actual mobility in the home-school trajectory. As regards to
children’s actual mobility when going to school and coming back
home, see Fig. 2. We found signi<U+FB01>cant differences in children’s
independent and active travel from home to school between the
three environments, both in primary (v2(2) = 18.703, p < .001)
and in secondary (v2(2) = 6.551, p = .038) school children. Concerning 
the primary children, the highest percentage of independent
and active travelers occurs in the moderately-urbanized setting
(22.6%). In the secondary children, the non-urban typology counts
with the greatest percentage of independent and active mode of
travel (43.6%). In terms of gender, and only for secondary school
children in the highly urbanized area, signi<U+FB01>cant differences were
found between the percentage of boys (41.5%) and girls (22.2%)
that go to school independently and actively (v2(1) = 4.590,
p = .032). Signi<U+FB01>cant differences were also revealed in the analysis
of the school-home trajectory in terms of independent active travel. 
For the primary group (v2(2) = 17.031, p < .001), more children
from the moderately-urban environment were independent and
active on their way back home (27.4%). In terms of gender, and
only for primary school children in the moderately urbanized area,
signi<U+FB01>cant differences were found between the percentage of boys
(38.9%) and girls (19.4%) that go to school independently and
actively (v2(1) = 5.619, p = .018). As regards to the secondary
group, more children from the non-urban environment travel

home from school independently and actively (60%), followed by
those from the moderately and non urbanized environments,
38.2% and 34.3%, respectively. These differences were signi<U+FB01>cant
(v2(2) = 10.380, p = .006).

2.4.2.4. Actual mobility in weekend leisure time activities. Considering 
the mean number of independent activities, children from
the highly-urbanized environment were involved in 2 independent
activities (M = 1.83, SD = 2.13, Median = 1, range 0–12), whereas
children from the moderately and non-urban environments took
part in 3 independent activities (M = 2.57, SD = 2.37, Median = 2,
range 0–12 and M = 2.63, SD = 2.71, Median = 2, range 0–12,
respectively). The differences between settings were signi<U+FB01>cant
[F(2, 549) = 7.579, p = .001]. Differences between gender were
observed in the number of independent activities done by girls
and boys of the moderately urbanized environment (t(160) =
3.385, p = .001) and of the non-urbanized environment
(t(120) = 2.314, p = .022). In both environments, girls participated
in about 2 non-accompanied activities during the weekend (moderately 
urbanized: M = 2.02, SD = 2.09; non-urbanized: M = 2.13,
SD = 2.32), whereas boys participate in about 3 (moderately urbanized: 
M = 3.18, SD = 2.52; non-urbanized: M = 3.20, SD = 3.01).
With regards to mean number of non-independent activities,
thus, accompanied journeys (with a parent or another adult) to leisure 
activities, our results are also signi<U+FB01>cant [F(2, 549) = 11.823,
p < .001]. The highest number of non-independent activities is 4
and belongs to children from the moderately-urban setting
(M = 4.10, SD = 3.41, Median = 3, range 0–12), followed by 3
non-independent activities for children from the highly-urban
group (M = 3.09, SD = 2.98, Median = 2, range 0–12) and from the

non-urban environment (M = 2.73, SD = 2.48, Median = 2, range
0–12). Non-urbanized area congregates the least number of non-independent
activities. This result is not surprising if we consider
previous <U+FB01>ndings on mean number of independent activities. No
gender differences were found in the number of non-independent
activities for any of the settings. The percentages of independent
and non-independent activities done by children in each environment 
are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Each value corresponds 
to the percentage of children that took part in a certain
activity, within each study group. Children were free to choose
more than one option and could report to have done the same
activity both independently or accompanied by adults.

2.5. Discussion

2.5.1. Environmental and psychosocial factors that affect CIM
In terms of parental concerns regarding children’s safety, our
results show that fear of traf<U+FB01>c is the most prominent one in all
three environments. In the non-urbanized setting more parents
are concerned about this than in the other two settings. One possible 
reason to explain this is that children in the non-urbanized
areas may be less exposed to traf<U+FB01>c circulation than the other children. 
Consequently, their parents may look at them as less competent 
to deal with traf<U+FB01>c issues, what might increase the percentage
of parents of this group who feel this type of concern. In relation to
the risk of children being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident when crossing
the road, our <U+FB01>ndings reinforce the former, showing that parents
are strongly concerned about it. In terms of traf<U+FB01>c concern and
degree of urbanization, our <U+FB01>ndings show that this type of parental
concern becomes more frequent as the urbanization degree of the
environment decreases. This is consistent with Tillberg Mattsson
(2002), who found that Swedish parents in the countryside environment 
are more worried about traf<U+FB01>c as a threat for children’s
safety when they are outdoors than parents from the town environment. 
Conversely, Shaw et al. (2012), using the same methodology 
adopted in the present study, found that parents from a rural
village in England are less concerned about children being at risk
due to traf<U+FB01>c danger than parents from the inner-city area. More-over, 
Johansson (2006), based on a model of Human–Environment
Interaction, concluded that attitudes towards driving children to
places are based on parents’ perceptions of environmental factors,
namely, traf<U+FB01>c danger. Stranger danger was found to be a signi<U+FB01>cant 
cause of concern amongst the three types of environment.
Our results show that frequency of perception of danger from

adults accompanies the decrease of urbanization degree. As to
the gender differences related with danger from adults, our most
interesting result is found in the highly urbanized environment.
In this setting, stranger danger is more referred by girls’ parents
than by boys’ as cause of concern when children are out by themselves. 
However, overall we found that parents are not afraid to let
their children play outdoors because of the presence of other people 
in their neighborhood; and, speci<U+FB01>cally, parents from the non-urbanized 
environment are more at ease with the presence of
other people in their neighborhood than parents from the highly-urbanized 
setting. These results about parental perception of social
danger are consistent with those found by Prezza et al. (2005) in
Italy revealing that perception of social danger was higher in mothers 
who live in larger urban contexts and who have more personal
fear of crime and a lower sense of community. Also, our <U+FB01>ndings
concur to those of many other studies referring that perception
of stranger danger and traf<U+FB01>c related concerns are alleged by parents 
as inhibitors for children’s independent and/or active commuting 
to school (Björklid, 2004; Davison et al., 2008; Lam and
Loo, 2013). With regard to parental perception on sense of community, 
Prezza et al. (2001) argue that stronger neighborhood relations, 
together with sense of belonging and of community enable
more shared control and surveillance for children and help parents
to perceive neighborhood as a safe place for their children to move
about freely.
Our most relevant <U+FB01>nding is that parents from more urban environments 
do not perceive a mutual surveillance network that gives
security to children when they are out by themselves in their
neighborhood. Furthermore, this may suggest that sense of community 
decreases with increase of urbanization degree. This concurs 
with other studies that have reported stronger sense of
community in rural and small town areas than in typologies with
a greater degree of urbanization (Obst et al., 2002; Roussi et al.,
2006). However, other studies have shown the opposite, revealing
that in places with a high degree of urbanization, the sense of community 
is greater that in less urbanized contexts (Prezza et al.,
2009).

2.5.2. CIM and degree of urbanization
Children’s mean age for independent active travel was found to
diminish with the decrease of urbanization (13, 12 and 11 in the
highly, moderately and non urbanized environments, respectively).
The highly and moderately urbanized results are consistent with
some <U+FB01>ndings of a recent research conducted in the state of

Victoria (Australia) where parents (with children aged under 18                                  
living at home) said that, on average, children should be over                                   
12 years old to walk or cycle alone and nearly 14 years old (13.8)                               
to go independently on public transport; and parents of primary                                  
school children reported 11.6 years old for traveling to school independently 
(VicHealth, 2011). It is important to outline that in the                              
former research variables no difference was found between the                                    
rural and urban areas of Victoria. Regarding the effect of urbanization 
on children’s mean age for independent active travel, our                                   
results are similar to Kyttä’s (1997) results in a study comparing                               
CIM in the urban, small town and rural Finnish environments.                                     
The researcher found that mean age for parents to allow their children 
to go out alone was 5.6 in the city, 4.5 in the small town and                              
4.3 in the rural village. Nevertheless, the mean age for Portuguese                              
children to move independently nearly trebles in two of the settings 
and is over the double in the other one. With reference to primary 
school children’s mobility licenses, we found that an increase                              
of urban degree corresponds to a decrease in the percentage of                                   
children that are allowed to independently cross main roads and                                  
cycle on them. Moreover, the non-urbanized environment is the                                    
most capable for allowing children the former two licenses. The                                  
same result was found in Shaw et al. (2012), where primary school                                
children from the rural setting had the highest levels of independence 
for these two licenses, as well as for going to places other                               
than school. Conversely, our results show that a highly-urbanized                                
area is the least friendly for young children to be allowed the independent 
mobility licenses, except for the case of traveling alone on                             
local buses, probably due to the fact that the city environment has                              
better link of public transport than the other surveyed settings.                                
These <U+FB01>ndings are similar to those found in an urban core area of                                
Hong Kong, where children aged 6–12 years old showed the lowest                                  
levels of independent mobility when compared to rural and government-planned 
new town environments (Lam and Loo, 2013).    

Concerning gender differences in the age for independent active
travel, we found no difference between boys and girls. This result
contrasts with those from previous studies (e.g., Brown et al.,
2008; Mackett et al., 2005b), which mention that boys became
independent at an earlier age than girls. As regards to mobility
licenses for the secondary school children, our <U+FB01>ndings show that
a great majority of young people are granted all six independent
mobility licenses, except going out after dark for the highly and
moderately urbanized environments and cycling on main roads
for the highly-urbanized group. Previous research carried out by
O’Brien et al. (2000) in different urban settings also concluded that
a great majority of secondary school children are allowed to freely
navigate their environment. Speci<U+FB01>cally, we found that lower
degree of urbanization allows more children to independently go
out after dark, cycle on main roads and go to places other than
school. The previous author also found that children who live in
non-urbanized or low-density environments enjoy greater freedom 
to move around than children from highly-urbanized or
high-density areas. On the contrary, as for traveling independently
on local buses, our <U+FB01>ndings show that more children are allowed
this license as urbanization degree increases. A possible reason
for this <U+FB01>nding is having higher availability of public transport in
the city area. Overall, with regards to actual mobility in the
home-school journey, percentages of primary school children that
travel autonomously and independently to and from school are
low. These results are consistent with parental <U+FB01>ndings on the
license for children to go home from school independently (just
over 30%), mentioned in Section 2.4.2. of the current paper. As to
mobility licenses according the sex of the child, gender was not
found to be an in<U+FB02>uential variable for the whole sample, between
primary and secondary groups or within the three types of environment. 
Likewise, Kyttä’s (2004) research on children’s independent 
mobility and affordances did not show gender differences in                                   

mobility licenses. Also, a more recent study conducted by Carver
and colleagues did not reveal any gender differences in the mobility 
licenses of primary school children in England and Australia
(Carver et al., 2013).
Moreover, present scores of children’s mobility licenses corroborate
<U+FB01>ndings from a study conducted in Portugal, where areal characteristics 
were found to signi<U+FB01>cantly in<U+FB02>uence parental granting of
these licenses (Cordovil et al., in press). Not surprisingly, independent 
active travel was found to increase with age. Such <U+FB01>nding reinforces 
Carver et al. (2013) results in urban and rural areas of England,
and is consistent with evidence shown in the program ‘‘We go to
school alone’’ (Prezza et al., 2010). However, Carver et al. (2012)
found that older boys from rural environment show signi<U+FB01>cantly
lower levels of independent and active commuting to and from
school than younger ones. In both primary and secondary children
in all three environments, coming home from school is when children 
are more active and independent. A possible reason for this
might be due to parents’ lack of time to pick children up at the end
of the school day as a result of work commitments. In one hand, such
<U+FB01>nding concurs with Shaw et al. (2012) regarding English secondary
school children’s mode of travel from school to home; in the other
hand, Björklid and Gummesson (2013) did not <U+FB01>nd any signi<U+FB01>cant
differences in children’s answers regarding accompaniment to and
from school. For the secondary school children, independent and
active travel from school to home drops as the degree of urbanization 
increases. This is different from the results of a review on children’s 
active commuting to school stating that children from the
urban milieu are more likely to walk or cycle to school than children
from rural environments (Davison et al., 2008). Concerning actual
mobility during weekend leisure activities, our <U+FB01>ndings show that
the mean number of non-independent activities is higher than the
mean number of independent activities in the three environments.
Mean number of independent activities was quite low (between 2
and 3). Moreover, a decrease of urbanization degree corresponds
to an increase in the mean number of this type of activities. This
result contrasts with Tillberg Mattsson (2002), who found children’s
independent travel to leisure activities to be higher in more urbanized 
type of milieu. Also, Kyttä (1997) did not <U+FB01>nd any signi<U+FB01>cant differences 
among rural, small town and city environments, in the
proportions of children’s independent journeys to outdoor activities.
In the present study, moderately-urbanized environment afforded
highest participation of children in independent leisure time activities. 
This <U+FB01>nding is coherent with Kyttä et al. (2012), who concluded
that moderate urban density offers very high possibilities for children’s 
independent use of it, promoting active behavioral patterns
and access to meaningful places. According to our results, the most
common independent activities accessed by children were going
to a friend’s house; going for a walk or cycling around; and playing
sports or swimming. All of these values were registered in the moderately 
urbanized setting. These activities are somewhat consistent
with those found by Björklid and Gummesson (2013), namely ‘‘going
to a friend’s home’’ which was, in both cases, the most common
activity. As to non-independent activities, the majority of the maximum 
values were also concentrated in the moderately-urbanized
setting, namely, going to shops; visiting relatives or grown-ups
and going to the cinema. Based on our <U+FB01>ndings, when on their own
or with the company of peers, children report accessing leisure
activities where they can be more physically active (i.e., sports,
walking, cycling), whereas in the company of adults they engage
in more sedentary activities (like shopping), probably dictated by
the adults’ own convenience and needs. Regarding the effect of gender 
on the actual mobility in the home-school trajectory, in the
highly and moderately urbanized settings more boys than girls travel 
to school independently and actively. However, these differences
are only found in the secondary group of children for the highly
urbanized setting and in the primary group for the moderately

urbanized setting. During weekend leisure time activities, boys from
the moderately and non urbanized environments, engage in a higher
number of independent activities than girls. Overall, these gender
differences in terms of actual mobility are similar to the <U+FB01>ndings
of Fyhri and Hjorthol (2009) who showed that boys have a higher
mobility index than girls when going to school and to leisure
activities.
Although this study is noteworthy of the impact of urbanization
in children’s independent mobility, it also has some limitations.
The type of questions of the survey, which focused speci<U+FB01>cally on
actual mobility in the home-school journey and during weekend
leisure time activities, are speci<U+FB01>c to the day the questionnaire
was <U+FB01>lled and to the previous weekend, respectively. This fact
could present some bias in terms of the representativeness of the
usual daily and weekend mobility. Moreover, complementary
qualitative research should be conducted, in order to gain a more
in-depth grasp about the links between children’s independent
mobility and degree of urbanization.


2.5.3. A need for a change of CIM in the highly urbanized environment:

from a motorized city to a walkable one
In the highly-urbanized environment, our <U+FB01>ndings show that
children’s mean age for independent active travel is 13 years old,
the highest from the three settings. Regarding mobility licenses,
we found that the lowest percentage of secondary school children
allowed to independently go out after dark, cycle on main roads
and go to places other than school occurs in the city setting; as to
primary school children, the minimum percentage allowed to independently 
cross main roads and cycle on them, and to go to places
other than school takes place in the former setting. In terms of
actual mobility, the smallest value of secondary school children that
return home from school actively and independently occurs in the
highly-urbanized group, as well as the least mean number of independent 
leisure time activities. Moreover, the city environment registered 
highest level of parental concern regarding strange danger;
strong concern regarding traf<U+FB01>c; and lowest parental sense of community. 
These results show that CIM in the city of Lisbon is quite
restricted, meaning that this conspicuous highly-urbanized environment 
does not seem to gather enough requirements and opportunities 
for children’s and young people’s independent movement
and autonomous environmental experiences. Simultaneously, it is
very relevant the fact that in the Great Lisbon, 20.5% of its population 
is composed of children and young people, aged between 0
and 14 years old (Pordata and Statistics Portugal, 2011). Therefore,
such city’s unfriendliness towards children’s independent and
active movement should be a topic of major concern. Churchman
(2003) recommends that cities and neighborhoods should physically 
and socially provide opportunities for children’s independent
travel, play and use of public space. Additionally, Burdette and
Whitaker (2005) and Mainella et al. (2011) call the attention for
the need to reinstall free outdoor play back into children’s lives
due to its therapeutic value in terms of child development, wellbeing 
and happiness. Moreover, Weston (2010) claims that the primary 
reason cities should designed for young people (11–15 years
old) to independently travel within them is because the area of
the brain related to spatial perception and analysis is developing
in this period of time and freedom of movement is determinant
for such development to occur. Therefore, it is our opinion that
changing the city’s paradigm of child mobility from driving to walking 
should become a public health goal.

3. Concluding remarks

In this study we have shown that an increase of urbanization 
degree leads to a general decrease of children’s independent
mobility. Gender did not in<U+FB02>uence the independent mobility
licenses. Nevertheless, boys have higher levels of actual mobility
than girls. Parental perception of stranger danger is more frequent
in parents from the city environment as well as a lower sense of
community. We have also shown that parental fears regarding traf<U+FB01>c
and stranger danger are the most frequent among the three
environments with different degree of urbanization. According to
our results, children from the city environment are those whose
quest for independence and autonomy is more at risk. We believe
that children’s daily chauffeuring and escorting in public space, as
a result of a pervasive motorized culture and of cultural speci<U+FB01>c
factors, strongly contribute for this decrease of CIM. In this way,
instead of exploring the city environment at their own pace and
freedom, actively moving from place to place, children are sight-seeing 
the territory in the back seat of automobiles. Their vision
of the environment is a motorized one where meaningful places
are isolated islands, excluded from each other. Furthermore, children’s 
bodies are being excluded from freedom of movement and
their interactions with the physical environment are severely
restricted. Consequently, children’s autonomy, health and development 
are at risk. Hence, in order to reverse this body-space alienation 
and concomitantly rescue both children’s and the city’s wellbeing, 
a shift from a motorized city to a walkable one is not only
advisable, as it is desperately needed.
