E<U+FB00>ect of distance from home to school and spatial dependence between                                                                                                    T
homes on mode of commuting to school

Active commuting to school (i.e., walking and cycling) has health implications for young people. Therefore, it of
 interest to determine how the distance students walk to school varies depending on where they live and how
their decision to walk is a<U+FB00>ected by contextual/environmental variables. This study aimed to examine which of
the distances (Euclidean, Manhattan, walking-network and driving-network) is the best predictor of the decision
to walk to school and determine the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of active commuting to school for four high schools in
Granada, Spain. To achieve these aims, the regression-kriging method was used. The results indicated that the
Euclidean and the walking distances were the best predictors of the decision to walk to school. Spatial dependence 
produced by some locational variables and spatial contagion among students was found to be moderate to
strong. In addition, the spatial range of this spatial dependence is approximately 1000 m to 1600 m. Regression-
kriging could be implemented in a geographic information system to determine the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of schools
and aid urban designers and planners in developing neighborhoods that support active modes of commuting.
Identifying the areas of in<U+FB02>uence is important for promoting active modes of transport by local governments.

1. Introduction                                                                                  
												
Most urban models, such as “new urbanism”, aim to minimize car                               
use and its negative impact on the environment while promoting more                              
pedestrian-friendly features (Crane and Crepeau, 1998). These models                             
focus on reducing the distance between locations and increasing the                              
feasibility of alternative modes of transport, such as walking, cycling or                       
public transportation. To this end, policies have been designed to reduce 
road congestion, as well as urban pollution and dispersion. These                           
factors are also associated with the location of schools in urban areas.                         
Studies that have investigated the e<U+FB00>ects of school location have been                           
based on aggregated (zonal) or detailed (household) data. The latter                             
type are more appropriate when studying the e<U+FB00>ects of distance and                               
accessibility on the choice of commuting mode (Handy, 1996).                                     
The commuting mode children use to go to school has been widely                              
discussed in recent years and has economic, social, health and environmental 
e<U+FB00>ects (Faulkner et al., 2013; Li and Zhao, 2015; Mandic                             
et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 2010). The e<U+FB00>ect of the distance from                               
household to school on transport mode choice is well known. Several                              
studies have shown that the distance from home to school is a stronger                           

predictor of active commuting to school (ACS) in school-age students
(Chillón et al., 2015; Davison et al., 2008; McDonald, 2008) and that
shorter distances are associated with higher rates of active travel
(Mandic et al., 2015; Pont et al., 2009; Rodríguez-López et al., 2017).
Previous evidence is available on the current distance that young
people are willing to walk to school. In the United States, 31% of trips
from home to school made by walking are under one mile (1.6 km) (US
Department of Health Human Services, 2008). The criterion distance
for walking to school has been reported to be 1.2 miles (2.0 km) among
Belgian adolescents (Van Dyck et al., 2010) and 1.5 miles (2.4 km)
among Irish adolescents (Nelson et al., 2008). In the UK, the statutory
walking distance for English children has been set at 3 miles (4.8 km)
(Government/DfES, 2005), while for Japanese students it is approximately 
2.5–3.7 miles (4.0–6.0 km), although the actual distance depends 
on the children's age (Mori et al., 2012). Although there is no
universal criteria, some studies have shown that a distance of about
2.5 miles (4.0 km) is considered reasonable for adolescent walkers
(Nelson et al., 2008). Therefore, one question of interest is to determine
the distance that children and adolescents are expected to walk from
home to school. In this study, walking distance is de<U+FB01>ned as the radius

of in<U+FB02>uence around the school, which may vary depending on the
particular locational factors of each area of the city, such as crime,
tra<U+FB03>c, the environment, urban design, socioeconomic characteristics,
and others.
As a result of these factors, the area of in<U+FB02>uence of schools need not
be necessarily circular but may form irregular polygons within which
the school is located. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have
investigated the e<U+FB00>ects of spatial dependence and distance between
households on travel mode choice and the presence of spatial distribution 
patterns (Mitra et al., 2010). In our study it has been assumed
that households located close to each other in a given geographic area
are a<U+FB00>ected by similar locational factors. These locational factors may
cause young people living in the same area to encourage others located
nearby to make similar transport mode choices, thus leading to the
presence of spatial autocorrelation. In addition, these variables are not
always easy to observe, measure or specify in a speci<U+FB01>c model. Moreover, 
since the decision to walk to school may depend on locational
factors, it could cause a contagion e<U+FB00>ect, which can have a major impact 
on urban tra<U+FB03>c, environmental pollution and climate change, but
also provide substantial health bene<U+FB01>ts (de Hartog et al., 2010).
ACS provides an opportunity for increasing daily physical activity
level (Chillon et al., 2011; Panter et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2015; van Loon
and Frank, 2011). Indeed, it has been shown that youth who walk to                      
school are more physically active than those who are driven (Faulkner
et al., 2009). Because ACS is a complex behavior in<U+FB02>uenced by multiple 
factors at di<U+FB00>erent levels of the person-environment system and has      
several public health bene<U+FB01>ts, it is of interest to conduct research that  
can aid policymakers in implementing e<U+FB00>ective strategies targeted at    
promoting ACS.     
Several methods have been used in the literature to measure distance, 
among them self-reported questionnaires to determine the distance 
of the route from home to school (Burke and Brown, 2007; Panter 
et al., 2010), geographic information systems (GIS) (Panter et al., 2010; 
Timperio et al., 2006), sketch maps of the route (Schantz and Stigell, 
2009), Google Maps™ (Mendoza et al., 2011; Voss and Sandercock, 
2010) or global positioning systems (GPS) (Duncan and Mummery, 
2007; Duncan et al., 2007). Discrete choice models, such as the classic 
logistic regression model or logit model which are equivalent to log-linear 
models (Wasserman and Pattison, 1996), have been used to determine 
the probability that an individual will choose a particular  
means of transport based on a set of explanatory variables. The classic  
logistic regression model has been widely used in the literature on the 
mobility of children to schools (Pont et al., 2009). Di<U+FB00>erent types of 
geometric distances can be measured in di<U+FB00>erent ways. Although the 
most commonly used measure of distance in the literature on child  
mobility is the Euclidean distance (McDonald, 2007a), other measures 
of distance, such as the Manhattan distance, the walking distance and
the driving distance, are also used in this study (a graphical description
of each is shown in Fig. 1). In addition, the classic logistic regression
model is based on the assumption of independence of perturbations,
which are considered unobserved random variables. This hypothesis is  
not satis<U+FB01>ed when the presence of spatial autocorrelation between  
perturbations is suspected due to the presence of locational factors and  
contagion e<U+FB00>ects. If spatial autocorrelation is present in the model 
perturbations, a spatial regression model is more suitable (Overmars 
et al., 2003). Therefore, to account for the presence of spatial auto-correlation 
in perturbations, the regression-kriging method is used  
(Cressie, 1991). In addition to spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity
is another aspect to be considered in the regression model (Anselin, 
1988). Geographically weighted regression is a method that has been 
shown to be suitable for modeling spatial heterogeneity in the <U+FB01>eld of 
transportation (Feuillet et al., 2018). 
Although the Euclidean distance is the most commonly used metric 
in research on child mobility, other types of geographical distances 
have also been analyzed, such as the network and Manhattan distances
(Arafat and Abed Al Musa, 2017). These authors examined the network            

and Manhattan distances and the presence of spatial autocorrelation in
the model perturbations. Model perturbations are due to the contagion
e<U+FB00>ect of household, family and unobserved locational factors (crime,
tra<U+FB03>c, the environment, urban design, socioeconomic characteristics, etc.).
Using a survey conducted in 2012 of 527 students aged 12–18 years
old attending four high schools located in the city of Granada, Spain,
the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of active commuting for each school have been
determined for four types of distances. The study has two aims: (a) to
examine which of the four types of distances (i.e., Euclidean,
Manhattan, walking-network and driving-network) could be the best
predictor of the decision to walk to school and (b) to determine the
areas of in<U+FB02>uence of ACS for four high schools in the city of Granada,
Spain, considering the distance from home to school and the spatial
dependence between households.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, a
review of the literature on the factors that in<U+FB02>uence children's decision
to walk to school is presented, focusing on the presence of spatial dependence. 
The data and methodology are then described in the following 
section. Finally, the results are discussed and analyzed and
conclusions are drawn, highlighting the most important <U+FB01>ndings of the
research.

2. Literature review

ACS behavior is associated with di<U+FB00>erent demographic, personal,
school, family, environmental and social factors (Chillón et al., 2014;
Hume et al., 2009; Sirard and Slater, 2008). The main predictive factor
of ACS is distance from home to school, which is examined here in
relation to spatial dependence.

2.1. Accessibility, distance and proximity
Geographic information systems (GIS) use di<U+FB00>erent methods to
measure accessibility. The measure of accessibility between two locations 
includes the concept of time, transport mode and physical distance 
(Jang and Kang, 2015). Accessibility can be measured as the
distance, cost or time between two locations. In a study by Apparicio
et al. (2003), the authors examined whether physical distance and time
are correlated, and concluded that at the metropolitan level using distance 
to estimate the shortest network time does not introduce major

error. Geographical proximity can be measured by some type of physical 
distance (i.e., Euclidean, Manhattan, walking-network and
driving-network). Distance is a measure of the proximity between the
household and the school, but is also considered the main barrier to
walking to school (McDonald, 2007b) in addition to other environmental 
variables such as crime and tra<U+FB03>c (Pont et al., 2009). The closer
the household and school are to each other, the greater the probability
that children will walk to school (Chillón et al., 2014). The Euclidean
distance and the Manhattan distance are two common and easy to
calculate measures for determining geographical proximity. The Euclidean 
distance is the straight-line or “as the crow <U+FB02>ies” distance, while
the Manhattan distance is the sum of the horizontal and vertical components 
of a right-angled triangle. Another measure of physical distance
is the shortest network distance on foot or by car (Apparicio et al.,
2008). Of the four types of distances addressed here to measure how
users perceive the concept of proximity, the Euclidean distance is the
shortest, whereas the driving distance is the longest due to the presence
of one-way roads and pedestrian streets (Fig. 1). Golledge and Hubert
discussed how the use of a Euclidean metric can be supported for the
construction of mental maps for interurban analysis (Golledge and
Hubert, 1982). The Euclidean, Manhattan and network distances and
time have been used to measure accessibility to health services
(Apparicio et al., 2017) and green space (Higgs et al., 2012), as well as
walking to green spaces, cycling to public high schools, driving to
health care services, and walking, cycling and driving to supermarkets
(Logan et al., 2017). In this paper, the Euclidean, Manhattan and
shortest network distance on foot and by car are used.

2.2. Spatial dependence in mode choice

Spatial dependence can be de<U+FB01>ned as the existence of a relationship
between what happens at a point of the plane and what happens elsewhere 
(Anselin, 1988). Spatial dependence is also referred to as “spatial
autocorrelation” (Anselin and Rey, 1991), although the notion of spatial 
autocorrelation is more limited than that of spatial dependence
(Anselin and Rey, 1991). In practice, both concepts are usually considered 
the same (Anselin, 1988; Anselin, 1999). However, in the
geostatistics and spatial statistics <U+FB01>elds, Cressie (1991) primarily used
the term “spatial dependence.” To clarify, in the current study, the term
“spatial autocorrelation” refers to a variable or model perturbations (in
the sense of Anselin and Bera, 1998, “as a moment of the joint distribution”) 
and the term “spatial dependence” is used when referring to
the phenomenon under study. The idea of spatial dependence is expressed 
in the First Law of Geography, which posits that “everything is
related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant
things” (Tobler, 1970).
In the case of transport mode choice, spatial dependence is expected
to occur among individuals who are neighbors, since the locational
variables, such as crime rates or tra<U+FB03>c, will have a similar e<U+FB00>ect on
decisions regarding the mode of ACS. For example, a low crime rate in
an area will positively in<U+FB02>uence the decision to walk in that area. In a
context of this type, a positive face-to-face spatial contagion is also
expected, since neighboring individuals will tend to make similar decisions. 
Thus, for example, if an individual decides to walk to school,
this can in<U+FB02>uence their neighbors directly (positive contagion), although 
it could also have an additional indirect e<U+FB00>ect (negative contagion). 
However, because both locational variables and contagion are
often unobservable, they are omitted in the models.
The concept of spatial dependence has been addressed in di<U+FB00>erent
<U+FB01>elds such as ecology, forestry, geology, medical, urban demography
and land use, among others (Anselin and Bera, 1998). These authors
also highlight that spatial dependence is due to certain misspeci<U+FB01>cations 
which result in spatial measurement errors and spatial auto-correlation 
between the perturbances. In this line, Dubin (1988) found
that omitted variables will be included in the error term, causing this
term to be spatially autocorrelated. On the other hand, Galster et al.

(2001) explored a wide variety of concepts related to the land use
patterns (i.e., density, centrality, contiguity, continuity, etc.) that explain 
the level of sprawl, which might be related to the concept of
spatial dependence.
However, few studies have addressed the spatial interaction e<U+FB00>ects
that in<U+FB02>uence children's transport mode choice. These e<U+FB00>ects may occur
because households share common unobserved factors (Sidharthan
et al., 2011) that depend on the location and are di<U+FB03>cult to observe,
measure and specify in a model. These factors could be spatially autocorrelated 
due to spatial interaction in two ways: across spatial zones,
neighborhoods or blocks and across individual behaviors (Rainham
et al., 2012). Another cause of spatial dependence is spatial spread,
since individuals who are close in space are in<U+FB02>uenced by their
neighbors' decisions (contagion), thus prompting other children to
choose the same method of transport (Sidharthan et al., 2011).
The most common barriers to ACS are distance and tra<U+FB03>c (Beck and
Greenspan, 2008; Chillón et al., 2014). Moreover, Beck and Greenspan
(2008) showed that families' behavior is not homogeneous throughout a
geographical area and that their choices may di<U+FB00>er depending on the
area in which they live. Therefore, besides distance, there are other
locational factors that cause school travel choices to be dependent on
location. These locational factors together with the contagion e<U+FB00>ect
may in<U+FB02>uence students' decisions, resulting in a spatial distribution of
that does not form concentric circles around high schools. Indeed, families' 
decisions are likely related to the characteristics a<U+FB00>ecting a
given area, leading to the presence of spatial dependence. Pont et al.
(2009) conducted a review of some of the main factors related to ACS.
The authors investigated the physical, economic, social, cultural and
political factors of active transportation among young people. Of these
factors, we are particularly interested in the environmental characteristics 
of the neighborhood as they have a spatial in<U+FB02>uence on the mode
choice for school transportation (Mitra, 2013). This author (Mitra and
Buliung, 2012) analyzed the presence of scale e<U+FB00>ects on the relationship 
between ACS and the built environment, taking into account the
modi<U+FB01>able areal unit problem (MAUP).
In addition to distance, we address the e<U+FB00>ect of both local, face-to-
face contagion and locational variables that have similar e<U+FB00>ects on
households located in the same area and lead to the presence of spatial
dependence.
On the other hand, the classic logistic regression model assumes that
the decisions of individuals living in nearby houses are independent.
However, locational factors such as crime, tra<U+FB03>c, environmental factors, 
among others, may in<U+FB02>uence these decisions, leading to spatial
dependence. Sidharthan et al. (2011) estimated a spatial autoregressive
model (SAR) to test the e<U+FB00>ect of spatial interdependence on the choice
of transport mode. They found that the decision of an individual related
to children's school trips can a<U+FB00>ect the decisions of other individuals in
their environment. This spread may be due to spatial di<U+FB00>usion, social
spillover and e<U+FB00>ects related to unobserved variables that are spatially
autocorrelated (Anselin, 1988; Ripley, 1981). For example, if a person
decides to use active transport, this could persuade their neighbors to
do the same. Thus, a spatial contagion e<U+FB00>ect occurs by which some
individuals encourage other individuals in their neighborhood to make
similar decisions (Boix and Trullén, 2007). This spread e<U+FB00>ect, in addition 
to the e<U+FB00>ect of locational variables, which will be similar for all
families living in the same area, can lead to the presence of spatial
dependence. In a similar line, Mitra et al. (2010) detected the prevalence 
of walking to and from school for children aged 11–13 years old
in Toronto and the global presence of spatial autocorrelation and the
local clusters of walking trips.
In this paper, the regression-kriging method (RK) is used to achieve
the two main objectives of this work: to determine which of the four
types of distance best explains ACS and the area of in<U+FB02>uence of each
school. To achieve the <U+FB01>rst objective, 16 models have been estimated
(four for each high school) and the results have been compared. To
achieve the second aim, ACS has been predicted taking into account not

only the distance from home to school, but also the presence of spatial     	
autocorrelation among the perturbations. We assume that the presence        	
of spatial correlation is due to the contagion e<U+FB00>ect of neighbors and the   	
locational variables (crime, tra<U+FB03>c, the environment, urban design, socioeconomic 
characteristics, etc.). These predictions have been used to     		
obtain isoprobability maps that represent the area of in<U+FB02>uence of each      	
school.                                                                     		
											
3. Data description
										
3.1. Participants
										
A cross-sectional study was carried out in November 2012. Students      		
aged 12–18 years old attending four high schools (Alhambra, Ganivet,        	
Soto de Rojas and Zaidín high schools) located in the city of Granada       	
were invited to participate in the study. All of the high schools were      	
public with a student body of a low to medium socio-economic level          	
and were located in residential neighborhoods close to the city center of   	
Granada. The schools were recruited using convenience sampling. High        	
schools in Spain are divided into areas of in<U+FB02>uence to give preferential
access to families whose residence or place of work is located within
each school zone. Although there is a limit on the number of students										
per high school, it is compulsory for all students to be admitted to a
high school. A total of 527 adolescents accepted to participate and the									
inclusion criteria was to have provided data on the mode of commuting									
to school and an accurate household address to calculate the distance									
from home to school. The sample represents 43% of all students attending these schools.									
The research ethics committee of the University of Granada approved 
the research and the informed consent procedure (case no. 817).									
The schools that participated in the study were informed about the									
purpose of the research and were responsible for informing the students									
and parents, as well as obtaining their approval and written consent.
																		
3.2. Mode of commuting to/from school                                       
										
The students completed a self-reported questionnaire which included 
questions that have been proposed as the most appropriate            
measure for assessing mode of commuting to school based on a systematic 
review of 158 studies (Herrador-Colmenero et al., 2014). The        
questions have been recently validated in young Spanish people                  
(Chillón et al., 2017). Speci<U+FB01>cally, the students were asked how they       
usually commuted to and from school. The response options were:             
walk, bike, motorbike, car, bus. A dichotomous variable was obtained:       
walking and cycling were categorized as “active commuting,” and the         
use of car, motorbike or bus as “passive or motorized commuting.”               
Respondents who actively commuted on at least one leg of the trip (to       
or from school) were categorized as active or walking, while those who      
passively commuted both to and from school were categorized as passive 
or motorized. Given that most active commuters were walkers (less      
than 0.3% of participants biked to school), a dichotomous variable
walkers vs. motorized commuters was created using the same process          
and omitting those who biked in order to study the criterion distance.                                   
Four types of distances were considered to capture proximity effects: 
the Euclidean distance, the Manhattan distance, the shortest									
walking network distance and the shortest driving distance. The <U+FB01>rst									
two distances (Euclidean and Manhattan) were obtained automatically									
once the 527 households had been georeferenced (Fig. 2) according to									
the following expression (Arafat and Abed Al Musa, 2017):
where u and v are geographical coordinates and p = 1 for the Manhattan 
distance and p = 2 for the Euclidean distance.                       
The two network distances (walking and driving) were calculated         
using Google Maps™ software, which is considered an accurate method             

(Logan et al., 2017). This software allows selecting the origin (the
house), the destination (the school) and the transport mode. Each of the
households (origin) of the students attending the four schools (destinations) 
was located, and the shortest walking network path and
shortest driving network path from home to school was chosen. All the
distances were obtained and expressed in meters. The four distances
were used as the explanatory variable in the 16 models that were estimated 
using logistic regression as discussed in the results section.

3.3. Distance from home to school

The objective measure of the commuting distance from home to
school for each participant was estimated selecting the shortest walking
network path between the home address and the school using Google
Maps™ software. Only in case where it failed to recognize the address,
Via Michelin software was used to locate the address and it was then
manually extrapolated to Google Maps software. The walking distance
from home to school (i.e., distance for those participants who only
walked) was calculated. The distance was collected and expressed in
meters.

4. Methods

Kriging is a method used for spatial prediction in the <U+FB01>eld of
geostatistics. Although there are many variants of kriging, we chose
regression-kriging (RK) because it is the most suitable method when
there are auxiliary variables and it can be more easily combined with
other methods. RK is a spatial interpolation method that combines a
multiple-linear regression model (or a variant of generalized linear
models, generalized additive models, etc.) with kriging of the regression 
residuals (Hengl et al., 2007a; McBratney et al., 2000). This
method has been used in several <U+FB01>elds. Odeh et al. (1995), for instance,
compared di<U+FB00>erent methods and concluded that RK generally performed 
well. In the housing market, an iterative RK method has been
used for the spatial prediction of housing prices and locational rents
(Chica-Olmo, 1995). A network RK method was used to estimate the
ridership of the new Second Avenue Subway in New York City (Zhang
and Wang, 2014), while a mapping methodology was used to analyze
urban structure characteristics and children's active transport (Broberg
et al., 2013).
In our speci<U+FB01>c case, the aim is to obtain isoprobability maps in order
to estimate the likelihood that a child living in any location of the plane
will walk to school. These probabilities are represented on the plane
and permit “drawing” the polygon that determines each school's area of
in<U+FB02>uence.
When the outcome is a binary variable, RK uses a logistic regression.
Other authors (Hengl et al., 2007a) have used RK with logistic regression 
to map the presence/absence of a binary variable and the result
was the probability of occurrence of this variable. The predictions can
be made using the following expression (Hengl et al., 2007b):
where 0 = <U+F0B5> z (s0) = 1 is the estimated response of the binary variable (in
our case this binary variable is the mode of ACS, as we are interested in
predicting z in any location s0); the binary variable is observed in locations 
s1, s2, …sn (the households) where si = (ui, vi) and ui, vi are the
spatial coordinates; m   <U+F0B5> (s0) is the trend (this is the classic logistic regression 
and allows us to obtain the probability that a student will
travel on foot considering the distance from home to school); ß<U+F0B5> is a
vector kx1 of the estimated regression coe<U+FB03>cients; x(s0) is a vector kx1
of the explanatory variables (the distance to school) and e (^ s0) is the
estimated kriging residual. The residuals are estimations of the perturbations 
of the classic logistic regression model.
As indicated in the literature review, ACS behavior is associated

with a range of personal, school, family and social explanatory variables 
(age, income, etc.), which can have an in<U+FB02>uence on the fact that
two students who are at the same distance make di<U+FB00>erent transport
mode choices. However, these personal factors have not been included
in the models presented in this paper because one of the objectives has
been to obtain isoprobability maps, and to obtain such maps the explanatory 
variables must be known at any point of the plane. For example, 
the age of the surveyed individuals is known in the households
where they live, but is not known at any point on the map (s0).
Therefore, we consider an individual with average personal characteristics, 
and assume that the decision made by that individual depends
only on factors related to the location. The isoprobability map shows
how likely that particular individual will be to vary his or her transport
mode choice depending on the location.

Once this individual is selected, the individual's mode of ACS will
vary spatially as a function of the relevant explanatory variables, such
as distance to school, the locational variables and contagion. For various 
reasons, the locational variables and contagion are sometimes not
measured, so they are omitted in the models. We assume that the
omitted variables are present in the perturbations and that the presence
of spatial autocorrelation in them is caused by the omission of these
relevant explanatory variables (Dubin, 1988).
In geostatistics, the key instrument to detect the presence of spatial
dependence is the variogram (Matheron, 1965; Cressie, 1991; Hengl
et al., 2007a; Hengl et al., 2007b; Chica-Olmo, 1995). An unbiased
estimator of the variogram of residuals is (Matheron, 1965):


where (si + h) and (si) are the locations of two households (one located
in si the other located at an ‘h’ distance from the household located in si)
and N(h) is the number of h distant household-pairs, that is, the number
of households that are separated by an ‘h’ distance. The value of the
empirical variogram (<U+03B3>e ^ (h) ) is shown in dots for households that are
separated by an approximate distance of 125 m, 250 m, 375 m and so
on (Fig. 3). It can also be observed how the spatial variability between
the residuals increases as the distance between the households increases.
To perform estimations with the kriging method, it is necessary to <U+FB01>t
a model to the empirical variogram. To do so, we have used the spherical 
and Gaussian variogram models (see Fig. 3).

The model <U+FB01>t depends on three parameters: the nugget e<U+FB00>ect (C0),
the range (a) and the sill (C0 + C), where C is the partial sill. The
nugget e<U+FB00>ect is a measure of a random component, the range is de<U+FB01>ned
by the value of h in which the value of the variogram stabilizes and the
sill is the value that the variogram model attains at the range. The range
in Fig. 3 is 1000 m, meaning that the residuals are spatially auto-correlated 
up to a distance of approximately 1000 m. The Gaussian and
spherical models are two of the most commonly used models in geostatistics 
and represent continuous phenomena (Armstrong, 1998). Both
models show how the distance between houses increases, the variability
between the residuals also increases. This may be due to the fact that
students who live in houses proximate in space are a<U+FB00>ected by similar
locational variables and face-to-face contagion, and logically make similar 
decisions. In contrast, when the distance between the houses increases, 
these variables are less similar and the contagion is smaller,
which leads the students to make less similar decisions. Moreover, the
distances to everything else also increase and the areas may be perceived 
by the students as not very walkable.
A measure of the intensity of the spatial dependence can be investigated 
using the relative nugget e<U+FB00>ect, that is, the ratio of the
nugget e<U+FB00>ect and sill. A ratio of less than 25% indicates strong spatial
dependence, a ratio between 25% and 75% indicates moderate spatial
dependence, and a ratio greater than 75% indicates weak spatial dependence (Rouhani, 1996).

                                                  
This estimator is a weighted average of the known values (e) in the
locations si, and where <U+03BB>i are the kriging weights. These weights are
obtained by minimizing the variance of the estimation error and considering 
the structure of spatial autocorrelation detected with the variogram 
(Matheron, 1965). The advantage to this method is that it
generally provides weights that are greater than the residuals located
closest to the location s0 and smaller weights for those furthest away
from the location.

In our study, expression (2) allows estimating the response of the
<U+F0B5> (s0) , which depends on the distance
binary variable ACS by the sum of m
between the house and the school, and e (^ s0) , which considers the
spatial autocorrelation structure of the residuals. Hence, we assume
that unobserved factors are utilized to improve the prediction by considering 
the spatial autocorrelation of residuals, instead of assuming (as
in classic logistic regression) that they are white noise (Zhang and
Wang, 2014). Expression (2) is an estimator which has the advantage of
allowing estimations at any point of the plane.

5. Results and discussion

The frequency and percentage of students who travel to school on
foot or by motorized modes of transportation are presented in Table 1.
Alhambra High School was found to have the highest percentage of
students who walk to school (84%), while Ganivet High School had the
lowest (57%). The descriptive characteristics of the four types of distances 
used to measure the proximity between home and school are also
shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the mean Euclidean distance is always
the shortest distance for all schools, while the mean driving distance is

always the longest. These results are in line with other studies that show
that the Euclidean distance is shorter than the Manhattan distance and
the network distance (Arafat and Abed Al Musa, 2017). However, an
interesting result of our work is that the mean walking distance and the
mean Manhattan distance are similar. There is not enough evidence to
reject our null hypothesis that the means of the walking distance and
the Manhattan distance are equal, since the p-value was greater than
0.05 for three schools (Alhambra, Soto de Rojas and Zaidín) and greater
than 0.01 for one (Ganivet). By contrast, there is evidence to reject the
null hypothesis that the di<U+FB00>erences between the means of the other
types of distances are equal, since the p-value was always less than 0.01.
Therefore, there are no signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences between the mean
Manhattan distance and the mean walking distance, but there are signi<U+FB01>cant 
di<U+FB00>erences between the other distances. This has practical
implications because it is much more cumbersome to obtain walking
distances than Manhattan distances.
The location of the students' homes and their mode of commuting to
school are shown in Fig. 2. There is a large concentration of households
around the Alhambra, Soto de Rojas and Zaidín high schools, while the
location of the households of students attending Ganivet High School
was more dispersed. Actually, the coe<U+FB03>cient of variation is similar to 1
for the three <U+FB01>rst high schools and 0.59 for Ganivet High School, thus
showing an almost double dispersion in this school (see Table 1). In
addition, this school has the longest average distance between households 
(1722.4 m), which also a<U+FB00>ects the rates of spatial dependence.
Hence, the students at Ganivet High School have lower spatial dependence 
rates as indicated by the high value of the nugget e<U+FB00>ect (r-nug)
for this school (see Table 2).
As can be seen in Fig. 2, the Alhambra, Soto de Rojas and Zaidín
high schools are located in the southern part of the city. This is a
transition zone, with median housing prices and whose inhabitants are
of middle socioeconomic status. However, Ganivel High School is located 
in the downtown area of the city, where housing prices are high
and the socioeconomic status is generally higher, which could be

related to the more frequent use of motorized vehicles (see Table 1).
In this study, 16 logistic regression models were obtained for each of
the four high schools, and four types of distances were performed
(Table 2). In all cases, the coe<U+FB03>cients of the models are signi<U+FB01>cant and
have a negative sign, thus indicating that as the distance increases, the
likelihood of ACS to school decreases. This result coincides with most of
the cases in the study of Pont et al. (2009). In order to compare the
di<U+FB00>erent kinds of distances (for the same school) we have used the
Nagelkerke adjusted R-squared and the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC), which describe a trade-o<U+FB00> between the goodness-of-<U+FB01>t and its
complicity (Burnham and Anderson, 2004). According to these statistics, 
the type of distance that properly explains the transport mode
choice at the Alhambra and Soto de Rojas schools is the Euclidean
distance as the statistical value of AIC is lower. However, the walking
distance shows the best results for the Ganivet and Zaidín schools.
Therefore, the Euclidean and walking distances best express the concept
of proximity between home and school for schools in these types of
environment.
It      is       also   possible      to       calculate     the     AIC
di<U+FB00>erence = <U+0394>i = AICi - AICmin (where AICmin is the minimum value).
A rule of thumb is when <U+0394>i > 10, the model fails to explain some
substantial variation in the data and the best model is when <U+0394>i = 0
(Burnham and Anderson, 2003). In this study, none of the distances
considered in the Alhambra and Zaidín high schools meet the stated
rule, so all distances substantially explain the variation in the data. On

the other hand, the distance by car for the Ganivet and Soto highschools 
ful<U+FB01>lls this rule of thumb. Therefore, the level of empirical
support of this distance to explain ACS in these schools is basically low
or none (Burnham and Anderson, 2003). The low values of <U+0394>i for the
Alhambra and Zaidín high schools are due to the strong correlation
between the di<U+FB00>erent types of distances (see Table 1).
To detect the presence of the contagion e<U+FB00>ect of neighbors and the
locational variables, we have used the experimental variograms of residual 
e(si) and its <U+FB01>tted models, which is expressed in Fig. 4. A spherical 
model was adjusted to all the experimental variograms with the
exception of Alhambra High School, for which a Gaussian model was
<U+FB01>tted. The spherical model is linear for small distances, while the
Gaussian model represents an extremely continuous phenomenon
(Armstrong, 1998). Therefore, the residuals of Alhambra High School
present greater spatial continuity, that is, small changes in the distance
between houses (h) cause small changes in the variance of the residuals.
For the other schools, however, small changes in the distance between
houses lead to major changes in variability. In other words, the contagion 
e<U+FB00>ect of the neighbors and the locational variables is less likely
to vary in space for the students attending Alhambra High School
compared to the other schools. However, this contagion e<U+FB00>ect and the
locational variables vary substantially in the space for the students attending 
Ganivet High School.
The range of the variogram represents the distance at which the
residuals are correlated, that is, the range of spatial dependence. This

means that students living within that range are a<U+FB00>ected by similar
locational variables and face-to-face contagion and make similar decisions. 
However, the residuals associated to the students living at a
further distance from this range are not correlated: when the variogram
reaches the sill, the covariance is canceled (Cressie, 1991). In the present 
study the range is between 1025 (Ganivet High School) and
1630 m (Soto de Rojas High School). Thus, the e<U+FB00>ect of spatial dependence 
between households has a radius of in<U+FB02>uence of about
1000–1600 m. This radius is quite similar to that obtained in other
studies (Broberg et al., 2013). This spatial dependence may be due to
both local or face-to-face contagion e<U+FB00>ects or caused by unobserved
locational variables (crime, tra<U+FB03>c, the environment, urban design, socioeconomic 
characteristics, etc.) that have similar e<U+FB00>ects on households 
located in the same zone.
The ratio of the nugget e<U+FB00>ect in percentages (%) was also obtained
to determine the degree of spatial dependence (r-nug, Table 2). Spatial
dependence was found to be weak for Ganivet High School, moderate
for Soto de Rojas High School and strong for the Alhambra and Zaidín
schools.
It is important to note that a lower percentage of students at Ganivet
High School walk to school. The school also shows higher average
distances to school, as well as a lower degree of spatial dependence
(higher r-nug). In contrast, Alhambra is the high school with the highest
percentage of students who walk. Moreover, although the mean distance 
from home to school is not the lowest (due to its high statistical
dispersion), Alhambra is one of the schools with a greater degree of
spatial dependence because the relationship between the nugget and sill

is lower (lower r-nug). Moreover, the variograms of Alhambra High
School (Fig. 4) showed that students have a low elasticity to distance
between households that are close to each other (0–500 m), since there
is little variability between the residuals of the houses.
In line with the second aim of the study, isoprobability maps were
created to determine the likelihood that a child living anywhere in the
city will actively commute to school (Fig. 5). These maps represent the
areas of in<U+FB02>uence of ACS for four high schools in the city of Granada
taking into account the structure of variability detected by the variograms. 
The estimated probabilities re<U+FB02>ect the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of each
school for each type of distance and have been obtained with RK (expression (2)). 
The red areas indicate the areas with the highest probability 
that a child will walk to school. These areas have been calculated
taking into account the distance from home to school and the spatial
dependence detected with variograms in the unobservable locational
variables (e(si)). The distances that students in these schools will walk
delimit the areas of in<U+FB02>uence. These areas are not circular in shape
because the students' travel mode choices are not a<U+FB00>ected only by the
distance to school, but by other unobservable locational factors that can
be obtained for any point level s0by the kriging method (e (^ s0) ).
To clearly illustrate the results of the RK method, Zaidín High
School has been taken as an example. Fig. 6 shows: (a) the map of ACS
isoprobabilities considering the Euclidean distance and the presence of
autocorrelation between the errors (<U+F0B5>     z (s0) ); (b) the isoprobabilities map
obtained by classic logistic regression considering only the distance
from home to school (m    <U+F0B5> (s0) ) and (c) the map of isovalues of residuals
(e (^ s0) ).

As can be observed, the <U+FB01>nal result for ACS (<U+F0B5>       z (s0) ) is a<U+FB00>ected not
only by the distance from home to school (m          <U+F0B5> (s0) ), but also by the
contagion e<U+FB00>ect and other locational variables that have not been included 
in the model (e (^ s0) ). It is clearly observed that if only distance is
considered, the probability of walking to school would have a homogeneous 
spatial distribution in the form of concentric circles around the
school. However, the presence of autocorrelation among the residuals
caused by other locational factors deforms these concentric circles,
resulting in an irregular isoprobabilities map.

5.1. Study limitations

One of the main limitations of this work is that only one locational
variable (distance) has been used to explain the ACS model. The inclusion 
of other locational variables (crime, tra<U+FB03>c, the environment,
urban design, socioeconomic characteristics, etc.) would have improved 
the overall understanding of the ACS model, but were not
measured because it was not on the aims of the study. Moreover, these
variables are often unavailable or di<U+FB03>cult or costly to measure.
However, we consider that the omission of these variables does not
invalidate the results obtained in this work since the global e<U+FB00>ect of
these factors on ACS has been considered indirectly by taking into account 
the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the model perturbations
caused by omitting these locational variables. Other limitations include
the convenience sampling of the participants: the sample is limited to
Spanish youth from southeastern Spain. Nonetheless, the sample size is
quite large. The main strengths in the current study was the use of a
valid questionnaire to measure children's commuting to school. An
additional strength of the work was the objective measurement of the
area of in<U+FB02>uence of each school.


6. Conclusions and policy implications

This study has analyzed the spatial distribution of households with
students who travel to four high schools located in Granada, Spain. Four
di<U+FB00>erent distances were examined to explain the e<U+FB00>ect of proximity
between the homes and the schools and measure the e<U+FB00>ect of each
distance and the presence of spatial dependence on the decision to walk
to school. The analysis has permitted us to determine the area of in<U+FB02>uence 
of each school.
The Euclidean distance has traditionally been considered to explain
the mode of commuting (Pont et al., 2009). The results we have obtained 
indicate that the two types of distances that best explain the
decision to walk to school are the Euclidean distance and the walking
distance. Moreover, the presence of spatial dependence e<U+FB00>ects arising
from interactions among geographically close households has also been
observed. In general, the spatial dependence produced by locational
variables and spatial contagion by the students is moderate to strong,
except for Ganivet High School, for which it is weak. In addition, the
spatial range of the locational variables and the contagion e<U+FB00>ect is
approximately 1000 m to 1600 m. These <U+FB01>ndings have policy implications 
since the transport mode choice of the students is in<U+FB02>uenced by
locational variables and neighbors' decisions. They also highlight the
need for public institutions to improve the surrounding environment of
the schools in order to increase their walkable area of in<U+FB02>uence to
promote active commuting to school reiterating its social bene<U+FB01>ts and
promote a “domino e<U+FB00>ect” regarding individuals' decisions. These interventions 
would decrease negative behavoir patterns (i.e., passive
commuting to school). In addiction, identifying these walkable areas
may be of interest for local services such as restaurants, supermarkets,
shops, etc. It is our hope that this study will provide some interesting
insights.
Recent developments in GIS have opened up new opportunities for
the use of spatial methodologies (Broberg and Sarjala, 2015). RK could
be implemented in a GIS to allow state agencies and municipalities to
determine the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of schools and aid urban designers and
planners in developing neighborhoods that support ACS in order to feed
into policy decisions.
