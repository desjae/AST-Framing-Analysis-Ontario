Household interactions and children’s school travel: the e<U+FB00>ect
of parental work patterns on walking and biking to school

Abstract
This study evaluates how household interactions a<U+FB00>ect walking and biking to school. The cross
sectional research design uses a representative 
sample of trips to school by US youth (n = 8231) to test how parental employment status and commute patterns a<U+FB00>ect non-motorized
travel. Results from a binary logit model show that young children (5–14) with mothers who commute to work in the morning
are less likely to walk or bike to school after controlling for individual, household, and neighborhood factors. Policymakers may therefore 
want to create programs that allow parents to share chaperoning responsibilities for the school trip to address parental time
constraints.

1. Introduction                                                               
										
From 1980 to 2002, the proportion of overweight children 
aged 6 to 19 tripled in the United States (Ogden                         
et al., 2006). At the same time, levels of physical activity                  
have declined. To combat these trends, policymakers in                        
the United States have set a goal of having 50% of children                   
with trips of less than one mile walk to school by 2010 (US                   
Department of Health and Human Services, 2000). E<U+FB00>orts                        
to achieve this have focused on improving the infrastructure 
for walking and biking and educating students about                      
non-motorized options. However, there has been less consideration 
of how household interactions, particularly                        
coordination between parents’ work and children’s school                      
schedules, a<U+FB00>ect the decision to walk and bike to school.                     
Previous research in childhood geography and travel                       
behavior suggests that intra-household connections place                      
strong constraints on what activities people can participate                  
in and how they can get there. Understanding these constraints 
is critical to creating e<U+FB00>ective interventions aimed
at increasing walking to school. The goal of this study is
to consider how household interactions a<U+FB00>ect non-motorized 
travel to school to see if policies beyond infrastructure
and education might be important strategies for achieving
national goals for walking to school. Speci<U+FB01>cally, this study
asks: (1) who children travel with on the school trip and (2)
how parental employment status and work travel patterns
in<U+FB02>uence children’s walking and biking to school.
I <U+FB01>nd evidence that the work status of mothers – but not
fathers – is associated with walking and biking to school.
Speci<U+FB01>cally, children whose mothers work full time and
commute to work in the morning are less likely to walk
or bike to school than students with mothers not leaving
for work in the morning. This suggests that parental time
constraints need to be addressed if policymakers hope to
increase rates of active school travel. The following sections 
provide an overview of current research on children’s
travel, describe the study methodology, and present
research <U+FB01>ndings. The <U+FB01>nal section of the paper explores
how policy options for increasing walking and biking to
school can accommodate parental time constraints.

2. Children’s travel

Rates of walking to school vary widely across the globe.
Less than 15% of US schoolchildren walked or biked to
school in 2001 (Martin and Carlson, 2005). This compares
with a walking rate of approximately 50% for British children 
in 1999–2001 and 27% of children in Melbourne, Australia 
in 1993–1996 (Ampt, 1996; Pooley et al., 2005). There
have been well-documented declines in walking to school in
the United States and the United Kingdom in recent decades 
(McDonald, 2007; Pooley et al., 2005).
Part of the decline in walking to school may be related
to an overall decrease in children’s independent spatial
mobility. In their seminal study, Hillman et al. (1990)
showed that English schoolchildren had less travel freedom
in 1990 than in 1971. In 1970, 94% of 10 and 11 year old
British children were allowed to walk to school unaccompanied 
by an adult (Hillman et al., 1990). By 1990 the number 
was 54% and in 1998 the number was 47% (O’Brien
et al., 2000). This suggests that parents are changing their
de<U+FB01>nition of when it is safe to let a child walk to school
unaccompanied.
Other studies have also found a decline in independent
travel, but have shown that context moderates the e<U+FB00>ects.
O’Brien et al. (2000) found that children’s freedom was
higher in a lower-density new town than London. Similarly, 
Kytta (1997) showed that Finnish children in rural
areas had more travel freedom than peers in a city and
small town.
This decrease in travel freedom may be associated with
parental concerns about tra<U+FB03>c dangers and the risk of
abduction or harassment (Beuret and Camara, 1998; diGiuseppi 
et al., 1998; Martin and Carlson, 2005; Surface
Transportation Policy Project, Transportation and Land
Use Coalition, & Latino Issue Forum, 2003; Tranter,
1996). Parents of younger children (5–11 years) may be
most concerned with these issues. For example, over 40%
of the parents of primary school-aged children reported
that their children faced tra<U+FB03>c obstacles; closer to 30% of
parents of older children listed this as a barrier (Dellinger,
2002). Geographers have noted that safety concerns have
led parents to limit the time children spend playing in public 
spaces, and the safety-imposed restrictions are more
severe for girls than boys (Valentine, 1997b).
Walking rates for children are also a<U+FB00>ected by individual-level 
factors, particularly age and sex. Girls are less
likely to walk than boys are with the di<U+FB00>erences being most
prominent at younger ages (Evenson et al., 2003; McMillan
et al., 2006; O’Brien et al., 2000) and in suburban areas
(Vliet, 1983). Household factors such as car ownership
a<U+FB00>ect mode choice (Bradshaw and Atkins, 1996; diGiuseppi 
et al., 1998). The built environment appears to exert
a small, but signi<U+FB01>cant, e<U+FB00>ect on walking to school. In a
study of Oregon middle schools, Schlossberg et al. (2006)
found that urban form – as measured by higher intersection
densities and lower proportions of dead-ends – was associated 
with walking to school. McMillan’s (2007) study of

California elementary students found a modest relationship
between urban form and walking. Boarnet et al. (2005) and
Staunton et al. (2003) have shown that changes in the built
environment, such as sidewalk and street crossing improvements, 
an make students more likely to walk to school.
Analyses of walking by youths aged 5–18 in the Atlanta
region found that the e<U+FB00>ect of urban form factors such as
intersection density, residential density, and mixed land
uses on walking was moderated by household vehicle
access and income (Kerr et al., 2007). In that study, youth
from families with more vehicle access and higher incomes
exhibited stronger associations between walking and urban
form.

2.1. Household interactions

Analyses of travel suggest the presence of children has a
strong e<U+FB00>ect on adult travel patterns. Jones (1979) showed
that a small change in school starting time a<U+FB00>ected the travel 
patterns of every household member. Rosenbloom
(1987) found that the presence of children had a stronger
e<U+FB00>ect on maternal, as opposed to paternal, travel behavior.
More recently, modelers have attempted to use household
interactions to predict activity scheduling and tripmaking
(see Transportation 32(5) for a review of current intrahousehold 
modeling e<U+FB00>orts). Travel models that incorporate 
household interactions have shown that the presence
of children a<U+FB00>ects adult activity and travel scheduling (Gliebe 
and Koppelman, 2005). While this research con<U+FB01>rms
that household interactions are important to understanding 
travel behavior, the computational intensity of the
models has often led to a focus on adult behavior or a limited 
set of activities.
An exception to this is the work of Vovsha and Petersen
(2005) and Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2007). Using data
from Atlanta, Vovsha and Petersen (2005) found that
40% of children are escorted on the way to school and
35% on the way home and household females were most
likely to escort children. They found that having a school
within walking distance did not reduce demand for escorting 
in the morning (although it did in the afternoon). However, 
their analysis only considered automobile trips.
Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2007), in a sample of San
Francisco Bay Area households, found that mothers traveling 
to work were less likely to walk their children to
school and more likely to drive them. The travel behavior
of fathers had less in<U+FB02>uence.

3. Methodology

3.1. Design and sample

This study uses a cross-sectional research design to
explore the importance of household interactions on children’s 
school travel. Chi-square tests and binary logit models 
identify the role of household interactions in rates of
walking and biking to school for a national sample of

US youth. Data for the analysis come from the National
Household Travel Survey (NHTS), a population-based,
random-digit dial phone and mail survey which captures
information on all trips undertaken by household members
on a designated survey day as well as socio-demographic
information (for complete details of survey design see the
NHTS User’s Guide (US Department of Transportation,
2004)). The survey, which was collected by contractors to
the US Department of Transportation between March
2001 and May 2002, gathered information on 66,000
households in the United States and had a weighted
person-level response rate of 34.1%. This analysis focuses
on 8231 children between the ages of 5 and 18 who traveled
between home and school on the morning of the survey day
and for whom complete household socio-demographic
information including number of vehicles owned, household 
size and composition, and household income are
available.

3.2. Measures

The primary unit of analysis is the child’s trip tour
between home and school. School destinations were determined 
by a trip purpose of ‘‘go to school as a student.” For
each child, we compiled information on their trip to school,
household demographics, and neighborhood characteristics. 
If the survey recorded multiple tours between home
and school for a child, only the <U+FB01>rst tour was used in the
analysis.

3.2.1. Trip characteristics
Following Cervero and Duncan (2003), distance
between home and school is the primary measure of the
trip. In the 2001 NHTS, distances were self-reported in
either blocks or miles. Following Agrawal and Schimek
(2007) who showed that the standard NHTS coding of
short trip distances is inaccurate because many trips of less
than a half mile are coded as ‘‘0 miles”, I recoded any trip
reported as ‘‘0 blocks” to 0.055 miles (based on the NHTS’
assumption that a block is 1/9 of a mile) and recoded trips
reported as ‘‘0 miles” to 0.25 miles (using the midpoint of
the interval from 0 to 0.5 miles). For cases where students
made intermediate stops between home and school, trip
distance was calculated as the sum of the distance for each
unlinked trip between home and school.

3.2.2. Individual, household, and neighborhood
characteristics
The child’s age and sex were the primary measures of
individual characteristics. In the NHTS, only the race of
the <U+FB01>rst household respondent – often the mother or father
– is recorded. Therefore race and ethnicity were measured
at the household level. Information on household income
and number of vehicles per licensed driver were also
extracted from demographic questions. The DOT contracted 
with Claritas, Inc. to add a measure of residential
density at the block group level. Because this was a
national survey, it was impossible to obtain richer measures 
of local land use.

3.2.3. Household interactions
The NHTS gathers information on relationships among
all household respondents making it possible to identify
mothers and fathers (or primary guardians) for each child.
Trip records also indicate which family members were on
the trip and whether any non-household members accompanied 
the child. For de<U+FB01>nitional purposes, children riding
the school bus were classi<U+FB01>ed as traveling with non-household 
members.
Information on mother and fathers’ work status, occupation, 
education, and distance to work were incorporated
into the children’s travel records. Data on parents’ travel
mode to work and time departing for work on survey
day were also included using two dummy variables for each
parent: mother/father travels to work in am and mother/
father travels to work in pm (reference category: mother/
father not in paid labor force). Mother/father travel to
work in am equated to the parent traveling to work before
10 am on the survey day. Data on siblings, including the
number of siblings, and ages of oldest and youngest sibling,
were also calculated and included in the <U+FB01>nal dataset.

3.3. Analysis

Chi-square analyses were used to examine the relationship 
between travel mode to school, travel companions
for the school trip and mother’s work status. Binary logit
models of children’s non-motorized school travel (de<U+FB01>ned
as walking or biking) were also computed to more directly
control for individual, household and neighborhood-level
covariates. Variables were included in the <U+FB01>nal model if
they were signi<U+FB01>cant at the 90% level or if there was a
strong theoretical reason for keeping them in the model.
Separate models were estimated for elementary and middle
school students (ages 5–14) and high school students (ages
15–18) due to expected behavioral di<U+FB00>erences (Evenson
et al., 2003; Hillman et al., 1990). Person-level sample
weights supplied by the DOT were applied to account for
the strati<U+FB01>ed survey sampling design.
For the binary logit models, only students living within
3 miles of their school (representing 93% of walking and
99% of biking trips to school) were included in the analysis.
This criteria, which follows Cervero and Duncan’s (2003)
approach in studying adult walking behavior, ensured only
trips which could reasonably be completed by walking or
biking were studied. In addition, only children from twoparent 
households were considered in the binary logit models 
in order to assess the di<U+FB00>erential impact of mothers and
fathers on children’s active school travel. These restrictions
reduced the sample size to 4059 students from 2579 households. 
The presence of siblings in the sample required the
use of robust coe<U+FB03>cient standard errors to account for correlations 
in behavior between children from the same
household.

3.3.1. Interpreting model results

Coe<U+FB03>cients from logit models tend to be uninformative
at face value; therefore odds ratios, marginal e<U+FB00>ects, and

predicted probabilities are presented. The odds ratio represents 
how much a 1 unit change in the independent variable
will a<U+FB00>ect the likelihood of walking or biking versus not
walking or biking. Marginal e<U+FB00>ects represent the e<U+FB00>ect of
a 1 unit change in the independent variable on the probability 
of walking or biking (Ben-Akiva and Lerman,

1985). This study reports the average marginal e<U+FB00>ect by
computing e<U+FB00>ects for each variable at the individual-level
and then averaging over the sample. Several authors have
shown this is preferable to computing the e<U+FB00>ects on the
‘average individual’ because of the non-linear shape of
the probability curve (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985; Train,
2003). The predicted probability of walking for certain
variables of interest, e.g., parental work status, are also
presented to give a sense of the absolute e<U+FB00>ects.

4. Results

The students in this sample make 55% of their trips to
school via the private automobile; school buses are the
other dominant mode, accounting for 31% of trips. Walking 
accounts for 12.5% of trips; biking represents 0.8%.
Modal patterns vary substantially across the country
(Fig. 1). Walking rates are highest in the western United
States with the Paci<U+FB01>c and Mountain census divisions having 
18% of students walking to school. The lowest rates of
walking, 1%, were reported in the East South Central division 
that includes Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, 
Virginia, and West Virginia.
Data on travel companions reveal that students make
11% of school trips by themselves. Within the household,
mothers are most likely to be the child’s travel companion
(30%) and are very likely to drive children to school.
Fathers (11%) and siblings (6%) are also important travel
companions. Children make a large portion of trips

(40%) with non-household members, generally on the
school bus.
The importance of household interactions in mode
choice for school trips is strongly moderated by the child’s
age (Fig. 2). Until children reach driving age, they rely
heavily on their mothers. These <U+FB01>ndings con<U+FB01>rm results
from earlier studies that showed that mothers had primary
responsibility for children’s travel (Rosenbloom, 1987;
Rosenbloom and Burns, 1993). Once students reach driving 
age, they are much more likely to travel by themselves
because they have access to automobiles but also because
they have permission to travel further on their own (Hillman 
et al., 1990; Valentine, 1997b). The proportion of trips
made with fathers does not vary strongly with age again
showing the di<U+FB00>erences in paternal and maternal travel
behavior.
Combining children’s travel mode with companionship
information shows that mothers drive 27% of children to
school; this is second only to the school bus in mode/companionship 
share (Table 1). Table 1 also reveals that
mother’s work status strongly in<U+FB02>uences whether children

walk to school. In two-parent households, children of                          
mothers employed outside the home exhibit di<U+FB00>erent modal                       
choice (v2 = 74.27, df = 5, p < 0.0001) and companionship                      
patterns (v2 = 39.89, df = 4, p < 0.0001) than children                        
whose mother is a homemaker. Di<U+FB00>erences in walking rates                           
account for most of the variation in behavior between children 
whose mothers are at home and those working outside                       
the home. While the overall walking rate di<U+FB00>ers signi<U+FB01>cantly 
(8.8% vs. 15.2%, v2 = 70.08, df = 1, p < 0.0001)                        
between the groups, the most striking di<U+FB00>erence occurs                         
for walking trips made with mothers. Children of mothers                       
in the paid labor force make 0.5% of their school trips by                     
walking with their mothers, while children whose mothers                       
are at home make 5.2% of trips to school by walking with                       
their mothers (v2 = 158.31, df = 1, p < 0.0001).                               
										
4.1. Binary logit model                                                        
									
Before considering the e<U+FB00>ect of household interactions                     
on school travel, it is useful to review the e<U+FB00>ects of trip,                       
individual, household, and neighborhood factors to see                         
how they correspond to previous research. The models of                        
non-motorized travel to school show that a critical factor                     
in walking to school is trip distance (Table 2). Each mile                     
of distance between home and school decreases the probability 
of walking or biking to school by 21% points for elementary 
and middle school students and 14 points for high                      
school students. These <U+FB01>ndings con<U+FB01>rm results from studies                         
in Australia (Timperio et al., 2006), Oregon (Schlossberg                      

et al., 2006), Florida (Ewing and Greene, 2003), California
(McMillan, 2007), England (Black et al., 2001), and the
United States (McDonald, 2008a) which also found distance 
to be a critical factor.
Holding all other factors constant, walking rates increase
by 2% points per year as children age which concurs with
the <U+FB01>ndings of previous research (Hillman et al., 1990; Joshi
and Maclean, 1995). The e<U+FB00>ect is only signi<U+FB01>cant in children
5–14. For older students, having a driver’s license decreases
the probability of active travel by 9% points. Because such a
large proportion of older students are licensed this means
that the likelihood of walking plateaus or declines during
high school. Other individual covariates were also important. 
For 5–14 year olds, girls were less likely to walk to
school with being female decreasing the probability of walking 
by 5% points. There was no e<U+FB00>ect of gender for high
school students. This <U+FB01>nding supports the results of previous 
studies of gender and school travel in younger children
(Hillman et al., 1990; McMillan et al., 2006).
The odds of walking to school increase by a factor of 3.2
for Hispanic students aged 5–14. Other minorities are also
more likely to walk to school than whites are, but those
coe<U+FB03>cients are on the margin of statistical signi<U+FB01>cance
(p = 0.10). In a detailed analysis of the e<U+FB00>ects of race and
ethnicity on active school travel, McDonald (2008b) found
that racial di<U+FB00>erences may be best explained by automobile
access and household income.
The density of the local neighborhood (de<U+FB01>ned as the
block group) has a signi<U+FB01>cant positive association with


active travel for younger and older students. For example
the reference person living at New York City-type densities                              
(25,000 people per square mile) would have a predicted
probability of walking or biking to school of 15%; the same
Prob (Walk/Bike)
person living at Atlanta-like densities (3000 people per 
square mile) would have a 11% likelihood of active commuting 
for the same length trip. This con<U+FB01>rms <U+FB01>ndings in                                                         
adult travel that density has a modestly positive association
with the amount of walking (Cervero and Kockelman,                                      
1997; Ewing and Cervero, 2001; Lee and Moudon, 2006).                                  

4.1.1. Household interactions                               

The model shows that household interactions are important 
in the decision to walk to school. Speci<U+FB01>cally, the            		
probability of younger children walking or biking to school       
decreases by 8% points when their mother commuted to
work in the morning. In contrast, high school students
were more likely to use active modes when their mothers
went to work although the e<U+FB00>ect was not statistically significant. 
Children of mothers who held jobs outside the home
but did not leave for work in the mornings did not experience 
a statistically e<U+FB00>ect on their active travel.
The work and travel behavior of fathers had a less signi<U+FB01>cant 
impact on students’ use of active modes for school
travel in either model. For elementary and middle school
students, having a father that travels to work in the morning 
increases the likelihood of walking to school by 7%
points, but the estimated coe<U+FB03>cient is at the edge of statistical 
signi<U+FB01>cance (p = 0.06). It is not clear from theory or
other empirical evidence why this is the case.
These <U+FB01>ndings suggest that mothers traveling to work in          
the morning <U+FB01>nd it more convenient to drop younger children 
at school on their way to work rather than walking                
with them. McMillan (2007) in a survey of elementary                
school primary caregivers found that the convenience of             
driving for parents decreased walking and biking to school.         
Data from the United Kingdom also showed that convenience 
was a primary reason for dropping children at                
school (Bradshaw, 1995; Joshi and Maclean, 1995). Considering 
over 90% of work trips are made by auto and there          
are 1.06 cars per licensed driver in this country (Hu and           
Reuscher, 2004), it is not surprising younger children are          
less likely to walk when their mothers have to get to work.         
The data also show that the mother’s work trip had either              
no e<U+FB00>ect or actually increased non-motorized travel for             
older children. This <U+FB01>nding re<U+FB02>ects the increased independence 
of high school students and the importance of driving.
It seems likely that a mother who drives to work               
makes it less likely that a vehicle will be available for the       
teen; this requires them to <U+FB01>nd an alternate means of getting to school.                                                     
To better understand how the mother’s commute a<U+FB00>ects             
children’s behavior, Fig. 3 shows the probability of walking        
or biking to school for trips of di<U+FB00>erent distances when the        
mother travels to work in the morning, the mother commutes 
to work in the afternoon, or the mother is not in             
the paid labor force. All other factors are held at their           

mean. The graphs demonstrate that elementary and middle
school students with mothers who leave for work in the
morning (‘‘AM Commuters”) have the lowest probability
of non-motorized travel.
Having siblings is associated with higher rates of walking 
and biking for high school students, but there is no signi<U+FB01>cant 
e<U+FB00>ect for elementary students. Our original
hypothesis was that children with more siblings would be
more likely to walk and bike across all ages. The data do
not support this hypothesis that may re<U+FB02>ect the declining
importance of the sibling caretaker in today’s middle-class
families (Valentine, 1997a).

5. Conclusions

This study shows that across the United States: (1)
household interactions are important because children
make nearly half of their school trips with a family member
and (2) the commute patterns of the mother is signi<U+FB01>cantly
associated with walking and biking to school for children
aged 5–14. These <U+FB01>nding extend previous research showing
mothers often have primary responsibility for children’s
travel (Raux and Rosenbloom, 1986; Rosenbloom, 1987;
Rosenbloom and Burns, 1993) and that parental convenience 
is an important criteria for mode choice (Bradshaw,
1995; Joshi and Maclean, 1995; McMillan, 2007).
The implication of these <U+FB01>ndings is that policymakers
and advocates wishing to increase pedestrianism among
youth need to consider options that address parental time
constraints. Current policies designed to increase active
commuting to school, e.g. SR2S, focus on engineering
improvements to increase safety along the route to school.
While this is certainly a necessary step, it may not be su<U+FB03>cient 
to increase walking rates. SR2S programs may be
more e<U+FB00>ective when they couple engineering and safety
improvements with programs that reduce the need for parents 
to accompany their children to school. One program
that may accomplish this is the walking school bus where
parents share responsibility for taking a group of children
from their neighborhood to the school (Martin and Carlson, 
2005). By taking turns escorting children to school,
parents are able to minimize the required time. Several

areas have embraced this program (although some schools
have noted liability concerns (Baker, 2004)). However,
walking school buses do little to increase children’s independent 
mobility (Kearns et al., 2003).
