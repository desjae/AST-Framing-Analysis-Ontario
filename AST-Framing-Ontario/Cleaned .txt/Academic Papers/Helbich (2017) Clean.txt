Children’s school commuting in the Netherlands: Does it matter how urban form is
incorporated in mode choice models?

abstract
Walking and cycling to school is environmentally sustainable and increases children’s physical activity. 
Although it is known that the built environment in<U+FB02>uences children’s travel behavior, there is scant  
knowledge of how urban form along children’s commuting routes affects walking and cycling separately, or   
of how to incorporate urban form exposures in transport mode choice models. This research investigated (a)                                              
the associations between children’s transport mode choice and urban form correlates en route, and (b) the                                        
consequences of different urban form operationalizations (i.e., individual variables, composite measure, and                               
principal components [PCs]). Global Positioning System devices were used to track 623 trips to and from          
school made by Dutch children aged 6–11 years. Urban form exposures were derived with geographic    
information systems, and their relationships with mode choice were tested with mixed multinomial logit     
models in a cross-sectional research design. Differences between the number of associated urban form    
variables, their magnitudes, and their signi<U+FB01>cance levels were found for both walking and cycling,
independent of the operationalization. Urban form was most in<U+FB02>uential for walking, whereas distance-related
effects were absorbed when modeled as PCs. The highest model <U+FB01>t was achieved through PCs; the
composite measure resulted in the lowest <U+FB01>t. To maximize the effectiveness of planning and health
interventions, walking and cycling must be targeted separately. Policymakers should avoid “one-<U+FB01>ts-all
policies,” which are deemed to be inef<U+FB01>cient. Because urban form affects model interpretation and <U+FB01>t, careful
attention should be paid to how urban form is modeled, and sensitivity analyses should be performed.

1. Introduction
												
Although children’s physical activity has been declining signi<U+FB01>cantly 
for many years (Sallis et al., 2015), physical activity is a                            
crucial means to reduce the risk of adverse health conditions in                                    
children (Bauman et al., 2012). In the Netherlands, only 18% of                                
children perform the recommended 60 min of physical activity                                   
a day (Hildebrandt et al., 2013). Suf<U+FB01>cient physical activity is                               
particularly relevant for young age cohorts, since healthy                                     
behaviors during childhood translate into healthier lifestyles in                              
adulthood (Janssen & Leblanc, 2010).                                                           
School commuting provides a vital opportunity to increase                                 
children’s energy expenditure (Faulkner, Buliung, Flora, &                                     
Fusco, 2009; Bauman et al., 2012; Larouche, Saunders,                                          
Faulkner, Colley, & Tremblay, 2014; Duncan et al., 2015).                                      
Besides individual health bene<U+FB01>ts, walking and cycling as a utilitarian 
source of transport induce environmental bene<U+FB01>ts (e.g.,                                
a carbon-neutral transport mode, reduction of traf<U+FB01>c congestions 
during peak hours around schools) (Fishman, B€ocker, &                                   
Helbich, 2015; Nieuwenhuijsen, Khreis, Verlinghieri, &                                         
Rojas-Rueda, 2016; van Wee & Ettema, 2016). Despite these                                           
associated co-bene<U+FB01>ts, the number of children who engage in                                    
active school traveling has reduced (Ferrari & Green, 2013),                                   

while chauffeuring is on the rise in the Netherlands and other
countries (Fyhri & Hjorthol, 2009; Carver, Timperio, &
Crawford, 2013).
Commuting mode choice is a complex decision-making process 
involving both parents and children (Mitra, 2013; Zhou,
2016). In addition to children’s individual characteristics
(e.g., age, gender) (Steinbach, Green, & Edwards, 2012; Kaplan,
Nielsen, & Prato, 2016), trip-speci<U+FB01>c issues also matter (Pont,
Ziviani, Wadley, Bennett, & Abbott, 2009). In particular, the
commuting distance is inversely associated with mode choice:
Children who live closer to school have a higher likelihood of
walking and cycling there (Ewing, Schroeer, & Greene, 2004;
Yeung, Wearing, & Hills, 2008; Larson et al., 2009). Literature
also indicates that stranger danger, traf<U+FB01>c safety, and traf<U+FB01>c
speed in<U+FB02>uence mode choice (Pont et al., 2009; Carver et al.,
2013). For example, not having to cross major roads and the
availability of sidewalk and bike infrastructure are supportive
for safe walking and cycling (Kerr et al., 2006; Helbich et al.,
2016).
Meta-analysis (Ewing & Cervero, 2010) and reviews on children’s 
travel behavior indicate associations with urban form (Pont
et al., 2009; Van Loon & Frank, 2015). Because urban form

encompasses a myriad of components (Cervero & Kockelman,
1997; Brownson, Hoehner, Day, Forsyth, & Sallis, 2009), studies
(Panter, Jones, Van Sluijs, & Grif<U+FB01>n, 2010; Wong, Faulkner, &
Buliung, 2011) frequently operationalize it through density,
diversity, and design indicators (Ewing & Cervero, 2010). In theory, 
density reduces distances between places, which stimulates
both walking and cycling (Van Loon & Frank, 2015). Land-use
diversity is also grounded on a similar distance-based notion.
Saelens and Handy (2008) argue that a pronounced land-use
mix brings destinations closer together, and is associated with
less chauffeuring. However, <U+FB01>ndings concerning land-use and
building diversity are con<U+FB02>icting for children’s transport behavior
(Larson et al., 2009). Urban design is represented by means of
the street layout (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Koohsari et al., 2016).
Here, the assumption is that dense street patterns characterized
by high junction densities or a large number of well-connected
streets support walking and cycling by increasing route choice
and accessibility (Schlossberg, Greene, Phillips, Johnson, &
Parker, 2006; Helbich et al., 2016). Although well-connected
streets are associated with reduced automobile speeds, children
need to cross streets more often, increasing the risk of traf<U+FB01>c
accidents (Sirard & Slater, 2008). Cul-de-sacs, in contrast,
weaken network connectivity, impeding walkability but not necessarily 
cyclability (Ferrari & Green, 2013). Because these measures 
are limited to the horizontal dimension of urban form,
Helbich et al. (2016) extended urban morphology measures to
the third dimension, where the urban topography is represented
through laser scanning data (Helbich, Jochem, M€     ucke, & H€o<U+FB02>e,
2013). As argued, building height differences might stimulate
active commuting. However, there is still controversy over the
associations with and the extent of urban form on children’s
mode choice (Sirard & Slater, 2008; Pont et al., 2009; Mitra,
2013; Van Loon & Frank, 2015).
There are three reasons why the relationships are not
universally found. The <U+FB01>rst reason is methodological, that is,
the way urban form exposures are modeled. While exposures
are primarily restricted to areas either around the home or the
school location, or both (Larsen et al., 2009; Panter et al., 2010),
en route exposures appear increasingly as signi<U+FB01>cant determinants 
of travel behavior (Badland, Scho<U+FB01>eld, & Garrett, 2008;
Duncan, Badland, & Mummery, 2009; B€         ocker, Dijst, Farber, &
Helbich, 2015; Helbich et al., 2016). Straight-line distances
(Steinbach et al., 2012; Owen et al., 2012) or shortest path distances 
(M€  uller, Tscharaktschiew, & Haase, 2008) between
home and school are utilized to mimic the actual path. Both
approximations are questionable, however, as the Euclidean
distance tends to underestimate actual distances (Stigell &
Schantz, 2011) and the shortest routes are considered insuf<U+FB01>ciently 
accurate (Krenn, Oja, & Titze, 2014; Harrison, Burgoine,
Corder, Van Sluijs, & Jones, 2014). To circumvent this shortcoming, 
the Global Positioning System (GPS) (Kerr, Duncan,
& Schipperjin, 2011), in combination with geographic information 
systems (GIS), is increasingly used to model route-speci<U+FB01>c
exposures (Park & Kwan, 2017).
Second, apart from a few exceptions (Schlossberg et al., 2006;
Steinbach et al., 2012), different modes are not analyzed separately.
It is common practice to combine walking and cycling into a single
category called active modes (Bringolf-Isler et al., 2008; Larson
et al., 2009; Broberg, Salminen, & Kytt€a, 2013). However, as

highlighted by several authors (Giles-Corti, Timperio, Bull, &
Pikora, 2005; Wong et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2014; Kaplan et al.,
2016), walking and cycling refer to dissimilar behaviors that are
probably affected by different urban form correlates, or by correlates 
that differ in their effect size (De Vries, Hopman-Rock, Bakker, 
Hirasing, & Van Mechelen, 2010; Aarts, Mathijssen, Van
Oers, & Schuit, 2013). Failure to analyze different modes separately 
might result in suboptimal outcomes and less effective interventions 
(Giles-Corti et al., 2005; Panter et al., 2010). There is
therefore a need to break the analyses down beyond a dichotomization 
into active and passive modes.
Finally, there is no consensus on how to incorporate urban
form in mode choice models. The common practice is to
model them as individual covariates (Schlossberg et al., 2006;
Broberg & Sarjala, 2015). But since these variables tend to be
strongly associated, multicollinearity arises, which is a problem 
that has thus far been disregarded (Wong et al., 2011;
Lu et al., 2014). Frank et al. (2006, 2010) therefore developed
a composite measure based on intra-related urban form components 
repeatedly constructed in studies (Kerr et al., 2006;
Brownson et al., 2009; Manaugh & El-Geneidy, 2011).
Another alternative is to summarize the core information of
urban form variables through a few, but uncorrelated, latent
variables by means of principal component analysis (PCA)
(Broberg et al., 2013).
The present research addressed these three research gaps. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the <U+FB01>rst comparative study of
these three urban form utilizations and how they affect model
interpretation. While several Anglophone studies have been
published (e.g., Kerr et al., 2006; McMillan, 2007; Noland,
Park, Von Hagen, & Chatman, 2014; Oliver et al., 2014; Mitra,
Papaioannou, & Habib, 2016; Woldeamanuel, 2016), European
studies (e.g., M€   uller et al., 2008; Broberg & Sarjala, 2015;
Kaplan et al., 2016) are underrepresented (Lu et al., 2014). We
focused on the Netherlands, a country that is highly attuned to
walking and cycling (Pucher & Buehler, 2008). Although there
have been a few Dutch studies (e.g., Aarts et al., 2013; Kemperman 
& Timmermans, 2014; Van Kann et al., 2015), exposures
along travel routes were disregarded. Therefore, our objectives
were:
(1) to determine the urban form correlates along children’s
school commuting routes affecting walking, cycling, and
being chauffeured, separately; and
(2) to address the methodological issue of how to integrate
urban design variables (i.e., as main effects, composite
measures, or latent variables) in transport mode choice
models for children’s school commuting.
Our <U+FB01>rst hypothesis was that differences in urban form
correlates beyond active versus passive modes are present. An
understanding of which, and how, environmental correlates
affect each individual mode differently is essential for more target-oriented 
and effective urban planning policies and physical-activity-based 
interventions. We assumed, secondly, that
different operationalizations of urban form might not yield
consistent results. Since previous studies were limited to only
one approach, this would explain contradictory <U+FB01>ndings and
have implications for future research.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We <U+FB01>rst introduce 
the study area and data, and then present the empirical

results. Following that, we discuss the key <U+FB01>ndings and how
they translate into policy.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Study design

The study sample comprised 97 children aged 6–11 years of six
elementary schools in <U+FB01>ve cities distributed across the Netherlands 
(Figure 1). To minimize sociodemographic differences
between the schools, schools were selected from neighborhoods
that have a similar pro<U+FB01>le, although they do vary in size and
population density. Each child was GPS-tracked for one regular
school week between December 2008 and April 2009. Due to
the mild climate and the cycling culture, a bias toward nonactive 
commuting can be neglected. The GPS devices (Travel

recorder X, BT-Q1000X, QStarz International Co) were set up
with a location sampling interval of 5 s (Kerr et al., 2011). The
device was attached to an elasticated belt around the hip of
each child from the morning till bedtime. For details about the
study design, we referred to De Vries et al. (2010). Parents gave
written consent before study inclusion. The study received
approval from the Ethics Committee of the Leiden University
Medical Center.

2.2 Data

2.2.1 Transport and individual and data
The raw GPS data were preprocessed in two steps. First, we
applied a trip detection algorithm that separates static activity
locations from trips between the residential and school location
by looping chronologically through the GPS point sequence
(Sterkenburg, Pierik, & De Vries, 2012). In total, 623 trips from
home to school and from school to home were detected. Trips
with other destinations were excluded. Second, once all school

trips had been determined, a set of decision rules and modespeci<U+FB01>c 
threshold values for speed1 were utilized for travel
mode classi<U+FB01>cation (Maas, Sterkenburg, de Vries, & Pierik,
2013). Of the modes, 90% were correctly classi<U+FB01>ed (Sterkenburg
et al., 2012), distinguishing between walking, cycling, and being
chauffeured. Mode choice served as response in subsequent
regressions. Public transport was disregarded, as it is an
uncommon travel mode among this age cohort in the Netherlands. 
In-depth descriptions of GPS processing can be found
elsewhere (Sterkenburg et al., 2012).
A questionnaire completed by the parents or guardians of
each participating child provided personal information (e.g., age,
gender). Body height and weight were collected to derive a sex-
and age-speci<U+FB01>c body mass index (BMI), which was recoded to a
dummy variable referring to normal weight or overweight/obesity. 
Personal data were attached to the GPS tracks.

2.2.2 Urban form and traf<U+FB01>c safety exposures

Both the urban form and the traf<U+FB01>c safety exposures were represented 
through a grid structure. Each city was overlaid with a
regular grid with a cell resolution of 100 m. Comparisons with
the actual urban morphology showed that this size was appropriate 
(e.g., retaining building blocks, squares). Because we doubted
the relevance of exposures that are far apart, we limited the spatial 
context to the immediate traversed surrounding. In order to
represent urban form exposures en route, GIS-based buffers with
a width of 100 m on either side of the GPS trips were computed.
Other GPS studies have used comparable buffer sizes (Badland
et al., 2008). Furthermore, the in<U+FB02>uence of each cell was
weighted according to its overlap with the buffers (e.g., a 50%

overlap resulted in a 50% down-weighing) before the averaged
exposures per variable and per trip were determined.
Guided by Brownson et al. (2009) and Wong et al. (2011),
the following objectively measured urban form indices were
considered. Connectivity was derived fourfold based on the
street topology: the ratio between the number of cul-de-sacs, 3-
way, 4-way, and >4-way intersections relative to all intersections 
within a cell (Schlossberg et al., 2006). Street density is
represented by the total street length per cell (Panter et al.,
2010). Local accessibility is the key for walking and cycling. In
congruence with Helbich et al. (2016), two space-syntax-based
measures were employed, namely the closeness and the
betweenness indices (Cooper, 2015). While the former represents 
how dif<U+FB01>cult it is to reach all other locations j from a
given location i, the latter refers to the business of a street segment 
utilizing the shortest path to go from location i to all
other network locations j. Diversity is central for urban design
and considered as a Shannon entropy index for land-use and
building usage (Broberg & Sarjala, 2015). Land-use data stem
from the Landelijk Grondgebruiksbestand Nederland 6 (LGN;
Hazeu, Schuiling, Van Dorland, Oldengarm, & Gijsbertse,
2010) for the year 2007/08, while the building usage data were
extracted from the cadastre (Basisregistratie Adressen en
Gebouwen; BAG, 2013). Lastly, the vertical shape of the urban
form was depicted through the building roughness, namely
height differences between adjacent buildings (Helbich et al.,
2016). This index is based on a surface model derived from
Dutch laser scanning data (Waterschapshuis, 2008).
Traf<U+FB01>c safety is an equally important determinant of
mode choice (Wong et al., 2011). Three proxy variables
were derived. A dummy variable indicated whether a cell
intersects with a major road as indicated by Navteq street
data. We controlled for the cycle path lengths relative to
the total street length within a cell (Pont et al., 2009). Cycle
path data were obtained from OpenStreetMap (Jokar et al.,
2015). Because sidewalks are omnipresent, they were
excluded. Finally, awareness of fatal and nonfatal traf<U+FB01>c
accidents is a barrier to walking and cycling (Panter et al.,
2010). Cell-wise accident risk employing 2009 data on traf<U+FB01>c 
accidents provided by the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure 
and the Environment was calculated by means of
a kernel density estimation (i.e., higher values refer to a
higher risk). Traf<U+FB01>c volume data were not available.

2.3 Methods

2.3.1 Statistical modeling

Descriptive statistics summarize the data. Non-parametric
Kruskal–Wallis tests were used for continuous variables, and
Fisher tests were used for categorical variables to investigate
differences across the transport modes statistically. Spearman’s
correlation coef<U+FB01>cients were used to test the associations among
the urban form variables.

To test the associations between children’s transport mode
choice (i.e., walking, cycling, being chauffeured) and the covariates, 
we estimated multinomial logit regression models (Belitz
et al., 2015). The models were set up as structured additive
regressions with two random effects and <U+FB01>tted through
restricted maximum likelihood (Umlauf, Adler, Kneib, Lang, &

Zeileis, 2015). The <U+FB01>rst random effect was needed because individual 
trips were repeatedly taken by the same child, while the
second one was required because the children were nested
within cities. Neglecting such correlations challenges the validity 
of statistical inference (Gelman & Hill, 2007). In all models,
being chauffeured served as baseline (reference group).
To obtain information about individual effects, univariate
models were <U+FB01>tted <U+FB01>rst. Variables signi<U+FB01>cant at the p < 0.1 level
were used to develop multivariate models. In total, <U+FB01>ve multivariate 
models were estimated. While the base model is without
urban form variables, models 2–5 include urban form differently 
(e.g., as main effect, PCs, composite measure). The models’ 
goodness-of-<U+FB01>ts were compared with the Akaike
information criterion (AIC), and a suitable random-effects
structure was determined. The lower the AIC score, the better
the model <U+FB01>ts.

2.3.2 Principal component analysis and composite measure
Modeling urban form variables as main effects makes interpretation 
easier, but correlations arising among these covariates
make individual effects hardly assignable and challenges statistical 
inference (Noland et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2014). To overcome 
this, either PCA (Jolliffe, 2002) can be performed or an
index can be constructed.
PCA transforms the original urban form variables into latent
ones depicting the overall data variability through a linear combination 
of the (scaled) variables represented by a few, uncorrelated 
PCs. The <U+FB01>rst PC accounts for most of the variability in
the data, while the succeeding PCs capture the remaining but
declining variability. As PCA extracts an equal number of PCs
as available input variables, the determination of a suitable
number of PCs is crucial (Jolliffe, 2002). Screeplots in combination
with the Kaiser criterion are useful. The former plots the
number of components against the eigenvalues, and the
“elbow” refers to an appropriate number of PCs, while the latter
signi<U+FB01>es PCs with eigenvalues greater than 1 as suitable. To ease
the PCA interpretation, the bi-plot is supportive (Jolliffe, 2002).
The loadings (i.e., arrows) show the direction of each PC,
expressing the associations to the original variables, whereas
the scores are the new data points projected on the new coordinates 
for each PC. Once identi<U+FB01>ed, these PCs enter the mode
choice models.
Alternatively, Frank et al. (2006, 2010) proposed a composite 
measure of urban form. This index is based on intersection
density, land-use diversity, etc. and sums the z-scores of the

involved variables. Despite several construction possibilities
(Kerr et al., 2006; Clark, Scott, & Yiannakoulias, 2014), a comparison 
by Manaugh and El-Geneidy (2011) showed only
minor differences for travel behavior modeling, highlighting
their good performance in summarizing the dimensions of
urban design.


3. Results

Of the trips, 64% were done on foot, 27% by bike, and 9% by
automobile. Key descriptive statistics for each variable strati<U+FB01>ed
by transport mode are shown in Table 1. With p < 0.001, both
the Kruskal–Wallis and the Fisher tests refer to signi<U+FB01>cant differences 
across the modes for several variables, including age,

gender, and trip distance, and several urban form variables. For
example, the median age at which younger children are more
prone to be chauffeured than older ones varies. A motorized
mode is more frequently used for longer travel distances compared 
to walking and cycling. Some of the correlations among
the urban form covariates are critical. For example, the roughness 
and closeness indices are, with a value of 0.720
(p < 0.001), rather strongly associated.
To analyze individual associations between mode choice and
the covariates, univariate models were estimated. AIC scores
consistently refer to better model performances using a personbased 
and a city-based random effect, instead of employing
only a person-based random effect. Summary statistics of these
univariate models are given in Table 2. Insigni<U+FB01>cant variables
with p > 0.1 (i.e., BMI, trip direction, bike path, accident risk,
cul-de-sac, 4-way crossings, building diversity) were removed
from subsequent analyses.
The signi<U+FB01>cant urban form variables of the univariate models 
were then used to derive the composite measure and to conduct 
PCA. The <U+FB01>rst quantile of the composite index is ¡5.639
and the third is 5.138, with a mean of around 0 (S.D. D 7). The
Kaiser criterion (eigenvalues >1) shown in Figure 2 (left panel)
suggests that the <U+FB01>rst three PCs explain in total approximately
80% of the total variance (PC1: 33%, PC2: 32%, PC3: 15%).
Collinearity is no longer present among the PCs. The bi-plot
(Figure 2, right panel) shows both grouping effects of the variables 
and similar loadings. PC1 is mainly characterized by negative 
loadings, while PC2 shows a balance between negative and
positive loadings. PC1 shows the tendency to encompass connectivity, 
density, and diversity variables, while PC2 comprises
rather more accessibility variables. Still, the interpretation
remains demanding. Several urban form input variables are
highly correlated, as indicated by the angle between two arrows
(e.g., the closeness and building roughness indices).
Table 3 shows the estimation results of the <U+FB01>ve multivariate
models equipped with two random effects, as suggested by the
AIC. With an AIC score of 771, the PCA-based model 4 has the
best <U+FB01>t, followed by model 2 (DAIC D 4.4) and model 3 (DAIC D
7.4), while model 5 with the composite measure performs poorly
and is only slightly better (DAIC D 5.8) than the base model.
Even the input variables are signi<U+FB01>cant in the univariate
models, whereas gender and major roads turned out to be insigni<U+FB01>cant 
in the multivariate base model. Age is signi<U+FB01>cantly positively 
related to walking (b D 0.441, p < 0.010) and only
weakly to cycling (b D 0.394, p < 0.100). Trip distance has a
negative effect on walking (b D ¡0.694, p < 0.001) and cycling

(b D ¡0.905, p < 0.001) relative to the automobile. In the best
performing model (4), age remains a weakly signi<U+FB01>cant covariate 
for walking (b D 0.321, p < 0.010) but not for cycling. This
contrasts with model 5, which incorporates the composite

urban form index, where age is signi<U+FB01>cantly positively associated 
with both walking and cycling. No signi<U+FB01>cant effect of
major roads emerged in models 4 and 5. After extending the
base model with latent urban form variables (i.e., PC1-3), it
turns out that distance is no longer a discriminating factor for
mode choice. Moreover, in model 4, PC1 and PC2 are signi<U+FB01>cantly 
related to mode choice, though not PC3. However,
distance remains strongly signi<U+FB01>cant (bwalking D ¡0.635, p <
0.002; bcycling D ¡0.882, p < 0.001) when the composite index
is applied (model 5). In both model 4 and model 5, the challenge 
concerning the interpretation of the urban form associations 
persists. Thus, model 2 considers urban forms as an
individual variable. Age is positively related to mode choice
(bwalking D 0.520, p < 0.005; bcycling D 0.391, p < 0.093), while
gender is related only to a minor extent to walking (b D
¡0.881, p < 0.091). Like in model 4, distance is not signi<U+FB01>cant,
and the univariate effect of main roads disappears. For walking
only, 3-way intersections (b D ¡0.094, p < 0.064), >4-way
intersections (b D ¡0.586, p < 0.023), and land-use diversity
(b D ¡11.970, p < 0.021) show a negative association. Furthermore, 
the two accessibility measures are statistically signi<U+FB01>cant.
While closeness index shows a consistent negative association
with walking (b D ¡0.102, p < 0.034) and cycling (b D
¡0.102, p < 0.071), the betweenness index indicates a positive
relationship for walking (b D 0.183, p < 0.001) and cycling
(b D 0.128, p < 0.070). Despite being signi<U+FB01>cant in the
univariate models, neither building roughness nor street
density shows any signi<U+FB01>cance in the multivariate model.

4. Discussions

In the present study, we examined how urban form correlates
are related to children’s commuting mode choice. By utilizing
GPS tracking, modeling associations for transport modes separately, 
and comparing how different urban form operationalizations 
(i.e., individual variables, composite measures, latent
variables) alter model interpretation, we have contributed to
the existing literature.

4.1 Descriptive statistics

Our descriptive statistics showed a large share of walking and
cycling, whereas in North America and Australia, chauffeuring
is pervasive (Carver et al., 2013). In the Netherlands, active
commuting (64% walking and 27% cycling trips; total 91%) is
more prevalent than that in, for example, Norway (75%)
(Børrestad, Andersen, & Bere, 2011) or Belgium (59%) (D’Haese, 
De Meester, De Bourdeaudhuij, Deforche, & Cardon,
2011). Our total percentage of active commuting trips than that
reported for the hilly Limburg area of the Netherlands (64%)
(Van Kann et al., 2015). That the Netherlands has an overwhelming 
share of active travelers is not surprising, considering
that the population is highly disposed toward walking and
cycling, the country has a mild climate and a high-standard
walking and cycling infrastructure, and school are physically

well-integrated in neighborhoods (Pucher & Buehler, 2008;
Helbich, B€ocker, & Dijst, 2014).

4.2 Principal <U+FB01>ndings concerning the individual effects

Model 2 showed that a limited number of variables are associated 
with children’s mode choice, con<U+FB01>rming the results of
Oliver et al. (2014). Concerning children’s individual characteristics, 
a persistent <U+FB01>nding across the models was that age is positively 
related to walking and cycling, with a distinct effect for
the former. This con<U+FB01>rms the <U+FB01>ndings of Aarts et al. (2013) as
well as Goeverden and De Boer (2013) that older children are
more likely to walk or cycle. This behavior can be explained
through improved cognitive capabilities, which result in more
independent mobility (Mitra, 2013). The literature is inconclusive 
about gender effects on mode choice (Faulkner et al.,
2009). Although univariate models indicated that mode choice
varies across sex, analogous to Larsen et al. (2009), no evidence
was found in multivariate models. While supporting Van Goeverden 
and De Boer (2013) for the Netherlands and McDonald
(2008) for the United States that gender is not signi<U+FB01>cantly
related to walking, this result contradicts the position of
Børrestad et al. (2011), who showed that Norwegian girls are
more likely to walk and less likely to cycle compared to boys.
In the base model, the trip distance stands out. Without
adjusting for urban form, distance is, as expected, a strong discriminating 
factor, as is the case in the literature (Bringolf-Isler
et al., 2008; M€ uller et al., 2008; Larsen, Gilliland, & Hess, 2012;
Kemperman & Timmermans, 2014). This is intuitive, since longer 
distances require pronounced physical effort, which makes
walking and cycling less attractive (Aarts et al., 2013; Panter,
Corder, Grif<U+FB01>n, Jones, & Van Sluijs, 2013). However, this conclusion 
must be reversed when the model is adjusted for urban
form, modeling the variables either directly or through PCs. It

seems that distance-related effects get absorbed by the built
environment (Helbich et al., 2016). This does not occur when
the composite measure is considered instead. It could be speculated 
that the index represents urban form less holistically compared 
to the PCs, as evidenced by the weaker model
performance. Or perhaps the importance of the involved variables 
is not re<U+FB02>ected appropriately (e.g., Frank et al. (2010)
weighed the involved variables differently). As reviewed by
Pont et al. (2009), others also report insigni<U+FB01>cant distance
effects. Trip direction appeared insigni<U+FB01>cant, which con<U+FB01>rms

the suggestion by Larsen et al. (2009) that travel decisions are
usually made for the entire day.
As for transport safety and urban form correlates, only a few
were associated with mode choice, as Panter et al. (2013) found
in their study in Norfolk (United Kingdom). Neither walking
nor cycling was signi<U+FB01>cantly related to traf<U+FB01>c safety, as also
found by Schlossberg et al. (2006). This contradicts Van Kann
et al. (2015), who reported that traf<U+FB01>c safety (e.g., cycling infrastructure, 
crossing major roads) is a major issue for walking
and cycling, but supports Ewing et al. (2004) and Aart et al.
(2013), who showed that bike paths are insigni<U+FB01>cant. However,
these results infer not that traf<U+FB01>c safety is irrelevant, but that in
the Netherlands traf<U+FB01>c hazards have been minimized by nearly
omnipresent sidewalks, bike lanes, etc. Or perhaps that the
environment as perceived by the parents represents safety


issues more realistically than the utilized GIS measures (Mitra,
Faulkner, Buliung, & Stone, 2014).
Whereas functional building usage seems irrelevant for
mode choice, the opposite is true for land-use diversity where
lower index scores only foster walking. Although several studies
found null associations (Wong et al., 2011), we found a signi<U+FB01>cantly 
negative association for walking. This could be because
the schools in our study are not located in inner cities, which
have pronounced land-use diversity. Aarts et al. (2013) argued
that building height differences might encourage active modes,
but we are not able to support this hypothesis.
In keeping with previous studies (Schlossberg et al., 2006;
Panter et al., 2010; Larsen et al., 2012), street connectivity seems
essential. Model 2 suggests that 3-way and >4-way intersections 
are inversely and signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with walking but
not with cycling. This means, for example, that better-connected 
street networks (i.e., >4-way intersections) decrease
walking relative to the automobile. At the <U+FB01>rst glance, this relationship 
appears counterintuitive, but well-connected streets
also increase the risk of traf<U+FB01>c accidents due to crossings.
Wong et al. (2011) also found that other intersection (e.g., cul-de-sac) 
variables are insigni<U+FB01>cant. Cross-comparisons with
other study sites are not feasible for the space-syntax-based
accessibility measures because these have not previously been
considered. For walking and cycling, the closeness shows a negative 
association, meaning that a less-accessible street network
reduces the likelihood for both active modes relative to the
automobile usage. A reverse interpretation applies to the
betweenness index, where well-accessible streets promote walking 
and cycling (Helbich et al., 2016). These results are rational,
since in the Netherlands accessibility is a major locational factor 
in selecting a primary school (Herweijer & Vogels, 2004).

4.3 Principal <U+FB01>ndings concerning urban form

operationalizations

Although intuitive to do, entering the urban form correlates as
main effects might create multicollinearity problems (Broberg
et al., 2013; Noland et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2014). However, PCA
and composite measures present a way to overcome this challenge 
(Manaugh & El-Geneidy, 2011; Clark et al., 2014).
While reducing collinearity, both PCA and composite
measures impede the direct interpretation of how environmental 
variables are associated with transport behavior. The
former is also challenged by the selection of a suitable number
of PCs, even though several criteria (e.g., the Kaiser criterion)
alleviate this decision (Jolliffe, 2002). These criteria usually
suggest more than only the <U+FB01>rst PC (e.g., Broberg et al., 2013
extracted <U+FB01>ve PCs). For both PCA and composite measures,
it remains unclear how each individual factor is related to
children’s mode choice (Noland et al., 2014). However, such
knowledge might be crucial to implement environment-based
interventions and set up policies that promote physical activity. 
To make it easier to gain an in-depth understanding of
how the derived latent variables are formed, we suggest using
visualization tools such as the bi-plot. Although Clark et al.
(2014) argued for the simplicity of composite measures, the
risk that positive and negative values might counteract each
other remains.

As shown, an inappropriate number of PCs deteriorate the
goodness-of-<U+FB01>t (model 3 vs. model 5), which calls for careful
selection. Comparing different composite measures, Manaugh
and El-Geneidy (2011) ascribe them, in general, a good performance 
in explaining travel behavior. Our results show otherwise, 
as indicated by the model performances. A worse AIC
score is achieved by model 5 compared to model 4. This might
be interpreted as meaning that the composite measure does not
effectively represent the entire complexity of urban form better
than the representation based on statistical dimension reducing
techniques (Broberg et al., 2013). Because the “true” associations 
are unknown, we cannot recommend one speci<U+FB01>c method
as the gold standard but, based on our <U+FB01>ndings, we lean toward
PCA.

4.4 Strengths and limitations

The present study contributes to the limited number of GPS-
based case studies on school commuting. En route urban form
exposures represent the environmental context more realistically 
than Euclidean distances or shortest path analyses, assuming 
that children optimize their routes (Harrison et al., 2014).
Besides, the route recall bias introduced by self-administered
travel diaries is eliminated. Whereas the majority of studies
look at walking and cycling as a single category (Bringolf-Isler
et al., 2008; Larson et al., 2009; Broberg et al., 2013), we estimated 
urban form associations separately for individual transport 
modes. Another key strength is that urban form variables
were operationalized on a spatial micro level, considering the
local morphology on both the horizontal and the vertical level.
This extension toward the third dimension is unique, as is the
application of space-syntax-based urban form indicators.
Because the Netherlands was the study area, this investigation
advances the literature speci<U+FB01>cally targeting a walking- and

cycling-oriented country (Van Goeverden & de Boer, 2013),

which complements the automobile-oriented North America-centric 
body of knowledge (Pont et al., 2009). Finally, the present 
research was the <U+FB01>rst to compare different urban form
operationalizations.
Although it breaks new ground, this study has limitations.
Though useful for hypotheses generation, the research design is
cross-sectional (Lu et al., 2014; Fishman et al., 2015). We recommend 
that future studies be longitudinal and consider
changes of the covariates over time (Mitra et al., 2016). Parent’s
attitudes toward their residential location choice were not available 
and self-selection cannot be ruled out (Mokhtarian & Cao,
2008). Yet, carefully following Badland et al. (2008) and Wong
et al. (2011), we cannot obviate an ideal context representation,
calling for sensitivity studies. We focused on school commuting
trips, but Kemperman and Timmermans (2014) showed that
other trip purposes are affected differently by urban form. The
sampling was restricted to children living in the school neighborhood. 
Even though long commuting distances are uncommon 
for this age group, it might have an in<U+FB02>uence on mode
choices, especially public transport. Although the in<U+FB02>uence of
socioeconomics on the household level (e.g., income, automobile 
ownership) is inconclusive (McDonald, 2008; Van Goeverden & 
de Boer, 2013), our models remained unadjusted due to
missing data and did not acknowledge interdependence among

transport mode alternatives (Ermagun & Levinson, 2017).
Lastly, our dataset solely relied on objective indicators,
although there is no doubt that parental perceptions in<U+FB02>uence
children’s mobility (Yeung et al., 2008; Mitra, 2013). It would
be informative to enrich our data in that respect, and to consider 
neighborhood cohesion, stranger danger, etc. (Chillon
et al., 2014).

4.5 Implications for research and policy

The results are valuable for both academia and policymakers.
We suggest that conclusions drawn from mode choice models
depend on how urban form correlates are integrated. Although
Adams et al. (2014) introduced common ground to derive such
measures, integrating these indices in statistical models remains
a challenge. Careful attention must be paid to correlations
among urban form proxy variables, and thorough screening for
multicollinearity among variables is recommended. We
encourage researchers to go beyond only one representation,
since <U+FB01>ndings might change with changes in urban form operationalization. 
The number of PCs should be based on one of
the well-established criteria to avoid oversimpli<U+FB01>cation and to
have suf<U+FB01>cient data-inherent information. The research community 
should also recognize the availability of models that are
robust against multicollinearity (e.g., elastic net; Zou & Hastie,
2005) and start to use them (Helbich et al., 2016).
Most policies are broadly designed to increase active school
commuting, and they combine walking and cycling into a single
category. Such “one-<U+FB01>ts-all” policies may be inef<U+FB01>cient, or interventions 
may fail. The present research will help planning authorities 
and public health strategists to understand the complex way in
which urban environmental correlates in<U+FB02>uence transport behavior.
Our <U+FB01>ndings call for interventions that are targeted at either
walking or cycling, rather than both: Only interventions developed
for a speci<U+FB01>c transport mode will yield signi<U+FB01>cant and population-wide 
health bene<U+FB01>ts.

5. Conclusions

This analysis evidences not only that urban form correlates
along the commuting routes vary across children’s transport
modes, but also that the magnitudes of the estimated coef<U+FB01>cients 
differ in size. To optimize the effectiveness of planning
and health interventions, it is key for policymakers to develop
mode-speci<U+FB01>c actions dedicated to either walking or cycling,
and not both. Secondly, not only were inconsistent results
found for different urban form representations, but also the
associations among the children’s personal characteristics and
trip distance changed. As the models’ goodness-of-<U+FB01>ts indicate
distinct differences across urban form operationalizations, a
well-selected number of PCs, rather than an urban form composite 
measure, should be used. Sensitivity analyses are thus
recommended.
