Impact of weather conditions on middle school students’ commute
mode choices: Empirical <U+FB01>ndings from Beijing, ChinaABSTRACT
Weather conditions have been recognized as important factors a<U+FB00>ecting school commute mode
choices. This paper aims to explore the modal shift of middle school commutes with respect to the
variation in weather-related variables, with empirical emphases on the situation in Beijing,
China. Data from the latest Beijing School Commute Survey (2014–2015) were adopted, and
multinomial probit (MNP) and multinomial logit (MNL) models were developed. The modeling
results are in favor of the MNP model because it has better statistical performance. Weather-related variables, including sky condition, wind speed, highest temperature, humidity, air qualityindex (AQI), and some interaction terms, were found to have a signi<U+FB01>cant impact on students'commute mode choices. Based on these models, an empirical sensitivity measure was de<U+FB01>ned asthe expected percentage change in the probability of choosing each mode with respect to anorder of magnitude change in the in<U+FB02>uential factors. Most of the results are in line with those ofprevious studies, and some unique results re<U+FB02>ect features of Beijing. For example, on days withextremely poor air quality, students are more likely to turn to public transport rather than use acar from active transportation modes. This is probably due to the special urban tra<U+FB03>c regulationsthat restrict household car ownership and car travel in Beijing. These <U+FB01>ndings could have implications for promoting active transportation for students and serve as references for policymakers and planners.
1. Introduction
     School commutes are integral to urban daily commutes and have an important in<U+FB02>uence on local tra<U+FB03>c conditions (Black et al.,
2001), vehicle emissions (Singleton, 2014), travel behaviors of adults who escort students (Scheiner, 2016; He and Giuliano, 2017),
and the physical health of students (Sirard and Slater, 2008; Hellinga, 2016). Understanding travel behaviors, especially school
commute mode choices, has received considerable attention over the past two decades. Studies have investigated impacts on school
commute mode choices based on the e<U+FB00>ects of socioeconomic and demographic variables (Kerr et al., 2007; Wati and Tranter, 2015),
urban environment conditions (Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014), land use characteristics (Scheiner, 2016), etc. However, the
impact of weather conditions has been rarely examined (Scheiner, 2016). Although some studies (Hellinga, 2016) have indicated the
importance of weather conditions on determining student commute modes, there remains a lack of studies speci<U+FB01>cally focusing on
quantitative mode choice behaviors, and most of the existing literature re<U+FB02>ects weather conditions using only seasonal or weekly
variations (Scheiner, 2016).
    Nevertheless, the in<U+FB02>uence of weather conditions on behaviors for general travel purposes has been studied for several decades.
For example, it has been shown that inclement weather, such as rain, snow, fog, cold, and high winds, impact tra<U+FB03>c safety, roadway
capacity (Maze, et al., 2006), and travel route choices (Khattak and de Palma, 1997; Böcker et al., 2013). In particular, longer travel
times for a car trip are required with heavier rain or snow due to reduced travel speeds (Tsapakis et al., 2013).
    Thus, it seems plausible that school commute mode choices should also be a<U+FB00>ected by weather conditions. For example, sunny
weather encourages students to walk and ride bicycles (Kamargianni et al., 2015), while students opt to take a bus or car to avoid
walking on rainy days even when the distance to school is suitable for cycling or walking (Müller et al., 2008). Understanding the
relationship between weather conditions and school commute characteristics will help policymakers implement appropriate management strategies and create more e<U+FB03>cient and viable policies.
    In short, the existing literature analyzing the e<U+FB00>ect of weather conditions on school commute mode choices is limited. There are
few studies that have examined di<U+FB00>erent countries, including Norway (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009), Germany (Müller et al., 2008), the
United States (Sirard et al., 2005; Schlossberg et al., 2006), Canada (Mitra and Faulkner, 2012), the Netherlands (Hellinga, 2016),
and Australia (Nankervis, 1999). However, these studies have primarily focused on North American and Western European countries
rather than developing countries. Studies have also suggested that the empirical results of school commute models are likely to vary
across di<U+FB00>erent regions (Sirard and Slater, 2008; Liu et al., 2015b). Therefore, this study seeks to present an econometrical analysis
focusing speci<U+FB01>cally on the impact of weather conditions on school commute mode choices using the latest school commute survey
data for Beijing and to provide references for similar cities in China and other countries.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 positions the paper in the context of past literature. In Section 3, we
describe the adopted dataset and present descriptive results of the included variables. Section 4 presents the econometrical models
used for analyses. In Sections 5 and 6, we summarize our key <U+FB01>ndings. Section 7 concludes the paper and discusses its limitations and
directions for future research.
2. Literature review
    Previous studies (e.g., Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008; He and Giuliano, 2017) have usually de<U+FB01>ned travel modes for school
commutes as including walking, bicycle, taking public transport, and car. One of the major concerns in studying the behaviors of
travel mode choices for school commutes is to understand factors a<U+FB00>ecting the active (walk and bicycle) travel modes (Martin et al.,
2014), which have been considered a key source of physical activity for adolescents, especially in the present era of excessive screen-watching activities (Lauricella et al., 2015). Walking or cycling to school becomes important opportunities for adolescents to enjoy
rigorous physical exercise. It has been widely recognized that active commuting is positively associated with psychological well-being
(Martin et al., 2014; Chan and Ryan, 2009) and has been proposed as a strategy for reducing the prevalence of obesity and related
diseases (Sirard et al., 2005) as well as enhancing the independence of children (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009).
    Many factors have been investigated to examine their in<U+FB02>uence on school commute mode decisions, including the age, gender,
and ethnicity of the student (Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014; Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Hellinga, 2016), household car ownership
(Larsen et al., 2009; Pojani and Boussauw, 2014; Schlossberg et al., 2006), land-use mix (Ewing et al., 2004; Kerr et al., 2007; Larsen
et al., 2009), school size (Ewing et al., 2004), travel distance/time (Ewing et al., 2004; Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Müller et al., 2008),
mother’s working hours (Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014; He and Giuliano, 2017), number of children in the household (Hellinga,
2016), and family income (Schlossberg et al., 2006).
    Some of these factors exhibit consistent in<U+FB02>uential patterns across almost all studies. For example, travel distance has been shown
to have a signi<U+FB01>cant impact on school commute mode choices; shorter distances promote the use of an active commuting mode
(Ewing et al., 2004; Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014; Hellinga, 2016; He and Giuliano, 2017). However, some results have been
inconsistent across studies due to discrepancies in the overall settings of variables and models, variable categorizations, sample sizes,
and possibly unobserved heterogeneities relating to variations in student cohorts, regions, cultures, and religions (Singh and
Vasudevan, 2018). For example, studies (e.g., Sidharthan et al., 2011) have found that an increase in age could result in higher odds
of walking and bicycling for school commutes, although some studies (Wilson et al., 2010) have been unable to detect a well-de<U+FB01>ned
relationship between age and school commute mode choices. Readers should consult a few studies (Pojani and Boussauw, 2014;
Hellinga, 2016; Scheiner, 2016; Singh and Vasudevan, 2018; Li and Zhao, 2015; Cheng et al., 2017) for a more extensive and
comprehensive review of the factors a<U+FB00>ecting school commute mode choices. In contrast to weather-related variables, these factors
have been well studied.
    For general purposes, the impact of weather conditions has been investigated in terms of public transit ridership (Arana et al.,
2014; Singhal et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2007), pedestrian volume (Aultman-Hall et al. 2009), trip-purpose variation (Cools et al., 2010),
departure time (De Palma and Rochat, 1999), and route choice (Khattak and de Palma, 1997). Days with adverse weather conditions,
such as rain, wind, and low temperatures, are generally more likely to reduce propensities for using public transit, walking, and
bicycling and correspondingly raise the use of passenger cars (Clark et al., 2014). Using regression models, quantitative results have
also been presented in the literature. For example, younger travels have been found to be more sensitive to low temperatures than
older age groups, and cyclists are more sensitive to precipitation, low temperatures, and wind than walkers (Flynn et al., 2012;
Saneinejad et al., 2012).
    These results and conclusions provide important references for understanding the weather’s impact on school commute behaviors,
but school commutes have distinct features. Speci<U+FB01>cally, a regular trip could be canceled (Madre et al., 2007) due to poor weather
conditions, leading to reduced overall demand (Aultman-Hall et al. 2009; Liu et al., 2015a; Bergström and Magnusson, 2003).
However, the overall demand for school commutes is by nature less sensitive to weather conditions. Moreover, adverse weather
conditions are associated with a higher rate of tra<U+FB03>c accidents (Koetse and Rietveld, 2009; Changnon, 1996; Edwards, 1999; Yu
et al., 2015), raising safety concerns for parents making decisions on children’s school commute modes.
    As mentioned above, the existing literature examining the relationship between weather conditions and school commuting behaviors is limited except for a few studies that consider weather-related variables in modeling school commute mode choices,
including seasonal variations (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Müller et al., 2008), temperature characteristics (Sirard et al., 2005),
precipitation (Mitra and Faulkner, 2012), and wind speed (Hellinga, 2016). Similar to a regular trip, poor weather has also been
identi<U+FB01>ed as a primary reason for using passenger cars (Schlossberg et al., 2006), while some studies (Nankervis, 1999; Mitra and
Faulkner, 2012) have reported that weather conditions are not strong barriers for students in choosing an active mode for school
commutes. Thus, the in<U+FB02>uence of weather conditions on school commute behaviors is not <U+FB01>xed and may depend on di<U+FB00>erences in
regions, student cohorts, and other variables.
    Student travel behaviors have begun to raise concerns in Beijing because they are directly related to physical activities and health
conditions of adolescents, to road tra<U+FB03>c performance, and to transportation planning and policies. Furthermore, Beijing has its own
urban features and weather characteristics, e.g., poor air quality, and these can lead to special in<U+FB02>uential patterns between weather
conditions and school commute mode choices. The fact that these characteristics of Beijing have not been considered in previous
studies motivated the present study.
    As one of China’s megacities, Beijing’s air quality is sometimes very poor (Li et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017) due to
excessive emissions from vehicles and neighboring industries, especially in winter. This study incorporates the air quality index (AQI)
as an in<U+FB02>uential factor in the models of school commute mode choices. To our knowledge, this is the <U+FB01>rst time the AQI has been
considered in travel demand models.
    Although the weather’s impact on travel mode choices has been considered in research covering over three decades, studies
speci<U+FB01>cally focusing on school commutes are limited. This study contributes to the literature by providing an empirical analysis of the
weather’s impact on school commute mode choices using a recent large-scale survey in Beijing, China.
3. Data
3.1. Study area and the data source
    Beijing is the capital city of China, with a population of more than 27 million. Based on the latest education census, the city has a
school-going population of 1.8 million, creating approximately 1.0 million car-based person commutes every day. Although these car-based school commutes only account for approximately 10% of all car trips, urban tra<U+FB03>c conditions are very sensitive to these
commutes because the overall tra<U+FB03>c pressure is high. In addition, because these school commutes are temporally and spatially
concentrated, they could lead to serious tra<U+FB03>c jams on roads near schools and create bottlenecks throughout the overall network.
    Beijing is implementing two special policies for controlling passenger car demand. First, approximately 80% of private cars are
allowed traveling on the road, with rotations based on the last digit of license plate numbers. Second, the number of newly purchased
private cars is controlled for the entire city. Every person wishing to buy a car must participate in a drawing, and the odds of winning
are very small; hence, some households in Beijing do not own cars. For those households, taxis or ride-sourcing services are always an
option. Thus, it is valid to have cars as an alternative for all the observations. In the survey, private cars, taxis, and ride-sourcing
vehicles are not di<U+FB00>erentiated and are all designated as cars.
    The data adopted in this study originated from the latest Beijing School Commute Survey conducted in December 2014 and
January 2015. The geographic coverage of the dataset is the central area of Beijing, comprising six inner districts. The survey was
conducted using an online questionnaire; the sampled students were required to <U+FB01>ll in a form via an internet website. The online
questionnaire comprised questions about the student’s personal and household attributes and school commute characteristics. For
commute-related questions, the students had to provide information about their latest school commute made prior to the day the
questionnaire was completed.
    The survey collected student and commute characteristics, while weather-related variables were matched from historical weather
records. These weather-related variables corresponded to the departure time of each trip, although they were averaged across the six
inner districts in Beijing. Note that the highest temperature was measured on a daily basis. The original survey covered students in
primary school, middle school, and high school. Middle school students experience a transition period, including a growing independence. Thus, the lower-grade students in middle school might behave similarly to primary school students who require their
parents’ company for their school commute, whereas the upper-grade students have more frequent opportunities to go to school by
themselves. Thus, this study only focuses on middle school commutes, with the <U+FB01>nal dataset comprising 97,427 observations.
3.2. Description of variables
    There are four alternative transportation modes for school commutes, i.e., walking, bicycle, public transport, and car. Speci<U+FB01>cally,
the bicycle mode includes regular bicycles and e-bicycles; the car mode includes private cars, taxis, and ride-sourcing vehicles; and
the public transport mode includes buses, subways, and school buses. In Beijing, very few students take school buses as their daily
travel mode to school.
    Weather conditions in the original data include sky condition, wind speed, highest temperature, lowest temperature, AQI, hu-
midity, and visibility. During the survey period, there were no rainy days. Thus, precipitation was not considered in this study. The
lowest temperature and visibility were also dropped because they had no evident impact on school commute mode choices at the 95%
signi<U+FB01>cance level.
     All adopted continuous and categorical explanatory variables are described in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Fig. 1 illustrates the
variations in weather-related variables during the survey period. Each observation in the data represents a school trip and the
associated information on weather conditions. Table 2 indicates that middle school students preferred public transport as a commuting mode over the other available modes. The proportion of walking to school is 19.0%, which is lower than in some countries.
For example, a study in Australia indicated that 44.3% of female students and 37.4% of male students walk to school (Leslie et al.,
2010). In Toronto in 2006, walking was the choice for 42.5% and 30.7% of school commutes for students 11–13 years old and
14–15 years old, respectively (Buliung et al., 2009). Regarding sky conditions, most observed commutes (73.4%) occurred on days
with good conditions, while 19.9% of commutes occurred on days with poor conditions. Humidity refers to the amount of water
vapor in the air and indicates the likelihood of precipitation, dew, or fog. In this paper, relative humidity was adopted, which
measures the current humidity relative to the maximum humidity at that temperature. AQI is an atmosphere variable of increasing
interest. In practice, people intuitively perceive AQI as “good,” “poor,” and “terrible” corresponding to the ranges “=100,” “ > 100
and =200,” and “ > 200,” respectively.
4. Econometrical models
    The multinomial logit (MNL) model provides a closed form for evaluating the chosen probability, leading to fewer computation
pressures and clearer inferences on explanatory variables. However, the MNL model su<U+FB00>ers from the independence of irrelevant
alternatives (IIA) property due to the assumption of the independently distributed error terms.
    One way of removing this assumption is to consider a multivariate normal distribution for the error terms of the utilities, which
leads to the multinomial probit (MNP) model. For individual i , eij for j = 1,2,…,J follows a multivariate normal distribution with mean
zero and covariance matrix.
    The covariance matrix for the error term di<U+FB00>erences is usually used in model estimation. More generally, with J alternatives, the
number of the identi<U+FB01>able parameters of the covariance matrix is J × (J -1)/2-1, and it is almost impossible to interpret these
parameters. The following analyses were performed with the aid of the “mlogit” package in R.
5. Estimation results from the MNP and MNL models
    The MNP and MNL models were used to test the e<U+FB00>ects of sky condition, wind speed, highest temperature, AQI, humidity,
commute distance, and age of student on school commute mode choices. In addition, we also tested the e<U+FB00>ects of some interaction
terms, and two important interactions (highest temperature plus humidity and AQI plus distance) were found to have signi<U+FB01>cant
impacts. Table 3 reports the estimated coe<U+FB03>cients for both the MNP and MNL models. In this study, the dummy coding was adopted
when specifying these categorical variables (Hensher et al., 2015). The results show that the MNP model is superior to the MNL model
because the former has smaller AIC and BIC values and a larger McFadden R-squared. These characteristics indicate that the MNP
model is able to mine more information from the data than the MNL model.
    In the MNL model, the exponential function of a particular coe<U+FB03>cient of a categorical variable is the odds ratio of the particular
travel mode relative to the reference level between the status and the reference status of this variable. However, the estimated
probability depends on the magnitudes or levels of other variables (Ma et al., 2016). If the corresponding status of the variable (for
the categorical variables) is taken or the magnitude of the variable (for the continuous variables) increases under the MNL specification, the probability of the travel mode with the largest coe<U+FB03>cient will increase, whereas the mode with the smallest coe<U+FB03>cient
will decrease. For example, with an increase in wind speed, the probability of walking decreases (coe<U+FB03>cient of zero because the walk
mode is the reference level), whereas the probability of using a car increases (coe<U+FB03>cient of 0.039 is the largest among the four
modes). However, the direction of probability change of the bicycle and public transport modes cannot be inferred through the
corresponding coe<U+FB03>cients. Note that such a rule is not valid for variables having interaction terms.
    For the MNP model, it is further di<U+FB03>cult to interpret these coe<U+FB03>cients because the estimated probability is evaluated through a
multiple integral involving the coe<U+FB03>cients of all variables. Thus, these coe<U+FB03>cients are more useful in predicting the probability of a
travel mode for a given observation; they do not provide clear and direct indications for an understanding of the behavioral e<U+FB00>ects of
variables. Therefore, this study introduces an empirical sensitivity analysis to overcome this issue, as illustrated in the next section.
6. Sensitivity analyses
6.1. De<U+FB01>nition of empirical sensitivity
    In the MNP and MNL models, the estimated coe<U+FB03>cients cannot re<U+FB02>ect the overall impact of a particular variable directly because
it also depends on the magnitudes of all other variables. Therefore, a “strict impact” for a given variable cannot be determined
because there are many ways of combining one variable with the other variables. One empirical way for handling this issue is to
aggregate the impact of a variable with respect to each observed sample, in which the combinations of variables are inherently
contained. The results are expected to re<U+FB02>ect how the population reacts to hypothetical changes in variables providing a considerable
sample size. For example, a type of elasticity (Eluru et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2016; Cameron and Trivedi, 2009) was de<U+FB01>ned in previous
studies as the expected percentage change of the probability given a one-unit increase in the variable. In this study, empirical
sensitivity was de<U+FB01>ned based on the elasticity with a minor modi<U+FB01>cation. Instead of <U+FB01>xing the change in a variable to be one unit,
empirical sensitivity can be evaluated with respect to the changes in a variable of any amount. Eqs. (5) and (6) provide the formulas
de<U+FB01>ning empirical sensitivity.
6.2. Single-variable sensitivity
    Table 4 reports the empirical sensitivity for each variable according to the MNP and MNL models. These numbers are the
percentage changes in the probability of a travel mode with respect to changes in each variable. Positive values of sensitivity indicate
an increase in the probability, whereas negative values indicate the opposite. The empirical sensitivities in Table 4 exhibit generally
consistent in<U+FB02>uence patterns across the two models with only minor discrepancies in magnitude.
6.2.1. Sky conditions
     According to Table 4, the qualitative impact of sky conditions on school commute mode choices is the same across the MNP and
MNL models and di<U+FB00>ers only slightly in magnitude. With a change in sky conditions from good to fair, the probabilities of walking,
cycling, and taking public transport are expected to decrease by 2.3%, 21.5%, and 2.1%, respectively according to the MNP model.
Moreover, the number of students choosing a car to go to school increases by 18.1%. Such a pattern is in line with previous studies
(e.g., Bergström and Magnusson, 2003) showing that poor weather promotes the use of cars. In fact, the market shares of walking and
using public transport change in very slight amounts, although cycling drops substantially, which accounts for the major proportion
of the students who turn to the car mode. Moreover, when sky conditions continue to change (from fair to poor), the above-discussed
trend takes the opposite direction, where the car mode share decreases. When sky conditions worsen, tra<U+FB03>c may become congested
and visibility is reduced, which raises resistant concerns about using cars.
6.2.2. Wind speed
     Table 4 presents the modal shift results with respect to two di<U+FB00>erent levels of wind speed increments, namely, 1 m/s and 5 m/s.
With an increase in wind speed, walking, cycling, and public transport are less likely to be used, resulting in the increased use of cars.
It is easy to understand the decline in walking and cycling because the wind impacts these unprotected active travel modes directly
(Saneinejad et al., 2012; Flynn et al., 2012). Speci<U+FB01>cally, the bicycle mode is more sensitive to the in<U+FB02>uence of high wind speeds than
the walking mode. For a 1 m/s increase in wind speed, the probabilities of walking and cycling are expected to decrease by 0.4% and
0.8%, respectively, while for a 5 m/s increase in wind speed, the drop is 1.8% and 3.5%, respectively, according to the MNP model.
Furthermore, public transport is also unwelcome on windy days. Note that students typically walk to bus stops, and they also have to
wait for the bus, which would directly expose them to the wind. Such a result is consistent with those of previous studies (e.g., Guo
et al., 2007; Arana et al., 2014). Note that these qualitative results regarding wind speed are consistent between the MNP and MNL
models.
6.2.3. Highest temperature
     The responding modal shifts with respect to the highest temperature increments of 2 °C and 4 °C were investigated. The trend
remains consistent for the two di<U+FB00>erent settings; with an increase in the highest temperature, walking and public transport become
less attractive. This <U+FB01>nding is consistent with Liu et al. (2015a), who showed that commuters tend to walk less when the temperature
rises on a “colder than normal” day. The reason is that when the temperature rises in winter, cycling and driving becomes safer (Zhou
et al., 2017) because, in cold winter weather, with a temperature below 0 °C (the lowest temperature ranged from -8°C to 0 °C during
the survey), the pavement may be icy and prone to tra<U+FB03>c accidents.
     Of all four modes, cycling is the most sensitive to temperature variations; its market share is expected to increase by 14.7% for an
increase in the highest temperature by 4 °C according to the MNP model. This is in line with the results obtained by Helbich et al.
(2014), whereas some contrary results (Noland, 1995; Amiri and Sadeghpour, 2014) have also been found. Note that these qualitative
results regarding the highest temperature are consistent between the MNP and MNL models.
6.2.4. AQI
     To our knowledge, no studies have considered the impact of the AQI on school commuting behaviors. One possible reason is that
the AQI in the study areas of past studies was low and had small variations and hence imposed a negligible in<U+FB02>uence on travel
behaviors. However, the estimated model indicates that the AQI has a signi<U+FB01>cant impact on school commute mode choices in Beijing.
According to Table 4, the mode shares vary slightly when the AQI changes from good to poor, with the average probability of
walking, cycling and taking public transport decreasing by 3.4%, 5.9%, and 6.0%, respectively, whereas choosing to use a car
increases by 14.7% (MNP model). However, when air pollution changes from poor to terrible, there is a striking shift in the commute
mode choices.
     Children are known to be more vulnerable to the adverse e<U+FB00>ects of air pollution than adults. Epidemiological studies have
reported that the developing lungs of a child are highly susceptible to damage after exposure to air pollution and may show decreased
growth in lung functions (Kim, 2004). The estimation results indicate that when the AQI deteriorates from poor to terrible, an average
of 16.4% of walkers and 93.9% of cyclists abandoned the active transport mode to avoid exposure to air pollution. These students
turned instead to public transport and cars, resulting in a 35.0% increase in the public transport mode and a 16.4% increase in the car
mode. Interestingly, public transport is more appealing than cars provided that the AQI rises to “terrible,” which is counterintuitive
because the car mode provides better air quality due to its air conditioning system. One of the reasons is that some households do not
own a vehicle in Beijing due to the special policy controlling citywide vehicle ownership (see Section 3.1 of this paper). Moreover,
during days with extremely terrible air quality, only half of the vehicles are allowed to travel, with rotations based on the last digit of
the license plate numbers in Beijing. To some extent, these special regulations prevent students from choosing cars for their commute
to school. Note that these qualitative results regarding the AQI are consistent between the MNP and MNL models.
6.2.5. Humidity
     As shown in many studies, humidity a<U+FB00>ects travelers’ mode choice behaviors (Aultman-Hall et al., 2009; Amiri and Sadeghpour,
2014; Nankervis, 1999; Liu et al., 2015a). In this study, empirical sensitivities corresponding to 10% and 20% humidity increases
were investigated. Among the four modes, walking is the least sensitive to humidity variations, which is in line with Aultman-Hall
et al. (2009), who found that humidity has a limited e<U+FB00>ect on pedestrians. In contrast, the bicycle mode share drops substantially for
an increase in humidity. According to the MNP model, the sensitive e<U+FB00>ect indicates that 15.9% of cyclists turn to other modes when
the humidity increases by 20%. The MNP model also indicates that the public transport and car modes are positively a<U+FB00>ected by an
increase in humidity. Speci<U+FB01>cally, a 20% increase in humidity is associated with a 3.1% rise in public transport and a 4.3% rise in car
usage. In the cold season, the perceived temperature is lower than the air temperature under higher humidity, making the public
transport and car modes more favorable to students than the active modes. According to the MNL model, the public transport mode is
not sensitive to variations in humidity. Minor reductions (0.1% and 0.4% for humidity increases of 10% and 20%, respectively) of
public transport use were found. The reduction in the active mode commutes makes students turn to using cars.
6.2.6. Commute distance
    Commute distance has long been recognized as an important variable a<U+FB00>ecting mode choice decisions (Ewing et al., 2004; Fyhri
and Hjorthol, 2009; Müller et al., 2008). However, there are no <U+FB01>xed rules for which modes become more attractive with an increase
in distance; how these modes shift will depend on the actual increase in that distance. Thus, this study investigates the e<U+FB00>ects of three
di<U+FB00>erent increments (1 km, 2 km, and 5 km) of distance on school commute mode choices. As the distance increases, the propensity
for the walking mode is consistently reduced. For a 5 km increment in distance, nearly not students walk to school (a 98.7% drop).
Meanwhile, the proportion of students using public transport and cars increases dramatically.
    As for the bicycle mode, its use is not consistently reduced with an increase in distance. According to the MNP model, the number of
students choosing the bicycle mode for their school commute is reduced by 47.7% when the distance increases by 5 km, while it slightly
increases (0.8%) for a 1 km increment in distance. However, such a result has rarely been investigated in previous studies focusing on
school commute mode choices. Note that these qualitative results regarding distance are consistent between the MNP and MNL models.
6.2.7. Age of student
    The ages of the studied students range from 12 to 14, corresponding to grades 7 to 9. Older students are more likely to walk to
school, which is in line with previous studies (e.g., Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014). However, the market share of bicycle
commutes decreases substantially when the age increases from 12 to 13, which contradicts some prior studies (e.g., Wati and Tranter,
2015). In China, many parents use a children’s seat on their bicycles or e-bicycles to transport their children to school. Thus, as the
students become more independent as they grow older, the market share of bicycle commutes decreases because of the reduction in
the number of students going to school on a children’s bicycle seat.
    Regarding the public transport and car modes, their shifts are relatively small in contrast to the walking and bicycle modes. This is
probably because the age range in this study is too narrow to re<U+FB02>ect a substantial variation. In fact, students have more <U+FB02>exibility when
making mode choice decisions for their school commutes as they become more independent (e.g., He and Giuliano, 2017). Thus, for older
students, more frequent car commutes are expected, which is probably because some of them are able to take a taxi or e-hail a car by
themselves. Slight discrepancies were found between the MNP and MNL models in the shifts for the public transport and car modes for
students of age 12 to 13. The MNP model indicates a 1.4% decrease and a 2.6% increase in the public transport and car modes, respectively, whereas the MNL model indicates a 3.0% increase and a 2.1% increase in the public transport and car modes, respectively.
6.3. Two-variable sensitivity
    The above analyses considered the impact of a single variable on school commute mode choices. It is also interesting to explore
how the modal split of school commutes reacts to simultaneous changes in two variables. In a linear regression model, the interaction
e<U+FB00>ects between variables can be investigated directly through the coe<U+FB03>cient associated with the interaction terms. However, in the
MNP and MNL models, we can understand the interaction e<U+FB00>ects only through the coe<U+FB03>cients associated with the interaction terms.
The probability function is nonlinearly related to the interaction term and the corresponding marginal terms as well as other variables, making the e<U+FB00>ect from the interaction term confounded by other variables. Speci<U+FB01>cally, the interaction term and the corresponding marginal terms are inherently connected, leading to a more di<U+FB03>cult situation for interpretation. This section presents the
empirical sensitivities with respect to di<U+FB00>erent combined changes in two variables. Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate the empirical sensitivities
for the combination of the highest temperature plus humidity and the AQI plus commute distance, respectively. The trend lines of one
variable for di<U+FB00>erent levels of the other variable are shown. If these lines are parallel to each other, we can assume that the interaction e<U+FB00>ect between these variables is small (in the sense of the de<U+FB01>ned sensitivity).
6.3.1. Highest temperature plus humidity
    Along with an increase in the highest temperature, the variation in the sensitivity of the walking mode due to humidity increases.
However, there is no obvious interaction e<U+FB00>ect between the highest temperature and humidity on the sensitivities for both the bicycle
and public transport modes. For the public transport and car modes, the sensitivities are substantially di<U+FB00>erent between the MNP and
MNL models. In the MNP model, the usage of the public transport and car modes is less sensitive to the changes in both the highest
temperature and humidity, and the interaction e<U+FB00>ects between the highest temperature and humidity are not substantial, which is
probably because the range of the highest temperature during the survey period is too narrow to re<U+FB02>ect their interaction. In fact, high
humidity could make the weather feel colder in winter, leading to a larger decrease in bicycle school commutes.
6.3.2. AQI plus commute distance
    Fig. 3 illustrates the empirical sensitivities with respect to di<U+FB00>erent combined changes in the AQI and commute distance for both
the MNP and MNL models. The two models illustrate similar in<U+FB02>uence patterns for the combined changes of the two variables on all
four school commute modes. For the walking mode, there is no obvious interaction e<U+FB00>ect between the two variables at the low levels
of distance increases (less than 2 km); as the distance continues to increase, the sensitivity of the walking mode decreases rapidly as
the AQI changes from good to poor.
    As the AQI changes from poor to terrible, there are almost no bicycle school commutes, even for a smaller increase in distance (1
km). Thus, the e<U+FB00>ect of distance is negligible. For a better AQI condition, the commute distance exhibits a large in<U+FB02>uence on the
probability of the bicycle mode. For the public transport mode, the interaction e<U+FB00>ect is not substantial. For the car mode, given that
the AQI changes from good to poor, the sensitivity increases along with an increase in the commute distance. However, if the AQI
continues to deteriorate along with an increase in the commute distance, car usage increases at a lower rate and eventually ceases to
grow, remaining at a <U+FB01>xed level.
7. Discussion and conclusions
7.1. General conclusions and practical implications
   This paper aims to examine the impact of weather conditions on middle school students' commuting behaviors, speci<U+FB01>cally
focusing on commute mode choice decisions. One of the intentions of this study is to understand how the students’ decisions shift
with respect to variations in in<U+FB02>uential factors, with empirical emphases on the situation in Beijing. The latest school commute survey
data for Beijing was collected and input into the MNP and MNL models. The estimation results present many important <U+FB01>ndings not
only in terms of identifying speci<U+FB01>c factors that in<U+FB02>uence school commute mode choice behaviors but also in terms of quantifying the
magnitude of the e<U+FB00>ects and how this magnitude may vary across mode alternatives.
    This study investigates the e<U+FB00>ects of each factor with respect to multi-level changes, and hence more complicated behaviors are
revealed, illustrating nonmonotonic in<U+FB02>uential patterns for some variables. Most of the results can be explained by general conclusions from previous studies. There are also contrary <U+FB01>ndings, which re<U+FB02>ect the special situation in Beijing. For example, some
households do not own a car because car ownership is restricted in Beijing and car travel is also highly restricted during days of
extremely terrible air quality. Therefore, when air quality attains the “terrible” level, students rely more on public transport than cars.
    These results could have important implications for future transportation development and may provide references for policymakers
and planners. First, developing a school bus system is strongly suggested because the regular public transport system would face high
pressure on days with poor sky conditions or terrible air quality. Equipping school buses with an air <U+FB01>ltering system is also recommended.
Second, active transportation modes should be encouraged in good weather conditions. As illustrated, the commute distance is the most
direct and in<U+FB02>uential factor playing a crucial role in the decision-making process of school commute mode choices. A 1 km increase in
distance results in 34.9% fewer students walking to school according to the MNP model. One strategic suggestion is to consider the
commute distance when selecting sites for new schools. Because the data were collected during winter, the conclusions are limited to
winter situations. More general conclusions would require further veri<U+FB01>cation using data collected during other seasons.
7.2. Limitations and future directions of research
    The current variable setting is su<U+FB03>cient for an understanding of the macroscopic-level relationships between school commute
mode choices and weather conditions and hence for proposing strategic policies and planning implications. However, these sensitivity measures will change under di<U+FB00>erent variable settings. Some unobserved variables could play an important role in our understanding of the decision-making process of school commute mode choices. Thus, in future studies, it would be useful to include
additional explanatory variables, such as household and parents’ attributes, land-use mix, urban forms, and characteristics of
transportation facilities to enhance the modeling performance and to re<U+FB01>ne the behavioral results. Another avenue for tackling this
issue is to use more advanced econometrical models, e.g., the random-parameters model and the <U+FB01>nite mixture model, to consider
potential heterogeneities originating from unobserved variables.
    Weather conditions comprise many di<U+FB00>erent aspects. Due to the survey duration, which covered only two winter months, seasonal
variations and precipitation were not observed in the dataset. Hence, the models and corresponding results are necessary to be re-estimated when data for other seasons or on days with rain or snow become available.
    In addition to the issue of variable setting, the modeling results also rely on di<U+FB00>erent cities and student groups. It would also be
interesting to compare our current results with other student groups or other cities in China as well as cities in other countries.
