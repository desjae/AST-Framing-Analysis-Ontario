Keeping kids safe for active travel to school: A mixed method examination of                                                                                 
school policies and practices and children’s school travel behaviour

abstract
Active school travel contributes to children’s physical, mental and social wellbeing. The prevalence of children’s
active school travel, however, has been declining in many developed countries. Gaining insights into school
culture and environments in relation to school travel behaviour is crucial to inform interventions. Using a
multiphase mixed methods approach, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how school
policies and practices supported or inhibited school travel behaviour in Auckland, New Zealand. Data were
drawn from Neighbourhoods for Active Kids, a cross-sectional study of 1085 children aged 8–13 years between
February 2015 and December 2016. School representatives were interviewed regarding their policies and
practices related to school travel behaviour and tra<U+FB03>c around school, and the data were analysed thematically.
An overarching theme, sub-themes and categories were contextualised for quantitative modelling using objectively 
measured school variables (school socioeconomic status, active school travel programme, built environments 
around school). Mixed e<U+FB00>ects multinomial logistic regression models were employed to determine associations 
between school travel mode and objectively measured child (sociodemographic characteristics, tra<U+FB03>c
safety perceptions) and school variables. Safety was the core concept of school travel policies, procedures and
programmes. Signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences in child variables, school socioeconomic status, and cycle lanes and tra<U+FB03>c
lights around school were found between children who actively travelled or used public transport to school and
those driven to school. Overall, this study demonstrated the important role of school policy and procedures and
the potential application of an intersectoral approach for interventions to support changes in school travel behaviour.

1. Introduction                                                                                  
												
Childhood physical inactivity underlies a number of non-communicable 
diseases (e.g., heart disease, stroke, some cancers, diabetes),                          
and has given rise to a global phenomenon of child obesity and overweight 
(World Health Organization, 2018). According to the 2018                                  
Global Matrix 3.0 Physical Activity Report Card, the average percentage                          
of children and youth who met recommendations on physical activity                               
for health (i.e., at least 60 min of daily moderate-to-vigorous intensity                        
physical activity) ranged from 27 to 33% (Aubert et al., 2018).                                  
Active travel (e.g., walking and cycling from place to place) is a key                      

way of accumulating physical activity on a daily basis (Faulkner et al.,
2009; Larouche et al., 2014b), and improving physical, mental and
social wellbeing (Ikeda et al., 2018a; Larouche et al., 2014b; Sun et al.,
2015; Van Dijk et al., 2014). Mode shifts from passive (i.e., motorised)
travel to active travel can also contribute to environmental sustainability 
and economic bene<U+FB01>ts (Grabow et al., 2012; Hosking et al.,
2011; Lindsay et al., 2011; Woodcock et al., 2009; Zapata-Diomedi
et al., 2017). Despite these bene<U+FB01>ts, a low prevalence of active travel in
children and youth and a car-centric culture has been an issue particularly 
in North America, UK, Australia, New Zealand and other developed 
countries (Aubert et al., 2018; Sattlegger and Rau, 2016). Over

the last <U+FB01>ve years, however, a plateau (e.g., New Zealand, South Africa)
or slight improvement (e.g., USA, Australia) in active travel has been
observed. One potential contribution to this status is the rapid growth
of programmes to promote active travel particularly focusing on school
travel behaviour such as Safe Routes to School, School Travel Plans, and
walking school buses (Aubert et al., 2018; Ikeda et al., in press;
Larouche et al., 2018; Tremblay et al., 2016; Tremblay et al., 2014).
New Zealand, with a total population of just under <U+FB01>ve million in
2019 (Statistics New Zealand, 2019), has sprawling urban development
and high car dependency (Leung et al., 2017). The New Zealand Health
Survey 2016/17 showed less than half (45%) of children and youth ages
5–14 years usually actively travelled to school (Ministry of Health,
2017). Those children and youth who usually travel actively are more
likely to be male and older children (ages 10–14 years) than female,
younger children or older adolescents (Smith et al., 2018). Traditionally, 
active school travel has been higher in children and youth living in
areas of higher deprivation; however, recent data suggest this pattern
may be shifting (Ikeda et al., 2018a; Ministry of Health, 2014, 2015,
2017). Research that identi<U+FB01>es factors associated with active school
travel and evaluates existing policies and interventions for active school
travel will be indispensable to build knowledge of ‘what works for
whom in what context’ (Larouche et al., 2018).
A complex mechanism of associations between school travel behaviour 
and multiple factors at individual, social, environmental and
policy levels has been thoroughly documented (Ikeda et al., in press).
Ikeda and colleagues (2019) developed the Children’s School Travel
Behaviour Model (C-STBM) and demonstrated direct and indirect
(mediated) relationships between school travel behaviour and six domains 
(i.e., built environment, social environment, household characteristics, 
household beliefs, child characteristics, child beliefs) in the
context of Auckland, New Zealand. With the exception of household
characteristics, active school travel was signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with
one or more variables from the <U+FB01>ve domains (i.e., objectively-measured
distance to school; neighbourhood social environment; household beliefs 
about tra<U+FB03>c safety, social interaction and convenience; child age
and sex; child beliefs of neighbourhood safety, and independent mobility) 
(Ikeda et al., 2019). Despite acknowledging the important role of
the school environment (i.e., policy and practices) in the C-STBM, the
previous study omitted this seventh domain due to an insu<U+FB03>cient
sample size of schools (n = 19) in order to perform multilevel analyses
in structural equation modelling (Ikeda et al., 2019). This study,
therefore, continues to test the C-STBM particularly focusing on the
domain of the school environment associated with school travel behaviour.

A school acts as a facilitator of interventions for active school travel
by providing safe and supportive environments, and as a key driver of
reinforcing active school travel habits and values (Buttazzoni et al.,
2018; Crawford and Garrard, 2013; Hawley et al., 2019). Love and
colleagues (2019) evaluated three interventions for school travel behaviour 
and independent mobility in Australian children (i.e., TravelSmart, 
Ride to School, Safe Routes to School). Social capital (i.e.,
social connectedness) of the school and community and the power of
school culture had the most in<U+FB02>uential impact on the e<U+FB00>ectiveness of
the interventions (Love et al., 2019). Interviews from exemplar schools
(i.e., those with relatively high active school travel rates) in New
Zealand showed that there was an interactive relationship between
school culture, community culture and the built environment, which
were ‘common ingredients’ across these schools (Hawley et al., 2019).
School representatives regarded the built environment around the
school (e.g. walking and cycling infrastructure, tra<U+FB03>c calming) as underpinning 
safety (i.e., tra<U+FB03>c, personal) (Hawley et al., 2019; Smith
et al., Under review), the second strongest correlate of active school
travel after distance to school (Ikeda et al., 2018a; Rothman et al.,
2018). As Panter and Colleagues (2019) highlighted, qualitative or
mixed method studies are often scarce and rated as low quality in
systematic reviews on travel behaviour. However, these sources can

provide insights into potential contexts and mechanisms of how interventions 
work, as well as in-depth examination of what factors in<U+FB02>uence 
a speci<U+FB01>c behaviour (Crawford and Garrard, 2013; Larouche et al.,
2018; Panter et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2019a).
Little is known of how di<U+FB00>erent school travel behaviours (e.g.,
walking, cycling/scootering/skateboarding, public transport, car) are
associated with speci<U+FB01>c perceptions of and in<U+FB02>uences from environments 
(e.g., distance to school) (Mandic et al., 2017; Trapp et al.,
2011). Public transport, for example, tends to be categorised as passive/
motorised travel owning to its emissions and relative time spent being
physically inactive (Ikeda et al., 2018b; Woodcock et al., 2009). However, 
it is argued that public transport is unique in terms of activity
level (Rissel et al., 2012; Saelens et al., 2014; Villanueva et al., 2008;
Voss et al., 2015) as well as environmental exposure and associated
perceptions. Examining school travel behaviours separately may give
novel and speci<U+FB01>c information of what facilitates and hinders each
behaviour.
In this study, a multiphase mixed methods design was used to
provide a comprehensive understanding of how school policies and
practices supported and inhibited school travel behaviour in the context
of Auckland, New Zealand. The study was guided by three objectives:
(1) to identify school policies and practices related to school travel
behaviour and tra<U+FB03>c around school using interview data; (2) to contextualise 
emergent themes in relation to objectively measured child
and school variables; and (3) to determine associations between school
travel behaviour with objectively measured child and school variables.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study design and context

This study utilised a multiphase mixed methods design in which
qualitative and quantitative components were implemented concurrently 
(e.g., data collection) as well as sequentially (e.g., data analysis). 
Data were drawn from Neighbourhoods for Active Kids, a crosssectional 
study examining relationships between the built environment
and a range of children’s activity behaviours and health outcomes in
Auckland (most populated region in New Zealand with a third of the
national population) (Statistics New Zealand, 2013). The full study
design, methods and measures are described elsewhere (Oliver et al.,
2016). Brie<U+FB02>y, intermediate schools (junior high school, years 7–8, ages
10–13 years) in Auckland were selected based on a matrix of school
decile (i.e., a measure of neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status),
and child-speci<U+FB01>c measures of walkability (Giles-Corti et al., 2011) and
destination accessibility (Badland et al., 2015) around each school’s
geocoded address, with the purpose of increasing heterogeneity in these
variables across the participating schools and their neighbourhoods.
The diversity of geographic locations of the schools (north, south, east,
west and central Auckland) was also taken into account. A neighbouring 
contributing primary school (elementary school, years 1–6,
ages 5–11 years) for each intermediate school was also invited, to
create a primary-intermediate school dyad in each neighbourhood.
A total of 19 state (i.e., government-funded and -operated) schools
(nine intermediate and 10 primary) consented to participate in the
study. Child data collection was conducted in the school setting, where
the participants completed an online participatory geographic information 
systems (GIS) survey (https://maptionnaire.com) with one-on-one 
support from trained researchers (Kahila and Kyttä, 2009; Kyttä
and Kahila, 2011; Kyttä et al., 2018). The survey included items on
children’s usual mode of travel to school, their perceptions on neighbourhood 
and tra<U+FB03>c safety, as well as mapping activity on their usual
route to school. After the completion of child data collection, a computer-assisted 
telephone interview (CATI) survey was conducted with
parents/caregivers of participating children. A face-to-face or telephone-based 
semi-structured interview with a school principal or representative 
from each school was conducted to explore school policies

and practices related to school travel behaviour and tra<U+FB03>c around
school. Demographic information (i.e., school year (grade) and sex) of
participating children were also reported by the school. All data from
children, parents/caregivers and schools were collected between February 
2015 and December 2016. On completion of the data collection,
built environment attributes were objectively measured around the
child’s school routes and school neighbourhood environment using GIS
(e.g., Ikeda et al. (2018b), Ikeda et al. (2019)). Ethical approval to
conduct the study was granted by the host institution ethics committees
(AUTEC, 14/263, 3 September 2014; MUHECN, 9 September 2014;
UAHPEC, 9 September 2014).

2.2. Measures

Measures speci<U+FB01>c to the current study are described below.

2.2.1. Child measures
Children reported their usual mode of travel to school using online
participatory GIS by answering “How do you usually get to school?” with
responses of ‘walk’, ‘bike’, ‘scooter (non-motorised)’, ‘skateboard’,
‘public transport’, or ‘car’. Due to the small number of bike (n = 42),
scooter (n = 35) and skateboard (n = 6), these were combined into
‘wheel’ (n = 83), resulting in four categories in total: ‘walk’, ‘wheel’,
‘public transport’ and ‘car’. School year (5 to 8) and sex (male or female) 
were reported by schools, and ethnicity (classi<U+FB01>ed as New
Zealand European, Maori, Paci<U+FB01>c, Asian, or other) by schools or parents/caregivers 
(if the school did not provide this information). Tra<U+FB03>c
safety perceptions were measured by two items (“The roads around my
school are busy with tra<U+FB03>c before and after school”; “The roads around my
school are full of parked cars before and after school”) with a 4-point
Likert scale (all of the time, most of the time, sometimes, hardly ever/
never) (Mullan, 2003).

2.2.2. School measures

2.2.2.1. Socioeconomic status. A school decile is a relative rating of the
socioeconomic position of a school community in New Zealand. Decile
1 indicates the 10% of schools with the highest proportion of students
attending from areas of greatest socio-economic deprivation; while
decile 10 schools are those with the lowest proportion of students
attending from areas of greatest socio-economic deprivation (Ministry
of Education, 2019). School decile ratings were categorised into three
groups: low (deciles 1 to 3), medium (deciles 4 to 7) and high (deciles 8
to 10).

2.2.2.2. Policy and practices. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were
guided by two topics: (1) school policies and practices related to school
travel behaviour, and (2) tra<U+FB03>c around school. In relation to the <U+FB01>rst
topic, a closed question about the involvement of active school travel
programmes (e.g., Travelwise, walking school bus) was also asked
(presence or absence).
Travelwise is a programme that has been developed through Safe
School Travel Plans (i.e., an action plan for road safety and active
travel) by Auckland Transport, and aims to create a safer tra<U+FB03>c environment 
in the immediate school environment (Auckland Transport,
2019a). The Travelwise programme is supported by three pillars: curriculum 
(e.g., providing student-centred, curriculum based road safety,
and active transport education programmes); ethos and organisation
(e.g., reviewing policies, guidelines, and school tra<U+FB03>c environment);
and parents and community (e.g., providing parents with information
and engaging school community and stakeholders) (Auckland
Transport, 2019a). This needs-based approach could also involve infrastructural 
changes (e.g., installation of pedestrian crossings). The
programme is delivered in collaboration with the school community,
Auckland Council, New Zealand Police, New Zealand Transport Agency,
and other organisations (Auckland Transport, 2019c). A walking school
bus is a group of children walking to/from school under the minimum

supervision of parent volunteers (Auckland Transport, 2019d). Walking
school buses were not in operation for intermediate schools. The Travelwise 
programme was, however, in operation across primary, intermediate 
and secondary schools and, therefore, of particular interest in
the current analysis.

2.2.2.3. Built environment around the school. Objective measures of the
built environment were generated in ArcGIS 10.2 (Environmental
Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, California, USA) using
an 800 m pedestrian network bu<U+FB00>er area around each school address.
The bu<U+FB00>er scale of 800 m was selected based on the median distance
(calculated using pedestrian network) of participating children who
actively travelled to school (median: 800.3 m) (Ikeda et al., 2018b). The
pedestrian network included all road classi<U+FB01>cations except motorways/
state highways to best estimate possible environments for active
travellers (Ikeda et al., 2018b).
Tra<U+FB03>c exposure: Total lengths of high and low tra<U+FB03>c roads (km)
within the de<U+FB01>ned bu<U+FB00>er were calculated. High (i.e., arterial rural/
urban, major rural/urban and medium rural/urban) and low (i.e., low
tra<U+FB03>c roads included access rural/urban, minor rural/urban and foot
path/track) tra<U+FB03>c roads were determined based on road classi<U+FB01>cation
from the 2015 Corelogic Transport dataset as a proxy for tra<U+FB03>c volume
(Ikeda et al., 2019; Ikeda et al., 2018b).
School walkability: A school walkability index was generated using:
(1) the ratio of the length of high to low tra<U+FB03>c roads within the de<U+FB01>ned
bu<U+FB00>er (i.e., tra<U+FB03>c exposure), and (2) the ratio of the pedestrian network
area within the bu<U+FB00>er area delineated using a Euclidian distance (of
800 m) to the Euclidian bu<U+FB00>er area (i.e., Pedshed) (Giles-Corti et al.,
2011). Both tra<U+FB03>c exposure and Pedshed measures were collapsed into
deciles, and the tra<U+FB03>c exposure decile was reverse coded (i.e.,
1 = most tra<U+FB03>c to 10 = least tra<U+FB03>c). The two measures were summed,
resulting in scores ranging from 2 (least walkable) to 20 (most walkable) 
(Giles-Corti et al., 2011).
Child-speci<U+FB01>c neighbourhood destination accessibility index (NDAI-
C): The NDAI-C is a weighted measure of accessibility based on the
proportion of trips made to 28 neighbourhood destinations (e.g.,
schools, sports facilities, parks) by children (Badland et al., 2015). A
binary scoring system was used to determine the presence or absence of
each destination within the de<U+FB01>ned bu<U+FB00>er. The NDAI-C (0 to 100) was
calculated by the sum of values multiplied by the weight (post o<U+FB03>ce:
0.04 to primary school: 50.65) and score (0 or 1) of each destination
(Badland et al., 2015).
Cycle lane: Cycle lane length (CLL; km) derived from the Auckland
Transport’s Open GIS Data Website (Auckland Transport, 2019b) and
all road lengths (ARL; km) derived from the 2015 CoreLogic Transport
dataset were generated within the de<U+FB01>ned bu<U+FB00>er. The ratio of CLL/ARL
was calculated, where a higher ratio denotes more cycle lanes available
relative to all road types (Smith et al., 2019a).
Tra<U+FB03>c lights: The ratio of tra<U+FB03>c lights (i.e., controlled intersections) 
to area of the de<U+FB01>ned bu<U+FB00>er was calculated (which were rescaled
by multiplying by 106). Tra<U+FB03>c light data were obtained from the 2015
CoreLogic Transport dataset.

2.3. Data analysis

2.3.1. Objective one
Interviews with school principals and representatives were transcribed 
verbatim and thematic analysis was performed to <U+FB01>nd repeated
patterns of meaning within the entire data (across individual interviews) 
(Braun and Clarke, 2006). Themes which captured important
elements of school policy and practices related to school travel behaviour 
and tra<U+FB03>c around school were identi<U+FB01>ed inductively. The <U+FB01>rst
author (EI) read and re-read transcripts to become familiarised with the
data, developed an initial coding frame and coded data using NVivo
(QSR International Pty Ltd. Version 12). After the re<U+FB01>nement (e.g.,
adding, subtracting, combining) of the codes, all relevant codes were

collated to form an overarching theme, sub-themes and categories, and
to develop a thematic map (Fig. 1). The overarching theme, sub-themes
and categories were reviewed by the last author (MS) to ascertain their
accurate representation of the content of the entire data. In accordance
with the objective of this mixed methods study, the themes were
identi<U+FB01>ed within the explicit meanings of the data (i.e., semantic content).

2.3.2. Objective two

Out of all themes and categories identi<U+FB01>ed in the qualitative data,
the overarching theme, sub-themes and categories corresponding to
objectively measured child and school variables were selected and used
for further quantitative analyses to contextualise participants’ narrative
accounts (Table 1) (e.g., Smith et al. (2019a)).

2.3.3. Objective three
Mixed e<U+FB00>ects multinomial logistic regression models were used to
account for the correlation structure of the data when determining associations 
between school travel behaviour and objectively measured
child and school variables (Appendix A). The models were estimated
using a quasi-maximum likelihood method, and Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) were used as
model <U+FB01>t indices. The outcome variable was school travel mode, in
which car was a reference category and compared with walk, wheel,
and public transport modes. The estimated intraclass correlation coef<U+FB01>cients 
(ICCs) were calculated for neighbourhood and school to evaluate 
whether clustering by either neighbourhoods (primary-intermediate school dyad) 
or schools would account for a signi<U+FB01>cant
proportion of the total variance in school travel mode (i.e., the amount

of correlation among individuals within the same neighbourhood or
school) (Heck et al., 2012). The clustering e<U+FB00>ect was then accounted for
by including a random intercept for that factor in all subsequent
models. Model building was performed by <U+FB01>rst applying separate
models for variables regarding children’s sociodemographics (Model

1a), children’s perceptions on tra<U+FB03>c safety (Model 1b) and school
measures (school decile, Travelwise and built environment around
school: Models 2a-2c). All variables with a p-value < 0.1 from omnibus
F tests were then added to the <U+FB01>nal model (Model 3). The base
model (Model 1a) was kept constant in all models. To assess for potential 
multicollinearity between built environment attributes, variance

in<U+FB02>ation factor (VIF) and Pearson correlations were calculated. A p-related 
to school travel behaviour and tra<U+FB03>c around school.
value threshold of 0.05 was employed to determine statistical signi<U+FB01>cance 
in the <U+FB01>nal model (Model 3). Sensitivity analyses were performed 
by comparing model <U+FB01>t in the <U+FB01>nal model with that in models
with di<U+FB00>erent random intercept and variable. All analyses were performed 
in SPSS (IBM Cooperation Version 25).

3. Results

3.1. Objective One: School policy and practices related to school travel

behaviour and tra<U+FB03>c around school
Safety was strongly embedded in school policy and practices and
identi<U+FB01>ed as an overarching theme (“The policy is, that obviously it’s
vital the kids are safe <U+FB01>rst and foremost getting to and from school.”).
This theme was related to six sub-themes and <U+FB01>ve categories (under the
sub-theme of policy, procedure and programme), as outlined in Fig. 1 and
Table 1. Safety concerns were evident in procedures around active
school travel (e.g., students who cycle or scooter to school must wear a
helmet and go through bike training) and drop o<U+FB00> and pick up (“We have
a drop o<U+FB00> zone for parents with their cars and that’s, you know monitored.”). 
An issue of school zone was also discussed, where a large
number of enrolments out of zone contributed to an increase in passive
travel from/to school (“It’s the parents, the parents usually drop the
children at school because most of our children arrive at school after
receiving a lift because we have 85% of our roll live out of zone.”).
In terms of tra<U+FB03>c safety, pedestrian crossing was identi<U+FB01>ed as the
place where most dangers and risks were involved partially due to high
tra<U+FB03>c volume and speed around school:

“A little kid standing with his scooter, he's waiting at the pedestrian

crossing and the cars just keep zooming past him.”

Most schools set school patrol which are crossing points controlled
and monitored by teachers and/or students:

“We have children working on the crossing so we encourage kids to

cross there. It’s got a teacher manning it every day.”

The majority of schools organised road safety education for students
which was primarily run in partnership with community police,
Auckland Transport, and Auckland Council. A few schools addressed a
need for educating parents:

“I guess our huge concern is sometimes the danger that parents

expose the children to by the places that they cross. So, as I say we
need the parent education.”
“We tell them [parents] we don't want them to be dropping them
[children] o<U+FB00> in the bus bay, we have the pedestrian crossing for the
children to use in the morning to get from the other side to here, and
we would prefer that they, the parents who are dropping the children o<U+FB00>, 
did not use the bus bay where buses are coming in, dropping children o<U+FB00>.”
School awareness of the Travelwise and walking school bus were recounted 
by all school principals and representatives. Compared to the
Travelwise programme (which works with primary, intermediate and
secondary schools, and is run by Auckland Transport and other collaborators), 
walking school buses were predominantly operated in primary 
schools, and heavily rely on parental support.

“We do have a walking school bus or two that run and they’re [run]
really well, those parents that run those are really committed to that
work.”

Advantages of the Travelwise programme were highlighted in terms
of the provision of pedestrian crossings and walking and cycling infra-
structure around school (e.g., cycle lanes, tra<U+FB03>c calming and islands)
and the encouragement of active school travel. The patterns of pedestrian 
crossing were di<U+FB00>erentiated from walking and cycling infrastructure
because school principals and representatives exclusively and explicitly
delivered a narrative of pedestrian crossings particularly in relation to
policy, procedure and programme and education (Fig. 1).
“Well,…there’s been things done with the Travelwise and they’ve

now been <U+FB01>ddling around here with the pedestrian crossing. They’re
just putting in the crossing that we’ve been trying to get for
20 years.”
“The Travelwise team get out there and have special days where the
kids walk, a walking day or they’ll have a day where if you walk you
get a sticker at the gate or there’s people waiting for you at the gate
with balloons or something if you walk to school you get something,
so that all encourages them.”
School principals and representatives believed that a dearth of pedestrian 
crossings and cycle lanes around school was a critical barrier to
active school travel.

3.2. Objective two: Contextualisation of the overarching theme, sub-themes
and categories

The overarching theme, sub-themes and categories identi<U+FB01>ed from
the qualitative data re<U+FB02>ected similarities in issues of, and strategies for,
school travel behaviour across schools. Despite these commonalities,
di<U+FB00>erences in school travel behaviour between schools existed
(Appendix B), indicating the provision of quanti<U+FB01>able data to contextualise 
these overarching theme, sub-themes and categories was
warranted. The overarching theme, sub-themes and categories were
selected based on the availability of objectively measured child and
school variables in the Neighbourhoods for Active Kids study (Table 1),
which informed quantitative modelling.

objectively measured child and school variables                                               
												
3.3.1. Characteristics of participating children and schools                                  
Data from 1085 children across 19 schools were included in analyses. 
Descriptive information for objectively measured child and school                      
variables is presented in Table 2. Just under half (46.1%) of children                        
were driven to school, and 34.3% walked. A minority (7.6%) used                               
wheels with half of these children cycling to school (3.9%). Over half of                     
children in years 5 (58.3%) and 6 (53.8%) travelled by car compared                           
with approximately one-third of those in years 7 (35.0%) and 8                                
(36.7%). Boys were more likely to actively travel to school (walk:                            
37.8%, wheel: 12.2%) than girls (walk: 31.1%, wheel: 3.3%). With the                          
exception of New Zealand European children (whose most common                                 
mode was walking), car travel was the most common travel mode to                              
school across the ethnic groups.                                                              
												
3.3.2. Model building using mixed e<U+FB00>ects multinomial logistic regression                      
models                                                                                        
The overall procedure of model building is presented in Appendix A.                      
The assessment of ICC showed little evidence of variability in the school                     
travel mode between neighbourhoods but a signi<U+FB01>cant proportion of                             
variance between schools. A random intercept for school was, therefore,                       
included in all mixed e<U+FB00>ects multinomial logistic regression models.                          
The estimated proportions of variance in school travel mode between                           

schools were 13.92% (95% con<U+FB01>dence interval (CI): 6.77–26.50%) for
walk versus car, 27.83% (95% CI: 13.68–48.40%) for wheel versus car,
and 50.10% (95% CI: 30.54–69.63%) for public transport versus car.
Potential multicollinearity was detected from VIF and Pearson correlations 
which resulted in removing lengths of low tra<U+FB03>c roads from the
built environment measures. A listwise deletion method was used to
handle missing data in child tra<U+FB03>c safety variables (busy tra<U+FB03>c: n = 2,
parked cars: n = 4 including two cases also missing busy tra<U+FB03>c data),
resulting in the total of 1081 cases in Models 1b (child tra<U+FB03>c safety)
and 3 (<U+FB01>nal model). Model convergence was achieved for all models. In
the model building process, all objectively measured child and school
variables except length of high tra<U+FB03>c roads (p = 0.533) and school
walkability (p = 0.129) reached the signi<U+FB01>cance level at p < 0.1 in
omnibus F tests (Appendix C). Ten variables were therefore included in
the <U+FB01>nal model where results were fully adjusted (Fig. 2 and Appendix
D as a table format). The robustness of the estimates in the <U+FB01>nal model
was demonstrated through sensitivity analyses where model <U+FB01>t (i.e.,
AIC, BIC) in the <U+FB01>nal model was better than that in models with a
neighbourhood random intercept or all variables (including high tra<U+FB03>c
exposure and school walkability) (Appendix E). There was evidence of
variation in the random intercepts, implying di<U+FB00>erences in patters of
school travel mode between schools. The variance between schools was
similar for active travel compared to car (estimated variance of school
intercepts: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.25–1.90 for walk versus car; 0.67, 95% CI:
0.16–2.87 for wheel versus car), but a greater estimated variance was

observed for public transport compared to car (2.19, 95% CI:
0.66–7.22). Children who actively travelled to school were less likely to
report busy tra<U+FB03>c around schools compared with those driven to school
(walk: p = 0.013, wheel: p = 0.001) in which the probability of cycling/scootering/skateboarding 
(compared to being driven) had a negative 
association with the perception of busy tra<U+FB03>c around school.
Awareness of parked cars was lower among children driven to school
than those using active travel modes. Students from mid-decile school
communities were less likely to cycle/scooter/skateboard to school
than those in high-decile neighbourhoods (p = 0.024). Students from
schools in most deprived neighbourhoods had lower odds (versus those
in high-decile schools) of using public transport rather than cars
(p = 0.047). The ratio of cycle lane to all road length was negatively
associated with cycling/scootering/skateboarding to school. Students
from the schools with a higher ratio of number of tra<U+FB03>c lights around
were more likely to use bike/scooter/skateboard to school; whereas
those from the schools with a lower rate of tra<U+FB03>c lights tended to travel
more by public transport than by cars.

4. Discussion

The overall aim of this research was to provide a comprehensive
understanding of how school policies and practices supported or inhibited 
school travel behaviour in the context of Auckland, New
Zealand. Using multiphase mixed methods, three approaches were
undertaken to achieve this aim. Firstly, an overarching theme, sub-
themes and categories were generated from school principal/representative 
interviews about school travel policies, practices and
tra<U+FB03>c around school. Secondly, the overarching theme, sub-themes and
categories were contextualised using corresponding objectively-measured 
child and school variables to develop quantitative modelling.
Thirdly, quantitative modelling was undertaken to identify associations
between school travel behaviour and objectively measured child and
school variables.
Thematic analysis revealed that all schools had speci<U+FB01>c policies,

procedures and programmes of school travel behaviour that were primarily 
designed to ensure student’s safety. Resources such as the
Travelwise programme, pedestrian crossings to control tra<U+FB03>c around
school and road safety education were collaboratively supplied by
Auckland Council, Auckland Transport, New Zealand Police and other
organisations. Consistent with these qualitative <U+FB01>ndings, results from
mixed e<U+FB00>ects multinomial logistic regression models indicated signi<U+FB01>cant 
associations between school travel behaviour and the emergent
overarching theme and sub-themes of safety, walking and cycling infrastructure 
and pedestrian crossing. Those cycling, scootering or skateboarding 
to school were more aware of parked cars. Active travellers
were likely to perceive their immediate school environment to have
lower levels of busy tra<U+FB03>c than those chau<U+FB00>eured to school. The
probability of cycling, scootering and skateboarding (versus being
driven) was negatively associated with a ratio of length of cycle lanes to
all roads, and positively associated with a higher ratio of tra<U+FB03>c lights.
The quantitative modelling also shed light on di<U+FB00>erences in school
travel behaviour by child and school sociodemographic characteristics.
Compared to intermediate school-aged children, primary school-aged
children were less likely to use public transport than car. The odds of
active travelling to school were higher in boys than girls. The results
from this study were consistent with nationally representative data
where the prevalence of active travel was higher in older children and
boys than the counterparts (46.3% (boys) versus 42.6% (girls) in the
New Zealand Health Survey; 36% (ages 5–7) versus 49% (ages 12–14)
in the Active New Zealand Youth Survey) (Smith et al., 2019b). There
was a higher likelihood of cycling, scootering, skateboarding and public
transport use than car travel in children attending high-decile schools.

4.1. Associates of how children perceived tra<U+FB03>c safety

Interestingly, children who actively travel to school were less likely
to perceive busy tra<U+FB03>c but more likely to report parked cars around
schools than those driven to school, as indicated in the quantitative
data. Coupling with the overarching safety theme, these <U+FB01>ndings imply

perceptions of tra<U+FB03>c safety in relation to school travel mode may be
behaviour- and context-speci<U+FB01>c. For example, children who were driven
to school might have more sensitivity to motorised tra<U+FB03>c conditions
because they experienced more tra<U+FB03>c congestion than those who actively 
travelled to school (Egli et al., 2019). In active travellers, tra<U+FB03>c
danger might be experienced mostly at pedestrian crossings and around
drop-o<U+FB00>/pick-up areas where a concentration of cars roamed and
parked, as identi<U+FB01>ed in the qualitative data. In this respect, school
patrols might have played a vital role in improving tra<U+FB03>c safety at
pedestrian crossings, which subsequently lowered the level of busy
tra<U+FB03>c perceptions around school. Moreover, tra<U+FB03>c safety perceptions
are in<U+FB02>uenced by not only the volume and speed of tra<U+FB03>c but also other
elements such as public surveillance of the setting (Egli et al., 2018).
The current quantitative modelling did not show an association between 
GIS-derived objective measures of tra<U+FB03>c volume and speed within
the immediate school environment (i.e., length of high and low tra<U+FB03>c
roads within an 800 m bu<U+FB00>er around school) and school travel behaviour. 
These measures were based on the road classi<U+FB01>cation which
might not re<U+FB02>ect the actual <U+FB02>ow of tra<U+FB03>c (e.g., tra<U+FB03>c congestion)
during the morning rush hour. This limitation demonstrates the importance 
of capturing both objective and subjective perspectives of
safety of tra<U+FB03>c environments. For instance, children living in San
Diego, USA perceived busy commercial areas with more tra<U+FB03>c as safer
walking environments than quiet and remote residential roads with less
tra<U+FB03>c (Jamme et al., 2018; McGrath et al., 2016). Further qualitative
research to investigate what and which settings are perceived as facilitators 
or barriers to tra<U+FB03>c safety with which travel mode may be required 
to develop quantitative data. Information about behaviour- and
context-speci<U+FB01>c tra<U+FB03>c safety can contribute to the development of
measurement which can speci<U+FB01>cally and sensitively assess tra<U+FB03>c safety
for school travel behaviour.

4.2. Built environments acting as facilitators or barriers to school travel
behaviour

An inverse relationship between objectively measured cycle lanes
and active school travel behaviour appears counter-intuitive at <U+FB01>rst.
However, this <U+FB01>nding was somewhat expected based on previous

examinations of cycle lane availability and quality in relation to parent
neighbourhood environment perspectives in Auckland (Smith et al.,
2019a). These <U+FB01>ndings suggest that cycle lanes, compared to cycle
paths (i.e., segregated tracks/trails for cyclists and/or pedestrians), in
the Auckland context might not be designated for children to safely
cycle, scooter or skateboard on. In fact, it has been suggested that cycle
lanes are suitable for ‘enthused and con<U+FB01>dent’ cyclists (NZ Transport
Agency, 2019), rather than young, school-aged children. Cycle lanes
are, however, more commonly constructed than cycle paths in Auckland 
(Auckland Transport, 2019b). According to New Zealand law, bicycles
with wheels larger than 355 mm diameter (e.g., a tricycle or
small child’s bicycle) are not allowed to be ridden on footpaths,
whereas scooters and skateboards are legally allowed on the footpath
regardless of their wheel size (NZ Transport Agency, 2017). The New
Zealand Police recommend that children under the age of 10 years
should not cycle on the road without supervision despite no legality
regarding the minimum age of cycling on the road (New Zealand Police,
2019). Correspondingly, the New Zealand Transport Agency advises
that being over the age of 11 years may be appropriate for children to
cycle on the road unsupervised (NZ Transport Agency, 2013). Under
these circumstances, children and parents need to make the ultimate
decision about how to cycle to school or other destinations: either
breaking the law by cycling on the footpath, or taking the risk of using
the cycle lane adjacent to high volume vehicles (particularly during the
morning rush hour) (Randal et al., 2018). Children, especially younger
children may often use a safe footpath rather than an unsafe ‘painted
strip on a road’. Given the impact of built environment changes (e.g.,
new infrastructure for walking and cycling) on people’s perceptions and
behaviour (Panter and Ogilvie, 2015; Prins et al., 2016), investment
and improvement in dedicated cycling infrastructure (e.g., Cambridge
Cycling Campaign (2014)) may be a potential solution to this problem.
The ratio of number of tra<U+FB03>c lights (controlled intersections) to the
immediate area around school was positively associated with higher
odds of cycling/scootering/skateboarding than being driven, indicating
a need for signalised crossings (i.e., crossings controlled by tra<U+FB03>c
lights) for children to travel to school by wheeled modes. In the interviews 
with school principals and representatives, however, pedestrian
crossings did not always refer to signal crossings but zebra crossings
and other crossings (without tra<U+FB03>c lights; where school patrols were
arranged) (Fig. 3). Larouche and colleagues (2014a) reported the presence 
of crossing guards (i.e., school patrols) was positively associated
with active school travel. In New Zealand, GIS data sources for the
zebra and other crossings were not available at the time of this study.
Therefore, in light of data availability, the pedestrian crossing sub-theme
was limited to signal crossings (at tra<U+FB03>c lights) and school sta<U+FB00> accounts. 
Latest remote sensing techniques may be a potential method to
capture di<U+FB00>erent types of pedestrian crossings using aerial imagery
(Hua et al., 2019). These advances in measurement of tra<U+FB03>c safety and
built environments can bene<U+FB01>t the evaluation of interventions such as
Travelwise programmes.

4.3. Safe environments for children’s active school travel

The Safe School Travel Plans (part of the wider Travelwise programme) 
integrate multiple strategies of engineering, education, enforcement, 
encouragement and policy into an action plan to promote
active school travel (Hinckson and Badland, 2011; Hinckson et al.,
2011). This multidisciplinary scheme was acknowledged by participating 
school principals and representatives under the sub-themes of
policy, procedure and programme, pedestrian crossing, walking and cycling
infrastructure and education (Fig. 1). The Canadian site of the International 
Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment
(ISOCOLE) also showed an interaction e<U+FB00>ect for Safe Routes to School
programme and tra<U+FB03>c calming (i.e., speed bumps, narrower lanes) to
facilitate active school travel (Larouche et al., 2014a). A pivotal role of
community settings beyond the immediate school environment was

highlighted in which positive community culture, neighbourhood social
interactions and relationships between school and community can reinforce 
active school travel (Hawley et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020).
Auckland Transport recently put forward their Safer Communities
programme in the Auckland Regional Land Transport Plan 2018–2028
wherein consolidated (e.g., creating and improving streets and footpaths 
for active travellers, supporting safer driving behaviours) and
community-based approaches were encompassed (Auckland Transport,
2018a, b). Aligned with the C-STBM (Ikeda et al., 2019) and the World
Health Organization’s guiding principles of creating active societies,
environments (World Health Organization, 2018), people and systems
through all levels from upstream (i.e., social and environmental factors)
to downstream (i.e., individual factors), this multifaceted approach may
be key to creating safe environments and promoting active school
travel.

4.4. Need for equitable opportunities of school travel behaviour

Our <U+FB01>ndings drew some attention to the issue of inequity (i.e., unfair 
disparities derived from social, cultural, economic and environmental 
conditions that can be improved upon by human action) (World
Health Organization, 2018). Signi<U+FB01>cantly lower odds of wheeling or
public transport in children from low-to-mid-decile schools may indicate 
that children living in communities of higher deprivation might
not have su<U+FB03>cient access to these modes of travel. Along with school
attitudes towards discouraging students to cycle to school, the accessibility 
and a<U+FB00>ordability of bike, scooter, skateboard and public transportation 
need to be taken into account to promote such travel modes.
The Bike On New Zealand Charitable Trust implemented the Bikes in
Schools programme in which primary schools purchase a package of
bikes, helmets, tracks, bike storage and cycle skills training cost-e<U+FB00>ectively 
to promote cycling in children (Bike On New Zealand Charitable
Trust, 2019). Schools are liable to secure funders to cover the cost of
equipment (e.g., approximately NZ$60,000 for an average school of
300 students) and ongoing maintenance (approximately NZ$3,000)
(Bike On New Zealand Charitable Trust, 2019). The programme, however, 
is not speci<U+FB01>cally designed to support low-to-mid-decile schools.
Auckland Transport has delivered the Bike Safe training for years 5
and 6 students (ages 9–11 years) in primary schools since 2010 to
improve their cycle skills. Although the training can provide equal
opportunities for students across high-to-low decile schools to improve
their skills as well as self-e<U+FB03>cacy of cycling, the issue of inequities of
access to a bike (or scooter or skateboard) has still remained. Recently
Auckland Council proposed a new NZ$1.1 million initiative to support
public transport wherein free public transport (including buses, trains
and ferries) has been available on weekends for all children under
16 years since September 2019 (Wilson, 2019). This initiative also
potentially provides equal opportunities for children to build up their
experience, skills and con<U+FB01>dence of using the service, which can subsequently 
lead to a rise in the use of public transport in this population
(Goodman et al., 2014). Notwithstanding, an issue still exists in terms of
the a<U+FB00>ordability of using public transport to travel to/from school on
weekdays particularly for those from low socioeconomic status families.
The current study did not di<U+FB00>erentiate school buses (fare/no fare) from
public buses (fare). Further research may be required to investigate the
in<U+FB02>uence of di<U+FB00>erent types of public transport services (e.g., school bus
versus public bus) on school travel behaviour. The supply of subsidised
school buses targeting at low-to-mid-decile schools may reduce inequities 
of access to public transport particularly for bus users (Wilson
et al., 2010).
The prevalence of the Travelwise programme in the schools in the
current study (75.2%) was equivalent to programme coverage for all
Auckland school-aged children (75%) (Auckland Transport, 2019a).
However, the level of engagement in the programme varied by school:
from a lower level of commitment (“We have been in the Travelwise
group but really there’s not a lot to do here.”) to a higher level of

commitment (“We have a gold [award]” (i.e., ‘gold’ is the highest
award of the programme given to schools that made signi<U+FB01>cant contribution 
to reduction in car travel and tra<U+FB03>c congestion as well as
improvement in road safety)). To <U+FB01>ll this gap, Auckland Transport
shifted their focus and e<U+FB00>orts from recruiting all schools (quantityfocus) 
to developing a comprehensive approach to support school
communities with greatest need (quality-focus), which may mitigate
the inequity of active school travel (Auckland Transport, 2015). This
approach, particularly in the process of selecting school communities,
may need to cautiously consider the balance of social and environmental 
needs – for instance, a focus of reducing environmental inequities 
(e.g., in rural schools) may exacerbate social inequities further
(e.g., rural communities with high socioeconomic status).

4.5. Understanding of the role of school policies and practices in school
travel behaviour

This study addressed the important role of school policies and
practices that may facilitate or hinder children’s school travel behaviour. 
For example, robust Travelwise programmes, school patrol procedure, 
and active school travel rules may facilitate children’s active
school travel; however, lenient school zone policy (e.g., allowing children 
living outside the school zone to enrol at the school) and drop-o<U+FB00>
and pick-up procedure (e.g., allowing parents to drive in the school site)
may hinder this behaviour. In fact, school enrolment schemes in New
Zealand tend to act as ‘guidelines’, and parents are likely to choose their
children’s schools based on school quality and reputation rather than
proximity (Ministry of Education, 2017; Morton et al., 2018). Fig. 4
outlines speci<U+FB01>c relationships between the sub-themes of school policy,
procedure and programme and the overarching and other sub-themes
based on the thematic map (Fig. 1). Each sub-theme of the school policies, 
procedures and programmes were distinctively, but to some extent 
similarly, interrelated with the overarching and other sub-themes.
One of the fundamental ingredients of these example associations was a
multidisciplinary team who can provide school support for active
school travel. Each association may work independently, but interactive
and collective bene<U+FB01>ts may be produced by applying more than one
association.
Children’s school travel behaviour may be associated with the environment 
beyond the school settings (e.g., route environment (Ikeda
et al., 2018b)). As Ikeda and colleagues (2019) elucidated, the role of
school environment is one of seven domains that had direct and indirect
associations with school travel behaviour. Given the integral role of the
other six domains (i.e., built environment, social environment, household 
characteristics, household beliefs, child characteristics, child beliefs) 
in school travel behaviour, a holistic approach including environmental 
(school, social, built), household and child factors may be
needed to support changes in school travel behaviour from passive to
active travel.

5. Strengths and limitations

This study employed multiphase mixed methods to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of how school policies and practices supported 
and inhibited school travel behaviour. To our knowledge, this is
the <U+FB01>rst study to integrate <U+FB01>ndings from (1) interviews with school
principals or representatives about school policy and practices related
to school travel behaviour and (2) mixed e<U+FB00>ects multinomial logistic
regression models using objectively measured child and school variables. 
The mixed methods allowed us to triangulate qualitative and
quantitative <U+FB01>ndings, which led to in-depth interpretation of the overall
<U+FB01>ndings.
Despite these strengths, this study was cross-sectional and conducted 
in only the urbanised Auckland region in New Zealand; therefore, 
<U+FB01>ndings cannot be generalised to other school environments and
causality cannot be inferred. Due to a small sample size of the wheel

group (7.6%), particular comparisons with this group may lack statistical power.
GIS-derived built environment measures were calculated                   
within the immediate school environment de<U+FB01>ned as 800 m pedestrian                    
network bu<U+FB00>er around school. To minimise exposure misclassi<U+FB01>cation                    
(Pannucci and Wilkins, 2010), the bu<U+FB00>er size was cautiously (rather                   
than arbitrarily) determined based on the median distance of participating 
children who actively travelled to school (Ikeda et al., 2018b)                
and previous studies (around school (e.g., Braza et al. (2004)), around               
home (e.g., Panter et al. (2010)). Furthermore, school entrance locations 
(points) were manually identi<U+FB01>ed by the <U+FB01>rst author (EI) during                 
the data collection, and the school site (polygon) was delineated using               
the points of access to the school (rather than single centroid) (Harrison            
et al., 2014; Ikeda et al., 2018b). The size/area of school zones                     
(nzschools.tki.org.nz) were also visually inspected. No patterns were                 
observed in terms of school decile but school type (where intermediate                
schools tended to have bigger school zones than primary schools).                     
Nevertheless, the issues of spatial scale and zoning (i.e., modi<U+FB01>able area
unit problem) as well as spatial and temporal uncertainty relating to

6. Conclusions 
                    
Road tra<U+FB03>c safety for children was the primary goal of school policy   
and practices related to school travel behaviour in Auckland, New                     
Zealand. To facilitate active school travel, it is essential for schools to           

deliver road safety education and skills training, to have secure crossings 
and other walking and cycling infrastructure, and for tra<U+FB03>c to be
controlled around the school. The implementation of school policies,
procedures and programmes including the Travelwise programme was
predominantly supported by national and regional governments, local
councils and school communities. Nevertheless, further support from
these partners may be required to provide equitable opportunities to
travel to school by bike and public transport (including school buses)
for children with low-to-mid socioeconomic status in New Zealand.
Future research is needed to develop behaviour- and context-speci<U+FB01>c
measures of tra<U+FB03>c safety perception and the built environment around
school for use in school travel behaviour. Overall, this study has demonstrated 
the important role of school policy and procedures in relation 
to school travel behaviour and provided recommendations for
future interventions to use an intersectoral approach to support changes
in school travel behaviour.
