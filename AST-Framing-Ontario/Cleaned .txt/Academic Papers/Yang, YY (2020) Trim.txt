the present study, we assessed different dimensions of urban greenery using three measures: number of parks;
the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) based on satellite imagery; and street greenness based on
Google Street View images. Multilevel regression analysis and structural equation modeling were conducted to
investigate the complex relationships among urban greenery, AST, and body weight for 1,148 primary school
students in Hong Kong. Overall, children attending schools with greener surrounding areas were more likely to
engage in AST and had lower body mass index (BMI). In addition, AST partially mediated the impact of urban
greenery on BMI. The findings demonstrate the importance of greenery around schools for children’s body
weight status. They also offer public health and planning guidance on how to address overweight and obesity
problems among children.

Y. Yang, et al.
Locke et al., 2001). A review focused on the relationship between AST
and physical activity and body weight has shown that children walking
or cycling to school had higher level of overall physical activity com-
pared with those who travel to school in passive modes (Faulkner et al.,
2009). Empirical studies found the proportions of children meeting
physical activity guidelines significantly differed by school transporta-
tion modes. Measured by accelerometers, active school commuters ex-
hibited higher overall physical activity levels per hour (Cooper et al.,
2003; Sirard et al., 2005), or more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity per day, than passive commuters (Alexander et al.,
2005; Faulkner et al., 2009; Kek et al., 2019; Sirard et al., 2005). In
Ireland, Cyprus and Canada, children who walked to school sig-
nificantly exhibited higher step counts during the before school period,
the after school period and the whole day compared to children who
used motorized transportation mode (Elaine and Marie, 2011;
Loucaides and Jago, 2008; Pabayo et al., 2012). Researchers also found
evidence that primary school boys who walked or cycled to school were
significantly more physically active than those traveling by car, while
girls who walked but not cycled to school were significantly associated
with higher daily physical activity levels (Cooper et al., 2005). AST is
also well placed to address inequalities in physical activity participation
in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic status (Brainard et al.,
2019; Mandic et al., 2015; Stark et al., 2018). Thus, AST has the po-
tential to make a substantial contribution to children’s daily overall
physical activity (Pate et al., 2016). However, AST has declined dra-
matically in various contexts, including Australia, the United States, the
United Kingdom, and Hong Kong. In the United States, nearly half
(49%) of children aged 5 to 14 actively traveled to school in 1969 but in
2009, the rate had dropped to 13% (McDonald et al., 2011). In Hong
Kong, the rate of AST also dropped from 40% to 29% over the last
several decades (Census & Statistics Department of Hong Kong, 2016).
Children’s levels of physical activity are highly volatile and may be
influenced by a multitude of factors, including physiological, psycho-
logical, sociocultural, and environmental determinants (Almanza et al.,
2012; Duncan et al., 2014; Goran et al., 1999; Lovasi et al., 2011). Their
level of physical activity is associated with numerous built environment
factors (Saelens et al., 2003), such as land use mix (Aytur et al., 2008;
Frank et al., 2004; Saelens et al., 2003), urban density (Saelens et al.,
2003; Schlossberg et al., 2006), and street connectivity (Larsen et al.,
2009; Saelens et al., 2003). However, evidence for the built environ-
ment determinants of AST remains mixed. In a recent study conducted
in New Zealand with 2,840 participants, AST was positively associated
with intersection density (1 km buffer) and negatively related to
dwelling density (1 km buffer) and distance to school (Ikeda et al.,
2018). Distance between home and school is regarded as one of the
most consistent correlates of AST, with long distance as one of the
greatest barriers (Chica-Olmo et al., 2018; Mandic et al., 2017;
Rothman et al., 2018). In the ultra-dense metropolis of Hong Kong,
most districts are highly self-contained and children usually attend










Travel Behaviour and Society 20 (2020) 104–113
schools close to their housing estates, which may facilitate AST (Census
& Statistics Department of Hong Kong, 2011).
Among the relevant built environment factors, the relationship be-
tween urban greenery and physical activity has received increasing
research attention because rapid urbanization is reducing people’s op-
portunities to contact with nature (Gubbels et al., 2016; Hunter et al.,
2015; Lu, 2018a; Mårtensson et al., 2014). A study conducted in the
United States found that children living in areas with more street trees
were more physically active (Lovasi et al., 2011). In another study of
208 children, which used the normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI) as an objective measure of urban greenery from satellite ima-
gery, researchers found that greenness exposure was positively asso-
ciated with the odds of engaging in moderate to vigorous physical ac-
tivity (Almanza et al., 2012). Another study demonstrated that
children’s green space exposure was positively linked to their physical
activity (James et al., 2015). Specifically, researchers also found a
significantly positive association between the likelihood of conducting
AST and the presence of street trees and parks, good maintenance of
green spaces, and absence of litter (Larsen et al., 2009; Van Kann et al.,
2014).
Yet, findings regarding the association between urban greenery and
body weight status for children are mixed. A systematic review focusing
on urban greenness, physical activity, and body weight found fairly
strong evidence of a positive association between greenness and phy-
sical activity and a less consistent negative association between
greenness and body weight (James et al., 2015). One group of re-
searchers found that greenness was significantly associated with a de-
creased risk of overweight among children in high-density areas, but
not in low-density counterparts (Liu et al., 2007). Another study found
that street tree density, but not park area, was associated with a lower
obesity prevalence level among children (Lovasi et al., 2013). Some
researchers have argued that these inconsistent results are due to the
use of different measures of urban greenery (de Vries et al., 2013; Fan
et al., 2011; Picavet et al., 2016). Recent studies have indicated that
perceived greenness plays a more significant role than overall objec-
tively measured greenness in daily physical activity and body weight
status (Bai et al., 2013; de Jong et al., 2012; Hipp et al., 2016). To this
end, in this study, we used three methods to measure urban greenery
near children’s home and school: the number of parks, the NDVI, and
street greenness (extracted from Google Street View (GSV) images). The
measure of eye-level street greenery can effectively capture residents’
daily exposure to greenness and has been applied in recent public
health studies (Lu, 2018b).

To address this research gap, we constructed a conceptual frame-
work for modeling the effects of urban greenery on body weight status
(Fig. 1). As supported by strong evidence, the exposure to urban

Among other built environment factors, the street connectivity of
the school, which was defined as the density of street intersections
within the school’s surrounding area, was positively associated with the
odds of engaging in AST with both buffers (OR [95% CI]: 1.08 [1.01,

parks). Other built environment factors were not significantly asso-
ciated with BMI.

4.2. Results of structural equation modeling

The results of the fitting test suggest that the SEM established in the
present study (presented in Fig. 2) was an ideal research model, with
high agreement and stability through the matching degree analysis.
The model was constructed and analyzed using the statistical soft-


ware package AMOS 21.0 (IBM, USA). It had a high degree of model
fitness, as indicated in Table 6 and Fig. 3.
The results of the SEM path analysis suggest that three hypotheses

(H3, H4, and H5) were verified (C.R. > 1.96, p < 0.05). Urban
greenery surrounding school had a significant effect on both AST and
BMI, confirming H3 and H4. AST also had a significant effect on body

weight, confirming H5. However, urban greenery surrounding re-


sidence has no significant effect on AST or body weight (p > 0.05),
refuting H1 and H2. The direct effect of urban greenery surrounding
school on body weight was 0.43, while the indirect effect with the
mediation of AST was 0.08 (Fig. 4 and Table 7). The total effect of

urban greenery surrounding school on body weight (direct effect + in-

direct effect) was 0.51.

5. Discussion
In this study, we examined the associations between urban built
environment factors, AST, and body weight for 1,148 primary school
students in Hong Kong. As suggested in the literature, uncertainty about
the effects of urban greenery on physical activity and health stems
partially from the use of different measures of urban greenery. Hence,
we assessed different dimensions of urban greenery using three mea-
sures: the number of parks, the NDVI (by satellite imagery), and street
greenness (by GSV images). Street greenness represents the eye-level
greenness perceived by school commuters on streets and therefore can
objectively estimate the daily greenery exposure of urban residents. We
further applied SEM to examine the mediation effects of AST between
urban greenery and weight status.

and have a lower BMI. Furthermore, we supplement previous studies by
providing strong and positive evidence of the association of urban
greenery and the BMI of children (Lovasi et al., 2013). Our results
emphasize the role of urban greenery surrounding a school on AST and
BMI, whereas other studies have typically emphasized the role of urban
greenery near residential neighborhoods. This difference may stem
from our sampling methods and research design. We carefully selected
participants from primary schools with different built environment
characteristics, while other studies have selected participants based on
their dwelling locations. Hence, we observed greater variation in urban
greenery surrounding a school than in other studies.
Understanding how AST mediates the effect of urban greenery on
health is of paramount importance to develop effective interventions to
improve children’s body weight outcomes. Previous studies have pro-
vided strong evidence of the direct effect of urban greenery on body
weight and BMI (Bell et al., 2008; Duncan et al., 2014). However, the
indirect effect of urban greenery on body weight and BMI via AST has
not been explored. We conducted SEM to understand the complex re-
lationships among urban greenery, AST, and BMI. Our findings suggest
that urban greenery directly affects body weight and also indirectly
affects body weight via AST. The findings of this study echo others
(Almanza et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2008) in stressing the importance of
urban greenness for promoting AST and preventing childhood over-
weight and obesity. Our findings are analogous to those of a previous
study among adults, which reported that urban greenery directly in-
fluences physical health and also indirectly affects it through physical
activity (Zhang et al., 2018). Hence, the direct effect of urban greenery
on health and its indirect effect via physical activity can be regarded as
reasonably robust and may be applicable across age groups.

GSV images, but not by the NDVI, was found to have a positive effect on
AST and BMI. As we mentioned in Section 1, inconsistent results of
studies on the association between urban greenness and body weight
status may be due to the different measures of urban greenery, and the
results of our study also support this argument. It is plausible that street
greenness and the NDVI capture different dimensions of urban
greenery, given that the former focuses on eye-level greenness and the
latter focuses on the overall greenery in an area. Street greenness may
better estimate daily greenery exposure because it better represents
what a resident perceives and streets are used more than other areas
(Lu, 2018b). The superior performance of street greenness over the
NDVI is also consistent with the previous finding that perceived
greenness has a stronger impact on people’s health and physical activity
than overall greenness, as measured by the NDVI (Leslie et al., 2010;
Sugiyama et al., 2008).
Previous studies have reported correlations between AST and body
weight and other built environment factors, such as urban density,
street connectivity, and distance between school and residence (Duncan
et al., 2014; Faulkner et al., 2009; Mitchell, 2013). In contrast, we
found only one such association (between AST and body weight and
street connectivity). This difference may be accounted for by differ-
ences in urban contexts (Lu et al., 2019). For example, Hong Kong has a
much higher urban density than the Western cities in which most
previous studies were conducted. Understanding the different contexts
of the social and built environments could aid in developing localized
public health and planning policy for children.
5.2. Policy implications

The findings of our study demonstrate the importance of urban
greenery, especially around schools, in promoting children’s AST be-
havior and improving their body weight status. These findings have
important implications for policymakers, health promoters, and urban
planners and designers. Government agencies should consider estab-
lishing targeted policy plans to promote children’s health by creating
new greenspaces or improving existing greenspaces around schools.
More specifically, future planning and design of urban greenspaces
should shift from an exclusive focus on the size or the number of
greenspaces to the practice considering the accessibility and visibility of
those greenspaces, so they can be easily perceived by children in their
daily lives. This is particularly critical for high-density cities, such as
Hong Kong, where land supply is limited and greenspaces in built-up
areas are scarce.

5.3. Strengths and limitations
One strength of this study is that we assessed urban greenery using
three methods. The simultaneous use of three urban greenery methods
may help us to distinguish which aspects of urban greenery are of
particular importance for children’s AST behaviors and body weight
status. The other strength is the use of SEM to explore the direct effect

of urban greenery on body weight status and the indirect effect via AST.
This advanced statistical technique helped us to understand the re-
lationships between urban greenery, AST, and body weight. However,
we could not infer any causal relationships because of the cross-sec-
tional research design. Future studies could use natural experiments to
deliver more robust scientific evidence. We also used questionnaires to
assess AST, which may be subject to recall bias or social desirability
bias. In future studies, school travel behaviors could be collected by
portable GPS and/or accelerometer equipment for more objective
measures (Li et al., 2019).

6. Conclusion

Using three urban greenery measures (number of parks, NDVI, and
street greenery with GSV images), we found that street greenery in the
area surrounding a school was significantly associated with children’s
AST behaviors and body weight status. AST was also found to play a
mediating role in the relationship between urban greenery and the body
weight status of children. The findings of this study join others in
highlighting the importance of greenery exposure around schools in
promoting AST and improving body weight status among children.
Future planning and design practice should consider the visibility of
greenspaces as well as more traditional planning parameters such as the
size or number of greenspaces.
