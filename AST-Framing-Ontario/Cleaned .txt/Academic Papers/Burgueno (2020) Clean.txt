Perceived Autonomy Support Scale for Active Commuting to and from
School (PASS-ACS) in children and adolescents

abstract
This research aimed to adapt the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ Spanish versions of the Perceived Autonomy
Support Scale for Exercise Settings to the active commuting to and from school context (Perceived Autonomy
Support Scale for Active Commuting to and from School, PASS-ACS) among children and adolescents. In Study 1
(n = 236 students), a four-item one-factor solution of the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-AC
was identi<U+FB01>ed through an exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2 (n = 712 students), con<U+FB01>rmatory factor
analyses veri<U+FB01>ed the structure and reliability of the four-item one-factor solution in the teachers’, parents’, an
peers’ version of the PASS-ACS, which remained invariant across gender. The structural equation modeling
provided evidence for the predictive validity as its results supported the self-determination theory tenets. The
PASS-ACS is the <U+FB01>rst valid and reliable measure to assess students' perceptions of autonomy support for active
commuting to and from school from teachers, parents, and peers.


1. Introduction                                                                                   
												
Although health bene<U+FB01>ts associated with daily physical activity for                          
children and adolescents are widely known (Wu et al., 2017), there is a                           
large body of evidence documenting that the majority of young people                              
do not meet physical activity recommendations (i.e. at least 60 min of                            
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily) (World Health                                       
Organization, 2017). Active commuting to and from school (ACS) not                                
only contributes to meet youth physical activity recommendations                                  
(Martin et al., 2016), but also plays a key role in the physical, psychological, 
cognitive, social, and economic domains of well-being                                 
among young people (Waygood et al., 2017). However, a drastic decline 
of the rate of ACS among children and adolescents has been found                            
in the last years (Chillón et al., 2013). In order to design and implement                        
active commuting interventions to promote walking and cycling as
active modes of commuting to and from school, there is a need to                                      
identify the main determinants and correlates grounded in theoretical                             
frameworks. From a behavioral point of view of school transportation     

(Mitra, 2013), the decision to adopt a particular mode of commuting to
and from school would be likely in<U+FB02>uenced by a variety of external (e.g.
policy), individual (e.g. motivation, attitudes, beliefs), household (e.g.
household composition, access to private automobiles, social and economic 
status), urban environmental (e.g. urban spatial space, neighborhood 
built environment), and social environmental (e.g. parental or
peer support) factors. As parents and other school community agents
may play a key role in e<U+FB00>ectively promoting children’s and adolescents’
ACS (Mandic et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2014; Simons et al., 2013), further
research based on theoretical frameworks such as self-determination
theory (SDT; Ryan and Deci, 2017, 2019) is required.
1.1. Self-determination theory as a theoretical framework to analyze and
measure autonomy support for active commuting to and from school
SDT is a prominent theoretical framework that has been widely used
to understand the social and individual factors in<U+FB02>uencing human behavior 
and well-being in di<U+FB00>erent contexts. Consistent with its
                         
theoretical tenets (Ryan and Deci, 2017, 2019; Vallerand and Lalande,
2011), socio-contextual factors, such as autonomy support, which is
based on promotion of self-initiative, opportunity to choose, independent 
problem-solving skills, and participation in the decision-making 
process, may in<U+FB02>uence motivation via satisfaction of the basic
psychological needs (BPN). Speci<U+FB01>cally, SDT establishes the existence
of three BPN: autonomy, which represents the desire to experience
ownership of one’s actions; competence, which re<U+FB02>ects the desire to
e<U+FB00>ectively interact with the one’s environment; and relatedness, which
symbolizes the desire to be meaningfully connected and integrated with
others. In this line, previous studies in di<U+FB00>erent school physical activity
settings showed that perceived autonomy support from di<U+FB00>erent social
agents (i.e. teachers, parents, or peers) was positively related to BPN
satisfaction, which, in turn, was positively associated with autonomous
motivation and physical activity levels (Gonzalez-Cutre et al., 2014;
Hagger et al., 2009; Sevil-Serrano et al., 2018).
Despite the importance attributed to social support in promoting
ACS among the school population (Mandic et al., 2015; Silva et al.,
2014; Simons et al., 2013), there are no valid and reliable instruments
grounded in SDT to date that measure students’ perceptions of autonomy 
support for ACS from di<U+FB00>erent social agents. This lack of instruments 
has partly limited the understanding of the motivational
processes involving ACS behavior using the SDT framework. Moreover,
the e<U+FB00>ects of multicomponent school-based interventions on students’
perception of autonomy support for ACS provided by di<U+FB00>erent social
agents of the school community could not be measured.
Previous research has pointed out that the Perceived Autonomy
Support Scale for Exercise Settings (PASSES) is a valid and reliable scale
to assess students’ perceptions of autonomy support for physical activity
from physical education teachers, parents, and peers (Hagger et al.,
2007). This instrument consists of a 12-item one-factor model, which
obtained good <U+FB01>t indices in the factor analysis along with an adequate
internal consistency and temporal stability for the teachers’, parents’,
and peers’ versions. Additionally, evidence for cross-cultural invariance
was provided among di<U+FB00>erent populations and contexts (Hagger et al.,
2007). The PASSES has also been validated in the Spanish context to
measure physical education teachers’ (Moreno-Murcia et al., 2008),
parents’, and peers’ (Gonzalez-Cutre et al., 2014) autonomy support for
physical activity. These studies in the Spanish context o<U+FB00>ered psychometric 
support for the 12-item one-factor model in terms of internal
structure validity, predictive validity, internal consistency, and temporal stability.
The PASSES should be adapted to other forms of physical activity
such as ACS for several reasons. Firstly, walking (one of the most usual
modes of school transportation) has been identi<U+FB01>ed as the most natural
form of physical activity and it has peculiar characteristics that should
be considered. It does not require speci<U+FB01>c skills, equipment and resources 
or economic cost compared with other activities or sports.
Secondly, the prevalence of physical activity and ACS is di<U+FB00>erent.
Current global trends reveal that four out of <U+FB01>ve adolescents do not
meet physical activity guidelines, while between 40% and 70% of
children commute actively to school (Guthold et al., 2020). Thirdly, the
main determinants and correlates of ACS and physical activity are also
distinct. For example, physical activity is mainly positively related to
self-e<U+FB03>cacy, previous physical activity, and parental support (Martins
et al., 2017), while ACS is mainly positively associated with safety,
walkability, and neighborhood social interactions, and negatively with
distance to school and car ownership (Ikeda et al., 2018). Therefore, the
role of teachers, parents, and peers in these two behaviors (general
physical activity and ACS) may be di<U+FB00>erent. In this regard, parents may
be concerned about their children’s exercise and sport but not about
their children’s active commuting to and from school.

1.2. The current research

This research aimed to adapt the teachers’ (Moreno-Murcia et al.,

2008), parents’, and peers’ Spanish versions (Gonzalez-Cutre et al.,
2014) of the PASSES to the ACS context, and to examine the psychometric 
properties of the resulting version (i.e. Perceived Autonomy
Support Scale for Active Commuting to and from School, PASS-ACS)
among children and adolescents. To accomplish this objective, two
studies were developed with two independent samples of students. In
Study 1, we explored the factor structure of this instrument in the ACS
context. In Study 2, we con<U+FB01>rmed this factor structure, tested the
gender invariance, analyzed the instrument’s reliability and tested the
associations of students’ perceptions of autonomy support with the BPN
satisfaction and intrinsic motivation for ACS (predictive validity).

2. Study 1

The objective of Study 1 was to explore, via an exploratory factor
analysis, the factor composition and structure of the teachers’, parents’,
and peers’ versions developed for the PASS-ACS.

2.1. Materials and method

2.1.1. Participants
The participants were 236 students (117 boys and 119 girls), aged
between 11 and 17 years old (Mage = 13.21, SDage = 1.72), from four
Spanish cities. In particular, 89 were primary school students (45 boys
and 44 girls, Mage = 11.49, SDage = 0.75) and 147 were secondary
school students (72 boys and 75 girls; Mage = 14.17, SDage = 1.31).

2.1.2. Instruments
2.1.2.1. Perceived autonomy support for active commuting to and from
school from teachers, parents, and peers. Primary and secondary school
students’ perceptions of autonomy support for ACS provided by
di<U+FB00>erent agents of the school community (e.g. teachers, parents, and
peers) were measured with the three adapted Spanish versions
(Gonzalez-Cutre et al., 2014; Moreno-Murcia et al., 2008) of the
PASSES (Hagger et al., 2007) to the ACS context. The 12 item-scale
was answered separately by the students for each social agent. The
three versions were preceded respectively by the following statement:
My teachers…/My parents…/My peers… The responses to each item
were collected via a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly
disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).

2.1.3. Procedure
The guidelines proposed by Bartram et al. (2018) were followed in
order to adapt the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ Spanish versions of the
PASSES to the ACS context. To this end, four experts adapted each of
the respective items from the PASSES to the ACS context. For example,
expressions such as “My physical education teacher/peers/parents encourage 
me to do active sports and/or vigorous exercise in my free
time” were replaced by “My teachers/peers/parents encourage me to
walk or cycle to and from school”. Next, three other experts assessed the
content of each item to ensure its understanding and to guarantee that
they were measuring the variable for which they were originally developed. 
It should be noted that the seven experts who participated in
the scale adaptation process were graduates in Exercise and Sport Sci-
ences with a PhD in Sport Sciences. Three of them were experts in the
SDT framework and the other four in ACS and physical activity-related
variables. Subsequently, a pilot study (n = 12) was conducted with
primary and secondary school students in order to verify that there
were no problems with the understanding of the items for each of the
three versions proposed. As a whole, the instrument adaptation process
gathered validity evidence based on content.
Then, primary and secondary schools were selected by convenience
to develop the Study 1. Once school authorization was obtained, the
research group met with the teachers to present the main aim of the
study and to give them the student’s written informed consent to participate 
in this study. The written consent was obtained from each


student prior to data collection as a prerequisite for participation. The
administration of the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of PASS-
ACS was conducted in a classroom setting without the presence of the
teachers. The participation in this study was voluntary and con<U+FB01>dential
in order to comply with all ethical procedures for data collection.
Students who did not complete the full questionnaire were excluded.
This research obtained the approval of the Ethics Committee on Human
Research of the University of Granada (number 162/CEIH/2016).


2.1.4. Data analysis
The robustness to apply an exploratory factor analysis was assessed
by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic, acceptable with values over
0.80 (Lloret-Segura et al., 2014), and the Barlett’s sphericity test. The
exploratory factor analysis was conducted using the principal component
 method together with the varimax orthogonal rotation (Lloret-
Segura et al., 2014). This rotation technique allows minimizing the
small coe<U+FB03>cients and maximizing the large coe<U+FB03>cients in order to
obtain pro<U+FB01>les that can be easily associated with a particular subset of
variables, facilitating the interpretation of the factors obtained (Lloret-
Segura et al., 2014). A pre-established number of factors was not speci<U+FB01>ed to perform this analysis. The interpretation of the items extracted
was conducted following the criterion outlined by Hair, Black, Babin,
and Anderson (2018) (i.e. primary factor loading above 0.50 and secondary 
factor loading below 0.32).



2.2. Results
For the exploratory factor analysis both the KMO statistic and the

Bartlett’s sphericity test showed acceptable values for the teachers’
(KMO = 0.90; <U+03C7>2 [66] = 1496.55, p < .001), parents’ (KMO = 0.93;
<U+03C7>2 [66] = 2113.81, p < .001), and peers’ (KMO = 0.94; <U+03C7>2
[66] = 2243.55, p < .001) versions of the PASS-ACS. Table 1 shows
the descriptive statistics and factor loadings of each of the twelve items

for the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-ACS. Only
items 5, 9, 10, and 12 of the three versions met the psychometric requirements
proposed by Hair et al. (2018). The remaining items did not

comply with these requirements and were removed for further analyses.
2.3. Discussion


The objective of Study 1 was to explore the factor composition and
structure from the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-
ACS. The results derived from each one of the three exploratory factor
analyses resulted in a four-item one-factor solution for the PASS-ACS-

Teachers, PASS-ACS-Parents, and PASS-ACS-Peers. Given that every
latent variable must be represented by at least three or four indicators
(Hair et al., 2018; Kline, 2015; Lloret-Segura et al., 2014), the four-item

one-factor structure was considered to be appropriate and, therefore,
there was no need to reformulate those items that did not show optimal
psychometric properties. Likely, the poor psychometric performance of
these items could be due to the psychological experiences captured by
these items, as either they are not fully representative for students in
the ACS context or they have not been meaningfully perceived by students 
when they commute to and from school. As recommended by

previous studies (Kalajas-Tilga et al., 2019; Polet et al., 2019), having a


reduced version of four items for this instrument would also avoid
unnecessary redundancies to measure the same construct and allows
measuring perceived autonomy support in a shorter and quicker way.

This is especially important considering that the same items are repeated 
for each social agent. Therefore, the 36 items of the three versions 
of PASSES were reduced to only 12 items in PASS-ACS (i.e. four
items per version).

3. Study 2

The objectives of Study 2 were to verify the four-item one-factor
internal structure obtained in the Study 1 by means of a con<U+FB01>rmatory
factor analysis, and to inspect both its invariance across gender via
multi-group factor analysis and its reliability through an internal consistency 
and temporal stability analysis. Additionally, this study also
examined the instrument’s predictive validity via structural equation
modeling by analyzing the relationships between BPN satisfaction in
ACS, intrinsic motivation for ACS, and students’ perceptions of autonomy 
support for ACS provided by teachers, parents, and peers.
Grounded in SDT (Ryan and Deci, 2017; Vallerand and Lalande, 2011)
and previous research in di<U+FB00>erent school physical activity settings
(Gonzalez-Cutre et al., 2014; Hagger et al., 2009; Sevil-Serrano et al.,
2018), this study hypothesized that students’ perceptions of autonomy
support for ACS from these three sources would positively predict satisfaction 
of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs and, in turn,
BPN satisfaction would positively predict intrinsic motivation in ACS. It
was also expected that the e<U+FB00>ect of students’ perceptions of autonomy
support for ACS from these three sources on intrinsic motivation would
be signi<U+FB01>cantly mediated by the BPN satisfaction.


3.1. Materials and method

3.1.1. Participants
The participants were 712 students (342 boys and 370 girls), aged
between 11 and 17 years old (Mage = 13.07, SDage = 1.70), from four
medium-to-large-sized Spanish cities of north-east, south, and south-east.
 All schools (N = 10) were public, located in urban areas and were
shown to be on average of Spanish standard school. Speci<U+FB01>cally, 303
primary school students (149 boys and 154 girls; Mage = 11.52,
SDage = 0.55) and 409 secondary school students (193 boys and 216
girls; Mage = 14.16, SDage = 1.32) participated.
Regarding the students’ mode of commuting to and from school, 126
(41.60%) primary school students and 295 (72.13%) secondary school
students actively commuted to and from school, while 54 (17.82%)
primary school and 49 (11.98%) secondary school students passively
commuted to school when the distance between home and school was
less than 2.00 km. Meanwhile, when the distance between home and
school was higher than 2.00 km, 110 (36.30%) primary school students
and 51 (12.47%) secondary school students commuted passively to
school, while 13 (4.28%) primary school and 14 (3.42%) secondary
school students actively commuted to and from school.
Concerning the time spent commuting to and from school, 499
(70.08%, 199 primary school and 300 secondary school) students spent
less than 15 min, 179 (25.14%; 88 primary school and 91 secondary
school) students spent between 15 and 30 min, 26 (3.65%; 10 primary
school and 16 secondary school) students spent between 31 and 60 min,
and 8 (1.13%; 6 primary school and 2 secondary school) students spent
more than 60 min.
With regard to the people who often accompany students to and
from school, 349 (52 primary school and 297 secondary school) students 
were accompanied by friends, 324 (203 primary school and 121
secondary school) students were accompanied by their mothers, 220
(115 primary school and 105 secondary school) students were accompanied 
by their fathers, 215 (39 primary school and 176 secondary
school) students went to school by themselves, 165 (77 primary school
and 88 secondary school) students were accompanied by theirs siblings,
29 (17 primary school and 12 secondary school) students were accompanied 
by their grandparents and, <U+FB01>nally, 50 (25 primary school
and 25 secondary school) students were accompanied by other people
(no information was provided by them).
To analyze the temporal stability, the measurement instrument was
administered twice in a time interval of two weeks to an independent
sample of 67 secondary school students (34 boys and 33 girls) between
12 and 18 years old (Mage = 14.06, SDage = 1.79) from one of the four
Spanish cities that participated in this study.


3.1.2. Instruments
3.1.2.1. Perceived autonomy support for active commuting to and from
school from teachers, parents, and peers. The four-item factor structure
obtained in the exploratory factor analysis of the Study 1 was used to
assess the students’ perceptions of autonomy support for ACS from
teachers, parents, and peers.

3.1.2.2. Basic psychological need satisfaction in active commuting to and
from school. Students’ perceptions of autonomy, competence, and
relatedness need satisfaction in ACS were assessed using the Basic
Psychological Need Satisfaction in Active Commuting to and from School
Scale (Burgueño et al., 2020). The instrument was preceded by the
statement “What do you think about your usual mode of commuting to
and from school?”. The scale consists of 12 items grouped into four
items per factor to measure the satisfaction of the need for autonomy
(e.g. “I feel that I can choose how to commute to and from school”),
competence (e.g. “I feel able to walk or cycle to and from school”), and
relatedness (e.g. “I feel extremely comfortable when someone
accompanies me to school”). Each item is responded via a 5-point
Likert-type scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). In the
validation study conducted by Burgueño et al. (2020), the con<U+FB01>rmatory
factor analysis supported a 12-item three-factor correlated model (<U+03C7>2
[df = 51] = 73.17, p < .001; <U+03C7>2/df = 1.44; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.99;
SRMR = 0.025; RMSEA = 0.034 [90% CI = 0.021–0.047]), which
remained invariant across gender and age. The internal consistency
analysis displayed acceptable values for autonomy (a = 0.81, <U+03C1> = 0.84,
AVE = 0.58), competence (a = 0.92, <U+03C1> = 0.92, AVE = 0.74), and
relatedness (a = 0.82, <U+03C1> = 0.83, AVE = 0.55) need satisfaction in ACS.

3.1.2.3. Intrinsic motivation in active commuting to and from school. To
assess intrinsic motivation, one of the six factors composing the
Behavioural Regulation in Active Commuting to and from School
Questionnaire (Burgueño et al., 2019) was used. This factor consists of
four items (e.g. “I enjoy walking or cycling to and from school”), which
are responded via a 5-point Likert-type scale, from 0 (not true for me) to
4 (very true for me). The items were preceded by the statement “I go or
would go to and from school walking or cycling because…”. In the
validation study conducted by Burgueño et al. (2019), the con<U+FB01>rmatory
factor analysis of the whole instrument supported a six-factor correlated
model (<U+03C7>2 [df = 215] = 550.17, p < .001; <U+03C7>2/df = 2.56; CFI = 0.93;
TLI = 0.92; SRMR = 0.050; RMSEA = 0.062 [90%
CI = 0.056–0.069]), which was invariant across gender and age. The
internal consistency analysis revealed adequate values for intrinsic
motivation in ACS (a = 0.91; <U+03C1> = 0.91).

3.1.3. Procedure
For data collection, the same guidelines and criteria outlined in the
procedure section in the Study 1 were used.

3.1.4. Data analysis
Data were statistically processed using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22.0; Armonk,
NY, USA) and AMOS (version 22.0; Armonk, NY, USA). Validity evidence 
based on the internal structure of the teachers’, parents’, and
peers’ versions of the instrument were provided via con<U+FB01>rmatory factor
analysis. Under the assumption of multivariate normality (Mardia’s
coe<U+FB03>cient = 0.97, critical rate = 1.86 for teachers version; Mardia’s
coe<U+FB03>cient = 5.69, critical rate = 7.47 for parents version; Mardia’s
coe<U+FB03>cient = 5.96, critical rate = 7.97 for peers version) (Kline, 2015),
con<U+FB01>rmatory factor analyses with the maximum likelihood method
were conducted. A variety of <U+FB01>t indices were employed to assess the
goodness of <U+FB01>t for each factor model: ratio between <U+03C7>2 and degrees of
freedom (<U+03C7>2/df), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index
(TLI), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR), and Root
Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with a con<U+FB01>dence interval
at 90% (90%CI). In general, values less than 5 for the <U+03C7>2/df
325

R. Burgueño, et al.
statistic, higher than 0.95 for CFI and TLI, lower than 0.080 for SRMR,




and 0.060 for RMSEA are representative of a good <U+FB01>t (Hu and Bentler,
1999). The standardized regression weights are adequate with values









over 0.50 and the standardized residual covariances with values below
2.58 in absolute terms (Hair et al., 2018).

Invariance across gender was tested by means of a multi-sample






factor analysis following the methodological proposal by Putnick and
Bornstein (2016). This proposal tests the tenability of four progressively
constrained models in order to examine con<U+FB01>gural invariance (i.e. no



equality constraints), metric invariance (i.e. equal item loadings),
strong invariance (i.e. equal item loadings and item intercepts, concurrently), 
and strict invariance (i.e. equal item loadings, item intercepts,
and item error variances, concurrently). The absence of statistically 
signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences in the <U+03C7>2 test between two successively

constrained models is considered to be an indicative of the invariance of


the instrument (Fan and Sivo, 2009).

Reliability evidence was determined through both an internal consistency 
and a temporal stability analysis. Internal consistency was inspected 
via an estimation of the Cronbach alpha (a) coe<U+FB03>cient,



Raykov’s composite reliability (<U+03C1>) coe<U+FB03>cient, and average variance

extracted (AVE). Both a and <U+03C1> are acceptable with values over 0.70
(Viladrich et al., 2017), while AVE is suitable with values higher than

0.50 (Hair et al., 2018). Temporal stability was examined by means of

the intra-class correlation coe<U+FB03>cient (ICC). This value should be above
0.70 to be considered acceptable (Fleiss, 2011).
Following the two-step methodological approach outlined by Kline

(2015), structural equation modeling was performed to provide predictive 
validity evidence. The <U+FB01>rst step (i.e. measurement model) consisted 
in examining the bidirectional relationships among all study

variables via con<U+FB01>rmatory factor analysis. The second step (i.e. hypothesized 
structural modeling) examined the theoretical motivational
sequence established by SDT (i.e. perception of autonomy support from
teachers, parents, and peers <U+2192> BPN satisfaction <U+2192> intrinsic motivation). 
In accordance with Kline (2015), the maximum likelihood
method together with the bootstrapping procedure with 5000 iterations

was applied given the violation of the assumption of multivariate normality 
(Mardia’s coe<U+FB03>cient = 232.83, critical rate = 75.79).
3.2. Results

3.2.1. Con<U+FB01>rmatory factor analysis

With respect to the PASS-ACS-Teachers, its four-item factor structure 
obtained a good <U+FB01>t: <U+03C7>2 (2, n = 712) = 0.19, p = .911; <U+03C7>2/
df = 0.09; CFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.999; SRMR = 0.003; RMSEA = 0.001
(90% CI = 0.001–0.029). Table 2 shows signi<U+FB01>cant (p < .001) standardized 
regression weights ranging from 0.62 to 0.80. The standardized 
residual covariances were between -0.09 and 0.16.

In relation to the PASS-ACS-Parents, its four-item factor structure

showed a good <U+FB01>t: <U+03C7>2 (2, n = 712) = 3.82, p = .148; <U+03C7>2/df = 1.91;
CFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.996; SRMR = 0.011; RMSEA = 0.036 (90%
CI = 0.001–0.090). Table 2 shows signi<U+FB01>cant (p < .001) standardized

regression weights ranging from 0.59 to 0.85. The standardized residual
covariances were between -0.48 and 0.60.
With regard to the PASS-ACS-Peers, its four-item factor structure

revealed a good <U+FB01>t: <U+03C7>2 (2, n = 712) = 3.98, p = .137; <U+03C7>2/df = 1.99;
CFI = 0.999; TLI = 0.996; SRMR = 0.010; RMSEA = 0.037 (90%
CI = 0.001–0.091). Table 2 shows signi<U+FB01>cant (p < .001) standardized

regression weights ranging from 0.72 to 0.85. The standardized residual
covariances were between -0.23 and 0.60.

3.2.2. Gender invariance analysis
Table 3 showed no statistically signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erence (p > .05) in
the <U+03C7>2 test between the successive progressively constrained models for

the PASS-ACS-Teachers, PASS-ACS-Parents, and PASS-ACS-Peers.
Therefore, the null hypothesis of invariance across gender could be
accepted for the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-

3.2.4. Predictive validity analysis

The measurement model showed an adequate <U+FB01>t: <U+03C7>2 (325,
n = 712) = 683.91, p < .001, <U+03C7>2/df = 2.10; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.96;
SRMR = 0.041; RMSEA = 0.039 (90%CI = 0.035–0.044). The standardized 
regression weights were statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (p < .001)
and ranged from 0.46 to 0.88. The correlations among factors ranged
from 0.15 to 0.76. All these results supported the robustness of the
measurement model.
The hypothesized theoretical model also obtained acceptable <U+FB01>t
indices: <U+03C7>2 (328, n = 712) = 770.89, p < .001, <U+03C7>2/df = 2.35;
CFI = 0.96; TLI = 0.95; SRMR = 0.064; RMSEA = 0.044
(90%CI = 0.040–0.048). As Fig. 1 shows, students’ perceptions of autonomy 
support for ACS from teachers, parents, and peers positively
predicted the BPN satisfaction for autonomy (ß = 0.22, p = .025;
ß = 0.26, p < .001; ß = 0.27, p < .001), competence (ß = 0.28,
p < .001; ß = 0.29, p < .001; ß = 0.25, p < .001), and relatedness
(ß = 0.16, p = .038; ß = 0.21, p = .014; ß = 0.18, p = .035), re-
spectively. In turn, the BPN satisfaction for autonomy (ß = 0.24,
p < .001), competence (ß = 0.31, p < .001), and relatedness
(ß = 0.15, p = .049) positively predicted intrinsic motivation. In addition, 
the satisfaction of the three BPN signi<U+FB01>cantly mediated the relationships 
between students’ perceptions of autonomy support from
teachers (indirect e<U+FB00>ects: ß = 0.06; 95%CI = 0.03, 0.20, p = .003),
parents (indirect e<U+FB00>ects: ß = 0.07; 95%CI = 0.03, 0.16, p = .004) and
peers (indirect e<U+FB00>ects: ß = 0.06; 95%CI = 0.02, 0.12, p = .041), and
intrinsic motivation. The explained variance was 15% for autonomy
need satisfaction, 20% for competence need satisfaction, 10% for relatedness 
need satisfaction, and 28% for intrinsic motivation. As a
whole, these results support the instrument’s predictive validity.

3.3. Discussion

The objective of Study 2 was to analyze the psychometric properties
of the four-item one-factor structure previously obtained for the teachers’, 
parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-ACS. These results

to measure the students’ perceptions of autonomy support for ACS from
teachers, parents, and peers.
The results of the con<U+FB01>rmatory analyses for the teachers’, parents’,
and peers’ versions of the PASS-ACS supported the four-item one-factor
structure. In each version, all standardized regression weights of these
four items were signi<U+FB01>cant and higher than 0.50. Furthermore, the
standardized residual covariances did not exceed 2.58 as an absolute
value, which allows one to dismiss the presence of misspeci<U+FB01>cations in
its internal structure. The multi-sample factor analysis to examine
gender invariance showed that the four-item one-factor structure was
invariant between boys and girls for the three perceived social agents.
This would mean that the PASS-ACS Teachers, PASS-ACS Parents, and
PASS-ACS Peers can be used to explore the possible gender di<U+FB00>erences
in perceived autonomy support for ACS from di<U+FB00>erent social agents.
On the other hand, the adequate level of internal consistency for
teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-ACS was veri<U+FB01>ed
with acceptable values from Cronbach’s alpha, Raykov’s composite reliability 
coe<U+FB03>cient, and the average variance extracted. Likewise, the
temporal stability for the three versions of the PASS-ACS was supported
via the intraclass correlation coe<U+FB03>cient. As a whole, the internal consistency 
and temporal stability analyses suggest that the three versions
of the PASS-ACS have been found to be reliable for measuring the
students’ perceptions of autonomy support for ACS from three of the
most important social agents of the school community.
The results from the structural equation modeling provided predictive 
validity evidence for the PASS-ACS. These <U+FB01>ndings are congruent 
with other previous studies in di<U+FB00>erent school physical activity
settings that showed that perceived autonomy support from di<U+FB00>erent
social agents (e.g. teachers, parents, or peers) was positively related to
BPN satisfaction (Sevil-Serrano et al., 2018) which, in turn, was positively 
related to intrinsic motivation (Gonzalez-Cutre et al., 2014;
Hagger et al., 2009). Although autonomy support has been particularly
associated with autonomy need satisfaction in physical activity settings
(i.e. leisure-time physical activity, physical education, sport), it is also
positively related to competence and relatedness need satisfaction
(Raabe et al., 2019; Vasconcellos et al., 2019). These results would
imply that autonomy support for ACS from teachers, parents, and peers
may cause that young people felt autonomous to choose an active mode
of commuting to and from school (i.e. autonomy need satisfaction), felt
competent and with the required skills to walk or cycle to school (i.e.
competence need satisfaction) and felt understood and connected with
their parents and peers who commute to and from school with them
(i.e. relatedness need satisfaction). Consistent with the SDT tenets, the
ful<U+FB01>lment of these BPN was positively associated with intrinsic motivation 
in ACS. Nonetheless, it should be highlighted that competence
need satisfaction was the strongest predictor of intrinsic motivation

toward ACS, suggesting the importance for young people to feel e<U+FB00>ective 
and con<U+FB01>dent of commuting actively to school. These feelings               
could be closely linked to the involvement of enjoyment and fun in the          
ACS behavior.                                                                   
Therefore, it would be fundamental to develop a multicomponent                 
school-based intervention based on SDT, adopting a whole school approach 
involving teachers, parents, and peers to increase the ACS rates.       
Particularly, given that perceived autonomy support from parents was           
the strongest predictor of the students’ BPN satisfaction in the present         
study, school-based interventions should include not only teachers, as           
seen in most of the previous studies (Villa-González et al., 2018), but            
also parents and peers as key <U+FB01>gures in the ACS promotion.                       
ents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-ACS were validated only in

In order to design, implement and evaluate an e<U+FB00>ective intervention 
to promote walking and cycling to and from school, it is necessary     
to validate well-developed instruments to identify the determinants and  
correlates involved in ACS. Based on SDT (Ryan and Deci, 2017, 2019),       
this research aimed to adapt the Spanish teachers’, parents’, and peers’  
versions of the PASSES (Gonzalez-Cutre et al., 2014; Moreno-Murcia     
et al., 2008) to the ACS context, and to examine the psychometric     
properties in a sample of primary and secondary school students. The            
results derived from these two sequential studies showed evidence to            
consider the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the PASS-ACS as        
psychometrically robust measures to assess the students’ perceptions of          
autonomy support for ACS provided from these three social agents. To         
the best of our knowledge, there were no valid and reliable scales to       
date to measure the perceived autonomy support in the ACS setting.           
Previous studies have examined students’ perceptions of autonomy   
support for ACS from di<U+FB00>erent social agents (i.e. teachers, parents, and  
friends) using qualitative approaches (Simons et al., 2013) or with      
questionnaires which measured social support without a solid conceptual 
framework (Huertas-Delgado et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2014).
Therefore, this is the <U+FB01>rst valid and reliable scale in the ACS context              
grounded in SDT that measures students’ perceptions of autonomy
support for ACS provided by three of the most important agents of the  
                  
school community. Thus, this research contributes to the literature by
providing three versions of the PASS-ACS that can be used to identify
the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ involvement in their children’s active
school transport. Likewise, this study also provides some preliminary
insight into the motivational dynamics underlying ACS using the SDT
framework.
Despite the good psychometric properties showed by the four-item
one-factor structure of the teachers’, parents’, and peers’ versions of the
PASS-ACS, a series of limitations and future perspectives should be
considered. First, given the absence of a random sampling technique in
this study, we should interpret the obtained results carefully, limiting
 its generalization to the whole population. Second, the teachers’, par-
Spanish students. Taking into consideration these limitations, future
studies should analyze the psychometric properties of this instrument in
populations with di<U+FB00>erent features (e.g. other religions, races, and
ethnicities), ages (e.g. preschool and undergraduate students), and
socio-cultural contexts to provide more evidences of its validity and
reliability. In particular, to explore the cross-cultural invariance for the
PASS-ACS would be a prerequisite for its rigorous and objective comparison 
given that it will allow researchers to make statistical inferences
at an international level in relation to the students’ perceptions of autonomy 
support for ACS provided by teachers, parents, and peers.
Third, as mothers and fathers play di<U+FB00>erent roles in their children’s
physical activity levels (McDavid et al., 2012; Sevil-Serrano et al.,
2018), it would be also interesting to examine separately the perception
of autonomy support for ACS from mothers and fathers. Analyzing
other socialization agents such as siblings or grandparents is also a new
avenue of research. Fourth, some important correlates of ACS such as
built environment was not evaluated in the present study (Ikeda et al.,
2018). Future research should also examine the relations between the
features of the neighborhood environment around children’s or adolescents’ 
residence and school and the motivational processes of ACS.

5. Conclusions

In summary, the PASS-ACS has shown to be a psychometrically
robust instrument to assess the students' perceptions of autonomy
support for ACS from teachers, parents, and peers. This scale would be
essential to examine the key role of autonomy support for ACS from
di<U+FB00>erent social agents in the theoretical motivational sequence established 
by SDT (i.e. socio-contextual factors <U+2192> BPN <U+2192> motivation <U+2192>
cognitive, behavioral, and a<U+FB00>ective outcomes), that aims to identify
what sources should be mainly involved in the design of school-based
interventions for promoting ACS. The development of this instrument
will also allow us to examine the e<U+FB00>ects of school active commuting
promotion programs on students’ perception of autonomy support for
ACS from the most important social agents of the school community.
