  abstract = {Children's neighborhood spaces have the potential to enhance their wellbeing by affording active and independent travel. Drawing on a case study of 49 children aged between 9 and 13, living in a suburb of Perth, Western Australia, this study adopts a capability approach to understand how children's travel in the neighborhood environment supports their wellbeing. A mixed methods approach is used to explore children's activity spaces: 1) GPS tracks; 2) children's activity diaries; 3) surveys; and 4) children's photo/pictorial collages. Activity spaces and affordances are used to inform the capability framework. We compare the realized local activity spaces (as confidence ellipses) to the potential activity spaces, indicative of the children's potential to achieve wellbeing, and draw on children's photographic and pictorial evaluations of their neighborhood to provide a qualitative perspective on the range of affordances. The results show substantial constraints to the children's active travel and independent mobility, contrasting with the positive view of the neighborhood the children hold. Children were mainly chauffeured at short distances that could have easily been walked or cycled, yet the photo-collage reveals a rich diversity of places and activities children access and desire to reach and use. The capability framework offers insight into some of the factors limiting children's travel, but also highlights the agency children have in shaping their own travel behavior.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify factors associated with generalized and stranger-specific parental fear (PF) about children's independent mobility (CIM), a critical aspect of physical activity. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey; random sampling frame, minimum quotas of fathers, rural residents. SETTING: State of Victoria, Australia. SUBJECTS: Parents of children aged 9 to 15 years (n = 1779), 71\% response rate. MEASURES: Validated measures of PF and fear of strangers (FoS); parent, child, social, and environmental factors. ANALYSIS: Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression stratified by child age (9-10; 11-13; 14-15). RESULTS: Adjusted models explained a substantial proportion of variance across all age groups (PF: 33.6\%-36.7\%; FoS: 39.1\%-44.0\%). Perceived disapproval from others was consistently associated with both outcomes (PF: {$\beta$} =.11 to 23, p {$\leq$} .05; FoS: {$\beta$} =.17-.21, p {$\leq$} .001) as was parents' perception of children's competence to travel safely (PF: {$\beta$} = -.24 to -.11, p {$\leq$} .05; FoS: {$\beta$} = -.16 to -.13, p {$\leq$} .01). Factors associated with FoS included having a female child ({$\beta$} = -.21 to -.13, p {$\leq$} .001), language other than English ({$\beta$} = .09 to.11, p {$\leq$} .01), and low levels of parent education ({$\beta$} = -.14 to -08, p {$\leq$} .05). CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that social norms, child competence, and perceptions about the benefits of CIM underpin PF. This evidence informs the development of interventions to reduce PF and promote CIM and children's physical activity.},

  abstract = {Background Previous research has indicated a decline in children's independent mobility; however, comparisons between directly-related generations are scarce. This study sought to determine the direct generational change in children's independent mobility and active transport in a large sample of New Zealanders. Methods 544 children (mean age 12.2 {$\pm$} 0.6 years) and 500 parents (43.9 {$\pm$} 5.8 years) participated in the study. Independent mobility (IM) was measured with IM Licences (parental permission to travel unsupervised) and IM Index (summed score from a questionnaire of destinations independently travelled). Questions on active transport, organsied activities, bicycle and vehicle ownership were also included. Parents recalled their behaviour retrospectively as 10\textendash 12-year-olds. Results Generalised linear modelling indicated that the proportion of parents who actively transported to and from school was significantly higher than in children (91.8\% vs. 49.3\% to school; 93.2\% vs. 56.9\% from school). The IM Index dropped generationally for both males (2.05 to 1.53) and females (1.77 to 1.40). Significant differences in IM Licences were also observed: parents being allowed to travel to school (OR 2.18 95\% CI: 1.31, 3.63), cross main roads (OR 2.26 95\% CI: 1.34, 3.71.), cycle main roads (OR 4.99 95\% CI: 3.62, 6.87), and be out after dark (OR 3.05 95\% CI: 2.12, 4.38) compared to children today. Bike ownership increased generationally with adults having an average of 2.5 bikes (95\% CI: 2.37, 2.64) and children having 3.3 (95\% CI: 3.05, 3.54). The average number of organised activities for adults was 1.8 (95\% CI: 1.62, 1.89), which increased in children to an average number of 4.1 activities (95\% CI: 3.89, 4.25). Conclusion These findings demonstrate a clear generational decline in children's independent mobility and active transport. Greater promotion of active modes of travel and unstructured roaming in the neighbourhood may be an important step in reversing the reduction in this fundamental behaviour.},

  abstract = {Objective This study describes temporal and spatial trends in active transportation for school trips in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada's largest city-region. Methods Proportions of trips by travel mode to and from school were estimated and compared for children (11\textendash 13~years) and youth (14\textendash 15~years). Data were drawn from the 1986, 1996, 2001, and 2006 versions of the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS). Results Between 1986 and 2006, walking mode share for trips to school declined (53.0\%\textendash 42.5\% for 11\textendash 13~year olds, 38.6\%\textendash 30.7\% for 14\textendash 15~year olds). Although there has also been a decline in walking home from school, walking rates were higher in the afternoon. In 2006, younger children in the suburbs walked less to school (36.1\%\textendash 42.3\% of trips) than 11\textendash 13~year olds in Toronto (48.1\%) and Toronto's 14\textendash 15~year olds walked less (38.3\% of trips) but used transit more (44.8\% of trips) than students in the suburbs. Conclusion The findings indicate a period of decline (1986\textendash 2006) in the use of active modes for journeys to and from school for both age groups. Policies and programs to increase active transportation should acknowledge the spatial, temporal, and demographic heterogeneity of school travel decisions and outcomes.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: As children's lifestyles have become increasingly sedentary, active school travel can be a relatively accessible way to increase their daily physical activity. In recent years, several different models of interventions have been utilized to promote children participating in active school travel. This review documents and analyzes the different active school travel intervention methodologies that have been used in North America (Canada or U.S.) by collecting, organizing, and evaluating data relating to all phases of active school travel interventions. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This systematic review developed a key word search and applied it in six databases (BIOSIS Previews, GeoBase, PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science) to gather scholarly literature. A total of 22 studies evaluating children's active school travel interventions in a North American setting (four Canada, 18 U.S.) were identified for the period between January 2010 and March 2017. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Applying the Safe Routes to School Education, Encouragement, Enforcement, Engineering, Equity, and Evaluation ("6 E's") framework, interventions were thematically assessed for their structure and organization, approaches and methods, and outcomes and discussions. Encouragement and education were the most commonly observed themes within the different methodologies of the studies reviewed. Details relating to intervention approaches and methods were common; whereas data relating to intervention structure and organization received much less attention. CONCLUSIONS: Kingdon's multiple streams approach was applied to frame the findings for program facilitators and evaluators. Within the multiple streams approach, several considerations are offered to address and potentially improve active school travel intervention conceptualization, partnerships, organization, and evaluation.},

  abstract = {Background Despite related physical/mental health benefits, children{${'}$}s independent mobility for school travel (i.e. walking/cycling without adult accompaniment) has declined in recent decades. Purpose To examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between social/physical environmental variables and independent mobility on the school journey. Methods Participants were 1121 9\textendash 10 year-olds residing within 1600m of their school in urban/rural areas of Norfolk, UK in 2007 (T1). At one year (T2) 491 children were followed-up. At T1, parents survey-reported perceptions of the social/physical environment and rules regarding their child{${'}$}s physical activity. Characteristics of the neighborhood, route to school and school environment were measured using a Geographical Information System and school audits. At both time-points children survey-reported their usual travel mode and whether accompanied. Regression analyses were conducted in 2013. Results Around half walked/cycled to school without adult accompaniment (T1, 43\%; T2, 53\%). Parents often allowing their child to play outside anywhere within the neighborhood (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.14 (95\% CI 1.24\textendash 7.96)) and household car access (AOR 0.27 (95\% CI 0.08\textendash 0.94)) were associated longitudinally with boys walking/cycling independently to school. Land use mix (AOR 1.38 (95\% CI 1.06\textendash 1.79)), proportion of main roads in the neighborhood (AOR 0.67 (95\% CI 0.47\textendash 0.94)) and parental encouragement for walking/cycling (AOR 0.40 (95\% CI 0.20\textendash 0.80)) were associated longitudinally with girls walking/cycling independently to school. Conclusions Interventions should develop parents{${'}$} skills to teach their children to be independently mobile and to build confidence regarding venturing out without parental accompaniment. Urban planners should consider designing neighborhoods in which residences, business/retail outlets and sports facilities are co-located to promote active transport.},

The purpose of this paper is to review intervention studies related to active school transportation to guide future intervention research. A systematic review was conducted to identify intervention studies of active transportation to school published in the scientific literature through January 2010. Five electronic databases and a manual search were conducted. Detailed information was extracted, including a quantitative assessment comparing the effect sizes, and a qualitative assessment using an established evaluation tool. We identified 14 interventions that focused on active transportation to school. These interventions mainly focused on primary school children in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Almost all the interventions used quasi-experimental designs (10/14), and most of the interventions reported a small effect size on active transportation (6/14). More research with higher quality study designs and measures should be conducted to further evaluate interventions and to determine the most successful strategies for increasing active transportation to school.},

METHODS: Parents in RESIDE's fourth survey reported whether their child (8-15 years; n = 181) was allowed to travel without an adult to school, friend's house, park and local shop. Objective physical environment measures were matched to each of these destinations. Social environment measures included neighborhood perceptions and items specific to local independent mobility. RESULTS: Independent mobility to local destinations ranged from 30\% to 48\%. Independent mobility to a local park was less likely as the distance to the closest park (small and large size) increased and less likely with additional school grounds (P {$<$} .05). Independent mobility to school was less likely as the distance to the closest large park increased and if the neighborhood was perceived as unsafe (P {$<$} .05). Independent mobility to a park or shops decreased if parenting social norms were unsupportive of children's local independent movement (P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSIONS: Independent mobility appears dependent upon the specific destination being visited and the impact of neighborhood features varies according to the destination examined. Findings highlight the importance of access to different types and sizes of urban green space for children's independent mobility to parks.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the last decades, the use of active travel modes declined in all age groups. Childhood is a critical time to establish lifelong healthy patterns. To develop effective interventions in this age group, insight in the correlates of health behaviors and the possible mediating factors is necessary. Among children, the role of parents may not be overlooked. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the associations of parental perceptions of neighborhood environmental attributes with active transport and total physical activity in 10-12 year old Belgian boys and girls. Furthermore, this study examined the potential mediating effect of independent mobility on these associations. METHODS: In the present study, 736 10-12 year old children and their parents from 44 elementary schools in Flanders, Belgium, participated. The children were asked to wear an activity monitor and to fill in a survey questioning demographic factors and the Flemish Physical Activity Questionnaire. The parents filled in a survey concerning demographic factors, the child's level of independent mobility and environmental perceptions (Neighborhood Environmental Walkability Scale). RESULTS: Overall, boys reported more active transport when parents perceived more land use mix diversity, shorter distances to school, good land use mix access, higher residential density and less pleasing neighborhood aesthetics. Higher total physical activity levels were reported when parents perceived shorter distances to school and availability of walking/cycling infrastructure. None of the associations was mediated by independent mobility in boys. Girls reported more active transport when parents perceived higher residential density, more land use mix diversity, shorter distances to school, good land use mix access, available walking/cycling infrastructure and convenient recreational facilities. Girls reported higher total physical activity levels when parents perceived high residential density, good land use mix access, well-maintained and high quality walking/cycling infrastructures and more traffic safety. Independent mobility was found to be an important mediator of these associations in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Neighborhood environmental interventions to increase children's active transport and physical activity can be effective when combined with awareness raising programs for parents. Furthermore, among girls encouraging independent mobility may contribute to behavior change.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of environmental correlates that are associated with route choice during active transportation to school (ATS) by comparing characteristics of actual walking and cycling routes between home and school with the shortest possible route to school. METHODS: Children (n\,=\,184; 86 boys, 98 girls; age range: 8-12 years) from seven schools in suburban municipalities in the Netherlands participated in the study. Actual walking and cycling routes to school were measured with a GPS-device that children wore during an entire school week. Measurements were conducted in the period April-June 2014. Route characteristics for both actual and shortest routes between home and school were determined for a buffer of 25 m from the routes and divided into four categories: Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, traffic areas), Aesthetics (presence of greenery/natural water ways along route), Traffic (safety measures such as traffic lights, zebra crossings, speed bumps) and Type of street (pedestrian, cycling, residential streets, arterial roads). Comparison of characteristics of shortest and actual routes was performed with conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Median distance of the actual walking routes was 390.1 m, whereas median distance of actual cycling routes was 673.9 m. Actual walking and cycling routes were not significantly longer than the shortest possible routes. Children mainly traveled through residential areas on their way to school ({$>$}80\% of the route). Traffic lights were found to be positively associated with route choice during ATS. Zebra crossings were less often present along the actual routes (walking: OR\,=\,0.17, 95\% CI\,=\,0.05-0.58; cycling: OR\,=\,0.31, 95\% CI\,=\,0.14-0.67), and streets with a high occurrence of accidents were less often used during cycling to school (OR\,=\,0.57, 95\% CI\,=\,0.43-0.76). Moreover, percentage of visible surface water along the actual route was higher compared to the shortest routes (walking: OR\,=\,1.04, 95\% CI\,=\,1.01-1.07; cycling: OR\,=\,1.03, 95\% CI\,=\,1.01-1.05). DISCUSSION: This study showed a novel approach to examine built environmental exposure during active transport to school.

  abstract = {Cycling to school has been identified as an important target for increasing physical activity levels in children. However, knowledge about correlates of cycling to school is scarce as many studies did not make a distinction between walking and cycling to school. Moreover, correlates of cycling to school for those who live within a distance, that in theory would allow cycling to school, stay undiscovered. Therefore, this study examined individual, social and physical environmental correlates of never and always cycling to/from school among 10 to 12 year old Belgian children living within a 3.0 km distance from school. 850 parents completed a questionnaire to assess personal, family, behavioral, cognitive, social and physical environmental factors related to the cycling behavior of their children. Parents indicated on a question matrix how many days a week their child (1) walked, (2) cycled, was (3) driven by car or (4) public transport to and from school during fall, winter and spring. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the correlates. Overall, 39.3\% of children never cycled to school and 16.5\% of children always cycled to school. Children with high levels of independent mobility and good cycling skills perceived by their parents were more likely to always cycle to school (resp. OR 1.06; 95\% CI 1.04-1.15 and OR 1.08; 95\% CI 1.01-1.16) and less likely to never cycle to school (resp. OR 0.84; 95\% CI 0.78-0.91 and OR 0.77; 95\% CI 0.7-0.84). Children with friends who encourage them to cycle to school were more likely to always cycle to school (OR 1.08; 95\% CI 1.01-1.15) and less likely to never cycle to school (OR 0.9; 95\% CI 0.83-1.0). In addition, children with parents who encourage them to cycle to school were less likely to never cycle to school (OR 0.78; 95\% CI 0.7-0.87). Regarding the physical environmental factors, only neighborhood traffic safety was significantly associated with cycling: i.e., children were more likely to always cycle to school if neighborhood traffic was perceived as safe by their parents (OR 1.18; 95\% CI 1.07-1.31). Individual, social and physical environmental factors were associated with children's cycling behavior to/from school. However, the contribution of the physical environment is limited and highlights the fact that interventions for increasing cycling to school should not focus solely on the physical environment.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between school travel mode and physical activity using a sampling frame that purposefully locates schools in varying neighbourhoods. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 785 children (10.57 {$\pm$} 0.7 years) in Toronto, Canada. Physical activity was measured by accelerometry and travel mode was self-reported by parents. Linear regression models accounting for school clustering effects examined the associations between mode choice, BMI, and physical activity and were estimated adjusting for age, types of neighbourhoods and travel distance to school. RESULTS: Significant associations between walking to school and moderate activity during weekdays were found. Interactions between walking to school and travel distance to school were found only in boys with significant associations between walking to school and higher physical activity levels in those living within 1000-1600 meters from school. Boys walking to school and living in this range accumulated 7.6 more minutes of daily MVPA than boys who were driven. CONCLUSIONS: Walking to school can make a modest but significant contribution to overall physical activity. This contribution was modified by travel distance and not school neighbourhood socioeconomic status or the built environment.},

We examined: (1) the impact of parents' fear of strangers on children's independent mobility; and (2) whether informal social control (i.e., parents' confidence that other residents would look out for local children) mitigated any association. Gender stratified logistic regression models tested these associations for 10\textendash 12 year-olds and their parents (n=1231) in Perth, Australia. For girls, parental fear of strangers was associated with lower odds of independent mobility (OR=0.71, p=0.002), and informal social control and other social and built environment variables had little attenuating influence. This pattern was consistent for boys; however odds ratios were lower and statistical significance weaker. Initiatives that target parental fears combined with interventions that normalise children's walking may help increase independent mobility.},

  abstract = {Background Increasing participation in transportation cycling represents a useful strategy for increasing children's physical activity levels. Knowledge on how to design environments to encourage adoption and maintenance of transportation cycling is limited and relies mainly on observational studies. The current study experimentally investigates the relative importance of micro-scale environmental factors for children's transportation cycling, as these micro-scale factors are easier to change within an existing neighborhood compared to macro-scale environmental factors (i.e. connectivity, land-use mix, \ldots ). Methods Researchers recruited children and their parents (n = 1232) via 45 randomly selected schools across Flanders and completed an online questionnaire which consisted of 1) demographic questions; and 2) a choice-based conjoint (CBC) task. During this task, participants chose between two photographs which we had experimentally manipulated in seven micro-scale environmental factors: type of cycle path; evenness of cycle path; traffic speed; traffic density; presence of speed bumps; environmental maintenance; and vegetation. Participants indicated which route they preferred to (let their child) cycle along. To find the relative importance of these micro-scale environmental factors, we conducted Hierarchical Bayes analyses. Results Type of cycle path emerged as the most important factor by far among both children and their parents, followed by traffic density and maintenance, and evenness of the cycle path among children. Among parents, speed limits and maintenance emerged as second most important, followed by evenness of the cycle path, and traffic density. Conclusion Findings indicate that improvements in micro-scale environmental factors might be effective for increasing children's transportation cycling, since they increase the perceived supportiveness of the physical environment for transportation cycling. Investments in creating a clearly designated space for the young cyclist, separated from motorized traffic, appears to be the most effective way to increase perceived supportiveness. Future research should confirm our laboratory findings with experimental on-site research.},

The current qualitative study used `bike-along interviews' with children and parents to allow discussion of detailed environmental factors that may influence children's cycling for transport, while cycling in the participant's neighborhood. Methods Purposeful convenience sampling was used to recruit 35 children and one of their parents residing in (semi-) urban areas. Bike-along interviews were conducted to and from a randomly chosen destination (e.g. library) within a 15 minutes' cycle trip in the participant's neighborhood. Participants wore a GoPro camera to objectively assess environmental elements, which were subsequently discussed with participants. Content analysis and arising themes were derived using a grounded theory approach. Results The discussed environmental factors were categorized under traffic, urban design, cycling facilities, road design, facilities at destination, aesthetics, topography, weather, social control, stranger danger and familiar environment. Across these categories many environmental factors were (in)directly linked to road safety. This was illustrated by detailed discussions of the children's visibility, familiarity with specific traffic situations, and degree of separation, width and legibility of cycle facilities. Conclusion Road safety is of major concern in this 10\textendash 12 yr old study population. Bike-along interviews were able to identify new, detailed and context-specific physical environmental factors which could inform policy makers to promote children's cycling for transport. However, future studies should investigate whether hypothetical changes to such micro environmental features influence perceptions of safety and if this in turn could lead to changes in children's cycling for transport.},

Design Cross-sectional survey Methods Children aged 10\textendash 12 years (n=677) were recruited from 19 schools in Melbourne, Australia. Parents reported the number of walking/cycling trips/week usually made by their child to eight local destinations. Environmental variables (i.e. number of cul-de-sacs, intersections, public open spaces (POS) defined as reserves or parks, sport and recreation POS, sport options, population density, length of busy roads and length of walking/cycling tracks) within an 800m buffer around participants' homes were objectively assessed with a Geographic Information System. Associations between neighbourhood features and frequency of active trips were assessed using multilevel linear regressions. Moderating effects of regular parental accompaniment when walking/cycling were examined. Results Parental co-participation in walking and cycling was positively associated with frequency of overall walking/cycling trips. Number of intersections, sport and recreation POS, sport options and population density were positively associated with walking/cycling trips. Only one significant interaction was found; a positive association was found between intersection density and walking/cycling trips among children whose parents did not cycle with them while it was not associated among others. Conclusions Building supporting and safe neighbourhood environments is needed to support children's active travel behaviours to improve real and perceived safety concerns and provide relevant infrastructure and destinations, regardless of whether or not parents accompany children during walking and cycling. Although little evidence of moderation was found, future research should include co-participation in a broader range of walking behaviours.},

Results Independent mobility was higher among boys compared to girls. Perception of children's cycling and traffic skills and children's grade were positively associated with independent mobility among boys and girls. Perceptions of neighborhood traffic safety were positively associated with independent mobility among girls, but not among boys. Perceptions of cycling skills were positively associated with independent mobility among boys living in high urbanized areas, but not in low urbanized areas. Parental cycling for transport was negatively associated with independent mobility among girls with a low family SES, but not among girls with a high family SES.

Although it is known that the built environment influences children's travel behavior, there is scant knowledge of how urban form along children's commuting routes affects walking and cycling separately, or of how to incorporate urban form exposures in transport mode choice models. This research investigated (a) the associations between children's transport mode choice and urban form correlates en route, and (b) the consequences of different urban form operationalizations (i.e., individual variables, composite measure, and principal components [PCs]). Global Positioning System devices were used to track 623 trips to and from school made by Dutch children aged 6\textendash 11 years. Urban form exposures were derived with geographic information systems, and their relationships with mode choice were tested with mixed multinomial logit models in a cross-sectional research design. Differences between the number of associated urban form variables, their magnitudes, and their significance levels were found for both walking and cycling, independent of the operationalization. Urban form was most influential for walking, whereas distance-related effects were absorbed when modeled as PCs. The highest model fit was achieved through PCs; the composite measure resulted in the lowest fit. To maximize the effectiveness of planning and health interventions, walking and cycling must be targeted separately. Policymakers should avoid ``one-fits-all policies,'' which are deemed to be inefficient. Because urban form affects model interpretation and fit, careful attention should be paid to how urban form is modeled, and sensitivity analyses should be performed.},

Data were drawn from Neighbourhoods for Active Kids, a cross-sectional study of 1085 children aged 8\textendash 13~years between February 2015 and December 2016. School representatives were interviewed regarding their policies and practices related to school travel behaviour and traffic around school, and the data were analysed thematically. An overarching theme, sub-themes and categories were contextualised for quantitative modelling using objectively measured school variables (school socioeconomic status, active school travel programme, built environments around school). Mixed effects multinomial logistic regression models were employed to determine associations between school travel mode and objectively measured child (sociodemographic characteristics, traffic safety perceptions) and school variables. Safety was the core concept of school travel policies, procedures and programmes. Significant differences in child variables, school socioeconomic status, and cycle lanes and traffic lights around school were found between children who actively travelled or used public transport to school and those driven to school. Overall, this study demonstrated the important role of school policy and procedures and the potential application of an intersectoral approach for interventions to support changes in school travel behaviour.},

The association that active commuting has with socio-demographic (gender, school grade, Swedish origin, type of housing, urbanicity in the local area), and socio-economic characteristics (household socio-economic status, family car ownership) was studied using logistic regression, controlling for car ownership and urbanicity, respectively. Results: Active commuting was high (62.9\% in the national sample) but decreased with age\textemdash 76\% at the age of 11 years, 62\% at the age of 13 years and 50\% at the age of 15 years\textemdash whereas public transport increased (19\textendash 43\%). Living in an apartment or row-house (compared with detached house) and living in a medium-sized city (compared with a metropolitan area) was associated with active commuting. In urban areas, active commuting was more common in worker households compared with intermediate- to high-level salaried employees. Conclusion: Active commuting is common but decreases with age. Active commuting differed based on housing and urbanicity but not based on gender or Swedish origin, and impact of socio-economic factors differed depending on level of urbanicity.},

  abstract = {The systematic review investigated the effectiveness of active travel (AT) interventions on physical activity and fitness in primary school children. The review assessed intervention effectiveness, design, complexity, and study quality. Searches were conducted in five databases on 30/08/2018. Studies with an AT intervention compared to an inactive control, in 4 to 11 year olds, measuring AT or fitness outcomes were included. Two-stage screening identified relevant studies. Relevant data were extracted using Cochrane Extraction Form, Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, Active Living by Design model, and intervention Complexity Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews. Meta-analysis and Cohen's D effect size assessed effectiveness. Seventeen eligible studies were included. Effectiveness assessment found a statistically significant standardised mean difference (SMD) in AT outcomes in favour of the intervention (continuous AT - SMD 0.78 (CI 0.11-1.46); frequency AT - SMD 1.87 (CI 0.88-2.86)). Cohen's D calculation concurred with this finding. Fifteen studies had SMD favouring the intervention - two studies had SMD favouring the control. Sixteen studies received a weak quality rating - one study rated moderate. Active travel shows promise in increasing physical activity in primary school children. The review found walking school buses and educational strategies most effective for increasing relevant outcomes, although overall study quality was weak. Effect size did not associate with the complexity of an intervention, therefore supporting efforts to promote active travel through interventions may be easier to scale. Further intervention studies of greater methodological quality are necessary to confirm these findings due to the limited evidence available.},

  abstract = {Active transportation to school (ATS), denoting walking and biking, is crucial to promote physical activity for youth. This study uses data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) to report on the most recent and nationally representative school transportation patterns. Binary logit modeling determines significant factors associated with school travel mode choices. Spatial differences on school mode choices across the US are explored. In 2017 9.6\% of the students of 5\textendash 17~years old usually walked and 1.1\% biked to school. For students who usually walk to school, 77.5\% of their school trips were less than one mile and, among usual bikers to school, 82.8\% of trips were less than two miles. Student rates of walking to school decreased as the distance to school increased and biking rates peaked when distance to school was between 0.5 and 1 miles. When distance to school was {$<$}0.5 miles, walking was the most common mode for urban and rural regions. When the trip was shorter than or equal to one mile, factors such child's school grade, household vehicles per driver, and household income were associated with the decision to walk or bike to school. Other demographic characteristics like race and gender were not significantly related to ATS. While comparison across NHTS years should be viewed with caution due to changes in survey methodology, the decline of ATS rates indicate that more effective and higher reaching efforts for local, regional, and national interventions should be prioritized.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active school transport (AST) is a promising strategy to increase children's physical activity. A systematic review published in 2011 found large heterogeneity in the effectiveness of interventions in increasing AST and highlighted several limitations of previous research. We provide a comprehensive update of that review. METHODS: Replicating the search of the previous review, we screened the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Sport Discus and National Transportation Library databases for articles published between February 1, 2010 and October 15, 2016. To be eligible, studies had to focus on school-aged children and adolescents, include an intervention related to school travel, and report a measure of travel behaviors. We assessed quality of individual studies with the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool, and overall quality of evidence with the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We calculated Cohen's d as a measure of effect size. RESULTS: Out of 6318 potentially relevant articles, 27 articles reporting 30 interventions met our inclusion criteria. Thirteen interventions resulted in an increase in AST, 8 found no changes, 4 reported inconsistent results, and 5 did not report inferential statistics. Cohen's d ranged from -0.61 to 0.75, with most studies reporting "trivial-to-small" positive effect sizes. Three studies reported greater increases in AST over longer follow-up periods and two Safe Routes to School studies noted that multi-level interventions were more effective. Study quality was rated as weak for 27/30 interventions (due notably to lack of blinding of outcome assessors, unknown psychometric properties of measurement tools, and limited control for confounders), and overall quality of evidence was rated as low. Evaluations of implementation suggested that interventions were limited by insufficient follow-up duration, incomplete implementation of planned interventions, and limited access to resources for low-income communities. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions may increase AST among children; however, there was substantial heterogeneity across studies and quality of evidence remains low. Future studies should include longer follow-ups, use standardized outcome measures (to allow for meta-analyses), and examine potential moderators and mediators of travel behavior change to help refine current interventions.

METHOD: We recruited 1699 children (55.0\% girls) in 37 schools stratified by level of urbanization and socioeconomic status in 3 regions of Canada: Ottawa, Trois-Rivi\`eres, and Vancouver. Participants wore a SC-StepRx pedometer for 7 days and completed a validated questionnaire from which we derived a 6-point IM index, the number of AT trips over a week, and the volume of AT to/from school (in kilometer per week). We investigated relationships among measures of IM, AT, and PA employing linear mixed models or generalized linear mixed models adjusted for site, urbanization, and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Each unit increase in IM was associated with 9\% more AT trips, 19\% higher AT volume, and 147 more steps per day, with consistent results across genders. Both measures of AT were associated with marginally higher PA when pooling boys' and girls' data. Children in Vancouver engaged in more AT. PA did not vary across site, urbanization, or socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: IM was associated with more AT and PA regardless of where children lived, underscoring a need for IM interventions.},

The schoolchildren's progression in cycling ability was monitored closely by professional cycling coaches. Fifty-two children (aged 8\textendash 17) at three schools participated. Before and after data on their cycling habits and perceptions of the children and their parents were collected. Children showed clear improvements in their cycling techniques and skills with each session of the cycling training. After the children's training, parents readily felt that cycling training helped to protect cyclists' safety, with three quarters of ``yes'' respondents, and children were in agreement to a lesser magnitude, at around 55\%. Other perceptions of cycling and cycling training were explored as well, with varying results. 24\% of children reported cycling more after training, the majority of those at the introductory level, who had hardly ever cycled prior to training. The results suggest that cycling training has improved schoolchildren's cycling ability, while perceptions and habits of cycling have begun to change as well. These findings can inform future policy direction in the implementation of formalized cycling training for schools situated in high-density cities like Hong Kong primarily to promote cycling for recreation and further as a form of sustainable transport. This needs to go hand in hand with improving neighborhood environments so they become more amenable for active travel especially for vulnerable road users, such as child cyclists.},

  abstract = {Objective Active School Travel (AST) can significantly contribute to children׳s physical activity levels. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate a Canadian School Travel Planning (STP) intervention, by examining child, family, and school-level characteristics that are associated with mode shift from driving to AST one year post-intervention. A secondary objective was to highlight which STP strategies were deemed effective by parents of those children who switched travel modes to AST. Methods Schools (n=103) across Canada participated between January 2010 and March 2012. STP committees implemented strategies to overcome school-specific AST barriers. Mode shift and child/family demographics were assessed by a retrospective, cross-sectional parental survey (n=7827) one year after STP implementation. School level demographics were collected from school administrators. Binomial regression models were applied to examine child, family, and school-level characteristics related to mode shift from driving to AST. Results Approximately 17\% of the sample reported driving less at one-year follow-up both in the morning and afternoon periods. Among these, the majority switched to AST in the morning (n=1002) and afternoon periods (n=995). Results from the regression analyses showed that students in higher elementary grades, living less than 3km from school, attending urban and suburban schools, and attending schools situated in a medium income neighborhood were significantly more likely to change travel mode from driving to AST. Approximately 35\% of parents reported that infrastructure improvements and safety education were the most effective STP strategies. Conclusion The study findings highlight the potential of the STP process in Canada in promoting mode shift from driving to AST. The findings demonstrate STPs may be more effective in some locations where conditions are conducive to mode change. This should inform the development of STP school-selection criteria that may maximize already limited resources by recruiting schools most responsive to STP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The declining prevalence of Active School Transportation (AST) has been accompanied by a decrease in independent mobility internationally. The objective of this study was to compare family demographics and AST related perceptions of parents who let their children walk unescorted to/from school to those parents who escort (walk and drive) their children to/from school. By comparing these groups, insight was gained into how we may encourage greater AST and independent mobility in youth living in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area, Canada. METHODS: This study involved a cross-sectional design, using data from a self-reported questionnaire (n =1,016) that examined parental perceptions and attitudes regarding AST. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to explore the differences between households where children travelled independently to school or were escorted. RESULTS: Findings revealed that unescorted children were: significantly older, the families spoke predominantly English at home, more likely to live within one kilometer from school, and their parents agreed to a greater extent that they chose to reside in the current neighborhood in order for their child to walk to/from school. The parents of the escorted children worried significantly more about strangers and bullies approaching their child as well as the traffic volume around school. CONCLUSIONS: From both a policy and research perspective, this study highlights the value of distinguishing between mode (i.e., walking or driving) and travel independence. For policy, our findings highlight the need for planning decisions about the siting of elementary schools to include considerations of the impact of catchment size on how children get to/from school. Given the importance of age, distance, and safety issues as significant correlates of independent mobility, research and practice should focus on the development and sustainability of non-infrastructure programs that alleviate parental safety concerns.},

Especially for children, active and independent travel can contribute to physical activity, social and motor development, and other health-related outcomes. A reduced number of children engaging in independent mobility over the last 20 years demanded researchers to further examine the construct of children's independent mobility. By examining relevant literature, this narrative review aims to provide the current state of knowledge on children's independent mobility, and identify future directions in research, as well as practical implications. From a public health perspective, considering children's independent mobility in intervention programs is recommended, since it is associated with numerous health and environmental benefits. To develop interventions, multilevel socio-ecological influences on children's independent mobility are widely examined; however, evidence is limited due to heterogeneous measurements and a lack of high-quality prospective studies. To oppose the decline in children's independent mobility, further analysis using comparable measures is needed to understand the determinants of children's independent mobility and to enable international comparison.},

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effects of interventions on girls and boys and to appraise the extent to which previous studies have taken sex/gender into account. Eleven electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials based on a priori defined eligibility criteria. Two independent reviewers screened the literature for eligibility and assessed risk of bias. Semiquantitative analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of intervention effects by taking sex/gender aspects into account. To evaluate sex/gender considerations in interventional studies, a recently developed sex/gender checklist was applied. Twelve studies were included that examined intervention effects on AC in girls and boys. Three intervention studies showed significant effects in increasing AC, with one study favoring girls, one favoring boys, and another focusing on a single sex/gender (only girls). According to the checklist, the overall sex/gender rating highlighted a lack of information in sex/gender consideration. Studies with and without significant effects indicated no differences in the sex/gender checklist. The results indicate that sex/gender is not considered adequately in primary interventional research on AC. To evaluate the effectiveness of intervention in boys and girls, detailed analyses of sex/gender are required, and better reporting about sex/gender-specific intervention content is necessary. In future health research to promote AC, sex/gender should be systematically taken into account.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Children's independent mobility (CIM) is an important contributor to physical activity and health in children. However, in the last 20~years CIM has significantly decreased. To develop effective intervention programs to promote CIM, the impact of the environment on CIM must be identified. This review seeks to provide an overview of sex/gender-specific socio-ecological correlates of CIM. METHODS: A systematic literature search of five databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, Medline, Web of Science) was conducted with a priori defined eligibility criteria and identified 1838 potential articles published between January 1990 and November 2017. Two independent reviewers screened the literature and identified and rated methodological quality of the studies. Related factors of CIM were summarized separately for CIM license (parental permission to travel independently) and CIM destination (destinations to which a child travels independently), and separately for boys and girls using a semi-quantitative method. RESULTS: Twenty-seven peer-reviewed journal articles were identified which examined the relationship between the social and physical environment and CIM. Only seven studies reported results divided by sex/gender. Most associations between the environment and CIM were found in the expected direction (positive or negative) or not associated at all. The social environment seemed to be more influential for ensuring CIM than the physical environment. Neighborhood safety, fear of crime and stranger, parental support, and perception of traffic were important social environmental factors influencing CIM, while car ownership, distance, and neighborhood design were relevant physical environmental attributes. Few studies examined sex/gender-related environmental correlates of independent mobility, and those findings were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review serve as suggestions for intervention programs to increase CIM and to identify future directions in research. To establish a robust comprehension of the impact of the social and physical environment on CIM, further sex/gender-sensitive studies using comparable measurements for CIM and environmental correlates are needed.},

This study used data from the 1977, 1983, 1990, 1995, 2001, and 2009 US National Household Travel Surveys to examine sex differences in school travel and how they have changed over time. The analysis showed that males walked to and from school more than females, though differences were modest \textendash{} between 1\% and 2\% points \textendash{} and were statistically significant only in 1990. In contrast, males biked to school two to three times more than females. These modal differences may result from females' observed lower levels of independent mobility. Policy interventions, such as the Safe Routes to School program, can address gender differences by providing programs such as the Walking School Bus that provide adult supervision on the school trip. Bicycle interventions should ensure that females are participating in the programs.},

  abstract = {Interest in active school transportation has emerged in response to concern over the reduced levels of physical activity (PA) among children. PA derived from active school travel may have important implications for the healthy development of children and youth. This article reviews transportation, urban planning, health and environmental psychology literatures to explore current understanding of school travel behaviour. The major theoretical approaches used to study and explain walking/cycling behaviour were examined; and existing evidence of the influences on school travel outcomes was summarized. Based on this review, the paper outlines a conceptual framework for exploring school travel behaviour of children and youth. The model hypothesizes multiple levels of influence on independent mobility and mode choice for school transportation; independent mobility is conceptualized within the household activity-travel paradigm. Future empirical research based on this framework will inform policy interventions that are focused on children's active mobility and PA.},

A Walking School Bus (WSB) is a relatively new and scarcely evaluated commuting mechanism that in theory provides a creative scheme capable of inspiring voluntary travel behaviour change for children and parents. Through a series of in-depth focus group sessions that were conducted in Bradford, UK this article explores the perceptions of parents that are ultimately the decision-makers about how their children go to school. This work improves the understanding of the different challenges and opportunities underpinning travel to school, in general, and WSBs, in particular, by identifying and discussing six thematic areas of critical importance that explain the decision-making behind potential WSB uptake. These are namely: logistics, safety, trust, health and wellbeing, emotional needs and educational opportunities. Finally, the paper provides policy recommendations about how WSB initiatives can become more effective and attractive mobility tools for local communities.},

This systematic literature provides an update of AST interventions assessing study quality and theory use to examine progress in the field. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify and analyse AST interventions published between 2010 and 2016. Seven databases were searched and exclusion criteria were applied to identify 18 AST interventions. Interventions were assessed using the Active Living by Design (ALBD) Community Action (5P) Model and the Evaluation of Public Health Practice Projects (EPHPP). Methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of each intervention and their outcomes and extent of theory use were examined. RESULTS: Seven out of 18 studies reported theory use. The analysis of the interventions using the ALBD Community Action Model showed that Preparation and Promotion were used much more frequently than Policy and Physical projects. The methodological quality 14 out of 18 included interventions were assessed as weak according to the EPHPP framework. CONCLUSION: Noted improvements were an increase in use of objective measures. Lack of theory, weak methodological design and a lack of reliable and valid measurement were observed. Given that change is evident when theory is used and when policy changes are included extended use of the ALBD model and socio-ecological frameworks are recommended in future.},

This study examines whether attitudes, social support and environmental perceptions are associated with active commuting behaviour in school children and whether these associations are moderated by the distance to school. Methods: Data were collected as part of the SPEEDY study (Sport, Physical activity and Eating behaviour: Environmental Determinants in Young people), a cross-sectional study of 2064 children from schools in Norfolk, UK. Data regarding the usual mode of travel to school, attitudes towards and social support for active commuting, perceptions of the neighbourhood and route to school were assessed using questionnaires completed by 2012 children and their parents. Distance to school was estimated using a Geographic Information System and this was used to compare associations between personal and environmental factors and active travel, across different distance categories. Results: Forty per cent of children reported usually walking to school, with 9\% cycling and the remainder using motorised travel. Parental attitudes and safety concerns, the presence of social support from parents and friends and parent-reported neighbourhood walkability were all found to be predictors of active commuting, with children receiving peer and family support and living in supportive environments being more likely to walk or cycle. There was some evidence of a moderating effect of distance whereby attitudes were more important for short distances and safety concerns long. Conclusion: Both attitudinal and environmental perceptions are associated with children's active commuting behaviours. Given the difficulty in modifying attitudes directly, the effect on them of interventions to provide more supportive environments should be evaluated.},

Using the School Travel Survey, we examined South Carolina school district leaders' perceptions of factors that influence elementary and middle school students walking to school. METHODS: Frequency distributions and chi-square tests were used to analyze the survey responses; open-ended questions were reviewed qualitatively for recurring topics and themes. RESULTS: School and district leaders (N = 314) most often reported street crossing safety (54.0\%) and number of sidewalks (54.0\%) as priority factors that should be addressed to increase students' active travel to school, followed by distance to school (46.0\%), traffic volume (42.4\%), parental attitudes (27.0\%), traffic speed (26.7\%), neighborhood condition (24.4\%), and student attitudes (10.0\%). Several respondents expressed concerns about liability issues related to students' active travel to school while others reported that schools are not responsible for students' safety once students leave school grounds. Independent of their comments about liability, respondents were concerned about the safety of students while walking to school. CONCLUSIONS: Those promoting active travel to school may benefit from addressing those factors perceived as most important by school and district leaders, including street crossing safety, number of sidewalks, and by educating school and district leaders about liability and safety issues related to students walking to school.},

  abstract = {In response to anthropogenic climate change, many governments are adopting policies to reduce carbon emissions. In Canada, federal and provincial governments have implemented carbon pricing. One of the effects of putting a price on carbon is increasing the cost of using private vehicles, which may reduce mobility and increase the risk of social exclusion, especially in contexts where car dependence is high. In this article, we analyse how municipal governments in Canada frame the challenges of climate change and reducing emissions, and examine whether they link these challenges to issues of mobility and social exclusion. Focusing on policies from four of Canada's largest cities \textendash{} Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver \textendash{} we identify four main frames used in planning documents: ``the Growing City'', ``If You Build It, They Will Come'', ``Better City for All'', and ``the Resilient City''. The Growing City frame is used to support status quo urban development, with climate mitigation options (including sustainable travel modes) optionally included for more concerned residents. This is the dominant frame in Calgary, Edmonton, and Winnipeg. Conversely, Vancouver uses the Resilient City frame to indicate that climate mitigation and adaption strategies are essential, and all citizens must be prepared for change. Vancouver presents changes to mobility as necessary for all, rather than an option for some. Social exclusion is not explicitly addressed in the frames, though it is presented as a reason to support building alternative transportation or more public spaces. Social exclusion receives little consideration as a potential consequence of climate mitigation policies.},

The aim of this study was to examine correlates of CIM (8-12 years old) in the Canadian context to inform future interventions. CIM was measured via parent surveys. Individual, social, and environmental correlates of CIM were examined using a social-ecological framework. 1699 participants' data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and gender-stratified linear mixed-effects models while controlling for site, area-level socioeconomic status, and type of urbanization. Individual correlates including child grade ({$\beta$} = 0.612, p {$<$} 0.001), language spoken at home ({$\beta$} = -0.503, p {$<$} 0.001), car ownership ({$\beta$} = -0.374, p {$<$} 0.05), and phone ownership ({$\beta$} = 0.593, p {$<$} 0.001) were associated with CIM. For boys, parental gender ({$\beta$} = -0.387, p {$<$} 0.01) was negatively associated with CIM. Parents' perceptions of safety and environment were significantly associated with CIM. Location (i.e., site) was significantly associated with CIM (ref: Trois-Rivi\`eres; Ottawa ({$\beta$} = -1.188, p {$<$} 0.001); Vancouver ({$\beta$} = -1.216, p {$<$} 0.001)). Suburban environments were negatively associated with boys' independent mobility ({$\beta$} = -0.536, p {$<$} 0.05), while walkability (400 m {$\beta$} = 0.064, p {$<$} 0.05; 1600 m {$\beta$} = -0.059, p {$<$} 0.05) was significantly associated with girls' independent mobility only.

This cross-sectional study estimated associations between the built environment and AST in seven Canadian communities. We observed the travel behaviours of almost 118,000 students at 552 schools. Using beta regression, we modeled the proportion of children using AST, considering built environment and social environment factors around schools. Across all schools, the average proportion of children using AST was 54.3\% (SD 18.9\%), with variability among cities from a low of 39.5\% (SD 22.1\%) in Laval, Quebec to 69.7\% (SD 18.1\%) in Montreal, Quebec. Overall, several modifiable road design features were associated with AST, including the presence of school crossing guards, cycling infrastructure, Walk Score\textregistered{} and traffic signal density. There was variability in the directionality and statistical significance of associations with design variables across cities, suggesting that the local context and directed local interventions are important to support AST. Natural experiment studies are necessary to examine local approaches related to the built environment to increase AST and ensure appropriate new policy and program interventions are developed.},

AST trends are described and a systematic literature review of AST correlates in North America for the period 1990-2016 was conducted. Strength of association between correlates and AST, and relationship direction are assessed and reported. Graphical presentation of correlates included in {$\geq$}5 studies were included. Sixty-three studies were identified and reviewed. Distance to school was most strongly associated with AST. Individual, parental and societal correlates had moderate positive associations with AST including: child age, lower parental education, income and other income related factors, race and positive perceptions of AST. Longitudinal studies were few in number, as were studies about exceptional populations, policy, and interventions. AST intervention should focus on key AST correlates. Social and environmental diversity calls for local solutions to school travel challenges. Changes in AST correlates over time should be considered for evaluating existing policy approaches, and to support development of new policy, regulation, design, and program interventions.},

  abstract = {To meet the recommendation of 60\,min of daily physical activity, children can be encouraged to walk or bike to school, which is known as active school transportation (AST). The aim of this study was to describe parents' attitudes to AST and to explore their experience when implementing interventions to promote it. To explore parent's experiences, we collected pre- and post-intervention data via three questionnaires, using both closed and open questioning techniques. The pre-intervention questionnaire informed development of the intervention. Open-ended questions (pre- and post-) were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. In the intervention, there were 42 children, with 63 parents answering pre-intervention questionnaires and 44 answering a post-intervention questionnaire. The analysis resulted in one main theme: children's motivation and active travel reduces parents' perception of problems, along with three subthemes: parental concerns and suggestions for solutions, children's motivation guides parental choice of transport mode, and trying it changes attitudes. In conclusion, it is beneficial to use the enthusiasm and motivation of children to overcome parental hesitation with AST. In addition, it is critical to acknowledge their concerns, as they are the gatekeepers to the children's use of AST and it is valuable to empower parents when designing relevant interventions. Interventions to increase AST could preferably target changed behavior, and parents' confidence in their children's ability to use active transport in a safe and effective way, vs focusing on changing parental attitudes.},

The paper reports results from a survey in the medium-sized suburban town of L\"unen, Germany. Mode choice of children to and from primary school is studied using multinomial logistic regression. The models include a large variety of variables that capture child and household sociodemographics, parents' mode use, trip distance, parental concerns, attitudes and perceptions, and the built and transport environment. Some of our results confirm previous studies (e.g. on the role of age, gender, and trip distance), while others differ. For instance, we found no effects of household socioeconomic status or of the social environment on mode choice. Concerning the role of the transport environment, we want to highlight two findings. Firstly, narrow pavements along the route increase the odds of being driven rather than walking. Secondly, traffic calming is associated with higher odds of cycling against walking. Parental attitudes and concerns also play a significant role in child mode choice.},

OBJECTIVES: This review synthesized the evidence for associations of independent mobility and active travel to various destinations with physical activity, sedentary behaviour and weight status. DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic search in six databases (PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, SportDiscus, PsychInfo, TRIS) for papers published between January 1990 and March 2012 was undertaken, focussing on children aged 3-18 years. Study inclusion and methodological quality were independently assessed by two reviewers. RESULTS: 52 studies were included. Most studies focussed solely on active travel to and/or from school, and showed significant positive associations with physical activity. The same relationship was detected for active travel to leisure-related places and independent mobility with physical activity. An inverse relationship between active travel to school and weight status was evident but findings were inconsistent. Few studies examined correlations between active travel to school and self-reported screen-time or objectively measured sedentary behaviour, and findings were unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on independent mobility suggested that children who have the freedom to play outdoors and travel actively without adult supervision accumulate more physical activity than those who do not. Further investigation of children's active travel to leisure-related destinations, measurement of diverse sedentary behaviour beyond simply screen-based activities, and consistent thresholds for objectively measured sedentary behaviour in children will clarify the inconsistent evidence base on associations of active travel with sedentary behaviour and weight status.},

The potential benefits for children are significant such as social interactions with peers, spatial and traffic safety skills and increased physical activity. Yet, the health benefits of independent mobility, particularly on physical activity accumulation, are largely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate associations of children's independent mobility with light, moderate-to-vigorous, and total physical activity accumulation. METHODS: In 2011-2012, 375 Australian children aged 8-13 years (62\% girls) were recruited into a cross-sectional study. Children's independent mobility (i.e. independent travel to school and non-school destinations, independent outdoor play) and socio-demographics were assessed through child and parent surveys. Physical activity intensity was measured objectively through an Actiheart monitor worn on four consecutive days. Associations between independent mobility and physical activity variables were analysed using generalized linear models, accounting for clustered sampling, Actiheart wear time, socio-demographics, and assessing interactions by sex. RESULTS: Independent travel (walking, cycling, public transport) to school and non-school destinations were not associated with light, moderate-to-vigorous and total physical activity. However, sub-analyses revealed a positive association between independent walking and cycling (excluding public transport) to school and total physical but only in boys (b\,=\,36.03, p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Frequent independent outdoor play (three or more days per week) was positively associated with light and total physical activity (b\,=\,29.76, p\,{$<$}\,0.01 and b\,=\,32.43, p\,=\,0.03, respectively). No significant associations were found between independent outdoor play and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. When assessing differences by sex, the observed significant associations of independent outdoor play with light and total physical activity remained in girls but not in boys. All other associations showed no significant differences by sex. CONCLUSIONS: Independent outdoor play may boost children's daily physical activity levels, predominantly at light intensity. Hence, facilitating independent outdoor play could be a viable intervention strategy to enhance physical activity in children, particularly in girls. Associations between independent travel and physical activity are inconsistent overall and require further investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In developed countries, children's independent mobility levels are low. Built environmental factors and parental safety concerns are well-known to predict the level of independent mobility adults grant to children. In contrast, the influence of adults' socio-demographic characteristics and neighbourhood social cohesion on children's independent mobility is largely unexplored. This study investigated the influence of adults' socio-demographic factors and neighbourhood social cohesion on distances they would permit children for independent travel and outdoor play. METHODS: In 2013, a random sample of 1293 Australian adults (mean age: 56.1 years, 52 \% male, 81 \% parents) participated in the Queensland Social Survey (QSS) via computer-assisted telephone interview. Socio-demographic factors measured included age, sex, parental status, education and area-level socio-economic disadvantage. Perceived neighbourhood social cohesion was assessed using a standardised scale. Adults reported the distances children aged 8-12 years should be allowed to walk/cycle to places, and play outdoors without adults. Responses were categorised into 'within sight', {$<$} 0.5 kilometres (km) , 0.5-1 km and {$>$}1 km. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess associations of socio-demographic factors and neighbourhood social cohesion with distances adults would permit for children's independent travel and outdoor play. RESULTS: Parents and adults with lower education were less likely to permit greater distances for children's independent travel (OR 0.57 and OR = 0.59, respectively). Women, parents and adults with lower education were less likely to grant children greater distances for independent outdoor play (OR = 0.61, OR = 0.50 and OR = 0.60, respectively). In contrast, adults with higher perceptions of neighbourhood social cohesion were more likely to permit children greater distances for independent travel (OR = 1.05)and outdoor play (OR = 1.05). Adult age and area-level socio-economic disadvantage were not associated with distances adults would permit for independent travel and outdoor play. CONCLUSIONS: Women, parents (particularly those of younger children), adults with lower education and those who perceived neighbourhood social cohesion as being lower were less willing to let children independently travel further away from home. Interventions to increase children's independent mobility may be more effective if targeted to these groups. In addition, increasing neighbourhood social cohesion may help increase adults' willingness to grant children greater independent mobility.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Promoting cycling to school may benefit establishing a lifelong physical activity routine. This systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence on strategies and effects of school-based interventions focusing on increasing active school transport by bicycle. METHODS: A literature search based on "PICo" was conducted in eight electronic databases. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials with primary/secondary school students of all ages were included that conducted pre-post measurements of a school-based intervention aimed at promoting active school travel by bicycle and were published in English between 2000 and 2019. The methodological quality was assessed using the "Effective Public Health Practice Project" tool for quantitative studies. Applied behavior change techniques were identified using the "BCT Taxonomy v1". Two independent researchers undertook the screening, data extraction, appraisal of study quality, and behavior change techniques. RESULTS: Nine studies investigating seven unique interventions performed between 2012 and 2018 were included. All studies were rated as weak quality. The narrative synthesis identified 19 applied behavior change techniques clustered in eleven~main groups according to their similarities and a variety of 35 different outcome variables classified into seven main groups. Most outcomes were related to active school travel and psychosocial factors, followed by physical fitness, physical activity levels, weight status, active travel and cycling skills. Four studies, examining in total nine different outcomes, found a significant effect in favor of the intervention group on bicycle trips to school (boys only), percentage of daily cycling trips to school, parental/child self-efficacy, parental outcome expectations, moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (total, from cycling, before/after school), and total basic cycling skills. Seven of these outcomes were only examined in two studies conducting the same intervention in children, a voluntary bicycle train to/from school accompanied by adults, including the following clustered main groups of behavior change techniques: shaping knowledge, comparison of behavior, repetition and substitution as well as antecedents. CONCLUSIONS: The applied strategies in a bicycle train intervention among children indicated great potential to increase cycling to school. Our findings provide relevant insights for the design and implementation of future school-based interventions targeting active school transport by bicycle. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This systematic review has been registered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews "PROSPERO" at (registration number: CRD42019125192 ).},

  abstract = {Children's independent mobility (CIM) is considered as a determining criterion of child-friendly built environment (BE). Researchers have made a substantial effort to identify the characteristics of the BE that affect CIM and thereby to inform city policy to promote CIM. Although the findings from these studies are useful to inform context specific CIM policy, together they provide inconclusive results. This study made a first attempt to draw a generalised conclusion through a meta-analysis of existing knowledge base. The analysis was conducted using primary studies reporting 13 BE-CIM links and published between 1980 and 2016. Overall effect size (ES), directions, and consistency of each link were calculated, also stratified by contexts, using the reported results from the primary studies and based on a random effect model. The results show that four BE factors (dead-end street, \% of residential land, \% of commercial land, and residential location type) have a positive association with CIM; traffic volume has a neutral association; and the remaining eight factors (vehicular street width, road density, intersection density, major road proportion, land use mix, availability of recreational facilities, residential density, and distance to destination) have a negative association. Living in a dead end street was found to have the strongest positive ES (0.352), with moderate level of consistency across the primary studies. In contrast, land use mix has the strongest negative ES (-0.212) but with the highest level of inconsistency. Both ESs and consistencies, however, vary between developing and developed country contexts. Diversity in contexts, research design, and measurement instruments across the primary studies contributed to the heterogeneous results. The findings of this research serve as a guide for practitioners and researcher alike to make an informed decision about the BE factors that consistently foster or hinder CIM in different contexts.},

This mixed methods study investigates whether parent perceptions of the neighbourhood environment align with objective measures of the neighbourhood built environment, and how perceived and objective measures relate to parental licence for children's independent mobility. Parents participating in the Neighbourhood for Active Kids study (n = 940) answered an open-ended question about what would make their neighbourhoods better for their child's independent mobility, and reported household and child demographics. Objective measures of the neighbourhood built environment were generated using geographic information systems. Content analysis was used to classify and group parent-reported changes required to improve their neigbourhood. Parent-reported needs were then compared with objective neighbourhood built environment measures. Linear mixed modelling examined associations between parental licence for independent mobility and (1) parent neighbourhood perceptions; and (2) objectively assessed neighbourhood built environment features. Parents identified the need for safer traffic environments. No significant differences in parent reported needs were found by objectively assessed characteristics. Differences in odds of reporting needs were observed for a range of socio-demographic characteristics. Parental licence for independent mobility was only associated with a need for safer places to cycle (positive) and objectively assessed cycling infrastructure (negative) in adjusted models. Overall, the study findings indicate the importance of safer traffic environments for children's independent mobility.},

Across the last generation, children's physical activity and screen viewing behaviours have changed, coinciding with changes to the home and neighbourhood environment. This study aimed to qualitatively explore parents' views on their 8{$^-$}9-year-old child's childhood and how this compares to experiences from their own childhood, with a specific focus on physical activity and screen viewing behaviours. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 51 parents (mean age = 41.2 years, range 31.5 to 51.5 years), between July and October 2016. Inductive and deductive content analyses were used to explore parents' perceptions of their child's physical activity and screen viewing behaviours in comparison to their own childhood behaviours. Interview data revealed that compared to the relative freedom they recalled as children, parents restrict their children's independent mobility and outdoor play due to concerns about safety. Despite their children having greater access to structured activities than they did as children, parents feel their children are "missing out," and perceived their own childhood as better with regards to maximising independent and outdoor play and limiting screen viewing. Innovative strategies are needed to change the social norms surrounding children's independent mobility and outdoor play.},

Methods: Cross-sectional study of 235 children aged 5 to 6 years and 677 children aged 10 to 12 years from 19 elementary schools in Melbourne, Australia. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by parents, and the older children. The shortest possible routes to school were examined using a geographic information system. Results: Among both age groups, negative correlates of active commuting to school included parental perception of few other children in the neighborhood and no lights or crossings for their child to use, and an objectively assessed busy road barrier en route to school. In younger children, an objectively assessed steep incline en route to school was negatively associated with walking or cycling to school. Good connectivity en route to school was negatively associated with walking or cycling to school among older children. Among both age groups, children were more likely to actively commute to school if their route was {$<$}800 meters. There were no associations with perceived energy levels or enjoyment of physical activity, weight status, or family factors. Conclusions: For children, creating child-friendly communities and providing skills to safely negotiate the environment may be important.

  abstract = {Introduction An increasing number of studies in transportation research have recently focused on well-being and travel satisfaction. These studies argue that satisfaction with travel is an indicator of the trip's contribution to subjective wellbeing of the traveler. Although the attention on satisfaction with travel is increasing, relatively few studies have considered satisfaction with travel of children. As children's travel is strongly linked to distance and the built environment, they would be important additional considerations to such research. Therefore, this study looks into the household, built environment and trip characteristics influencing satisfaction with travel and mood among Dutch children attending primary school. Additionally, the study considers the mediating effect of parental safety perception on satisfaction with travel and the relationship between satisfaction with travel and mood. Methods In order to study these relationships, survey data were collected in the Netherlands from 660 children (7\textendash 12 years) and their parents. The data were analyzed using a path analysis. Results Findings show that parental safety perceptions are related to the age of the child, income, perceptions of neighborhood infrastructure and social cohesion. Satisfaction with school travel is higher when parental safety perception is higher, when it is sunny, when traveling with a friend and when traveling by bike when this is the favorite transport mode. Satisfaction with travel is related to children reporting a better mood. Conclusion These insights can be used by policy makers to create safe school environments stimulating active travel, which in turn will improve satisfaction with travel, well-being and health among primary school-going children.},

  abstract = {Studies on school travelling frequently deal with active travelling that is considered important in preventing obesity. Most research has been done in low bicycle countries where walking is the main active mode. The paper presents an analysis for the Netherlands and Flanders, two European countries with high bicycle use. The study analyses two aspects of school travel behaviour: home-to-school distances and modal choice. Both are analysed for primary and secondary school students. A descriptive analysis learns that in Flanders trip lengths to primary schools are significantly larger than in the Netherlands and that the bicycle is more frequently used in the Netherlands. Analyses of influencing variables for both home-to-school distance and modal choice demonstrate that `hard' factors that define the objective conditions for school choice (crucial for home-to-school distance) and modal choice are most influential. They regard the locations of eligible schools and the qualities of the eligible modes. Just one other factor is significant in the explanation of home-to-school distances: car ownership. On the other hand, modal choice is influenced by several other socio-cultural factors, where age of the pupil, size of the household, and car ownership are most important. Most outcomes are in line with other studies. The observed high bicycle use demonstrates that the bicycle has the potential to account for a large number of trips and can even be the dominant mode in school travelling.},

  abstract = {Associations between access to local destinations and children's independent mobility (IM) were examined. In 2007, 10- to 12-year-olds (n = 1,480) and their parents (n = 1,314) completed a survey. Children marked on a map the destinations they walked or cycled to (n = 1,132), and the availability of local destinations was assessed using Geographic Information Systems. More independently mobile children traveled to local destinations than other children. The odds of IM more than halved in both boys and girls whose parents reported living on a busy road (boys, OR = 0.48; girls, OR = 0.36) and in boys who lived near shopping centers (OR = 0.18) or community services (OR = 0.25). Conversely, the odds of IM more than doubled in girls living in neighborhoods with well-connected low-traffic streets (OR = 2.32) and increased in boys with access to local recreational (OR = 1.67) and retail (OR = 1.42) destinations. Creating safe and accessible places and routes may facilitate children's IM, partly by shaping parent's and children's feelings of safety while enhancing their confidence in the child's ability to use active modes without an adult.},

  abstract = {Children's independent mobility (IM), their freedom to move about their neighbourhood without supervision by adults, has been in steady decline in recent decades. Previous research has linked perceptions of the environment with various measures of IM, but recently concerns have been raised regarding inconsistency in measuring IM. This study used various measures of IM and aimed to address how parental perceptions of the neighbourhood environment are associated with children's territorial range (actual IM), as well as how this relationship is mediated by IM parenting practices (allowed IM). A sample of 105 child/parent dyads from Vancouver, Canada participated in this study. Children (age 10-13) wore a global positioning system (GPS) watch and an accelerometer and completed an activity diary for seven days to assess their territorial range. Parents completed a questionnaire that assessed perceptions of their neighbourhood environment and IM parenting practices-license for IM and roaming allowance. Path analyses were used to address the research aims. License for IM and roaming allowance mediated the relationship between perceived walking facilities, crime safety, and neighbourhood relations and children's territorial range. Findings suggest that future interventions to increase children's territorial range should focus primarily on attitude and behaviour change among parents to grant children more freedom.},

  abstract = {Japan has had considerable success in maintaining high levels of children walking to school compared to other wealthy nations. To begin, this chapter will use national travel data to paint a general picture of children's (aged 5\textendash 17) travel in Japan. Evidence related to the high levels of independent travel are then summarized. Results from a recent study will discuss the relationships between what children do during their trips and their satisfaction with their travel as a measure of psychological wellbeing. Finally, there will be discussion on previous research that has highlighted the importance of walking and independent travel for incidental social interactions as a measure of social well-being, which are occurrences that are particularly frequent in Japan. Having set the scene, the chapter will then discuss a number of reasons to help explain children's travel in Japan. This includes planning, regulations, and community solutions to support walking to school. A number of social practices that help maintain high levels of children's autonomy are discussed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical activity plays a fundamental role in the health and well-being of children. Walking is the most common form of physical activity and the journey to and from school provides an opportunity for children to be active every day. This study examines how child and parent perceptions of barriers to active school travel influences children's behaviour. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 48 elementary schools in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The study sample includes 1296 children (ages 9-14~years) who live within walking distance of their school, defined as 1.6~km network distance. Chi-square analysis examined differences between child and parent perceptions of barriers to active school travel. Logistic regression models examined how parent and child perceptions of barriers influence active school travel behaviour, while controlling for key intrapersonal, interpersonal, and physical environment factors. RESULTS: The results indicate that there are significant differences in how parents and children perceive barriers to active school travel. Model results find older children, children without siblings, households with no vehicles, and children who live closer to school are most likely to use active school travel. Parent perceptions of barriers are found to have a greater influence on children's active school travel behaviour than children's perceptions. Different perceptions of barriers influence active school travel to school compared to returning home from school. CONCLUSIONS: Child and parent perceptions of barriers to active school travel differ and have different impacts on children's travel behaviour. Understanding how child and parent perceptions of barriers differ can help policymakers and practitioners develop specialized interventions aimed at increasing children's use of active school travel and children's overall physical activity. Interventions used to promote active school travel should focus on safety, as well as perceptions of distance to break parental habits of routinely driving their children to school. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering both child and parent perceptions to create a safe and accessible environment to allow for an increase in active school travel behaviour among elementary school children who live within walking distance of their school.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Independent travel among youth has diminished and rates of obesity have increased. It remains empirically unclear what factors influence the degree to which parents allow, or even enable, their children to be independently mobile. We analyze the association between parental perceptions of the social environment and the degree of independent mobility among children. METHODS: Surveys were conducted with 305 parents of 10- to 14-year-olds in the Bay Area during 2006 and 2007. The social environment was measured with scales assessing parental perceptions of child-centered social control, intergenerational closure, social cohesion, and safety from crime and traffic. Independent mobility was measured as a composite variable reflecting the degree to which a child is allowed to do the following without adult accompaniment: travel to neighborhood destinations, walk around the neighborhood, cross main roads, and ride transit. RESULTS: We find modest evidence of an association between parental perceptions of social cohesion and safety from traffic and independent mobility outcomes among children. Age is positively associated with increased independent mobility and Hispanic children experience greater restrictions on independent mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions aimed at increasing physical activity among children through greater independent mobility should include neighborhood-level efforts to grow social cohesion and trust.},

  abstract = {Active and Safe Routes to School (ASRTS) is a national program to increase active travel by children on the home-school journey and thereby to improve health, traffic safety, air quality and community connections. Peterborough's ASRTS Research Project (situated in Ontario, Canada) is an innovative partnership linking a public health department, an environmental non-profit organization and an academic geographer to conduct school-community transportation studies. The research project described here involved transportation studies carried out at ten schools by geography students in co-operation with parents and schools. The results were shared with school councils, school boards, community organizations and municipal transportation planners. The project offered university students an opportunity for community-based research while increasing the capacity of the partner organizations. The school transportation studies provided local data that promoted consideration of child transportation issues in the City's Transportation Master Plan Update (2002). This paper examines the evolution, contributions, and challenges of the ASRTS partnership and how it could expand and attract allies such as urban planners.},
