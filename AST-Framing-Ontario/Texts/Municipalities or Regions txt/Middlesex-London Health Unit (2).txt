Active Transportation
Active transportation (AT) is any form of human powered transportation that gets you to and from work, school,
shopping, appointments, recreation, visiting friends, etc.1 In other words, AT is ‘physical activity’ with ‘purpose’. Walking
and cycling are the most popular forms of AT and are often combined with other travel modes such as public transit.



The Problem…
Physical activity is good for health at all ages yet only 22% of
Canadian adults achieve the recommended amount of 150
minutes per week and 9% of children & youth achieve the
recommended 60 minutes per day according to the Canadian
Guidelines.2,3


Active Transportation can be part of the
solution!
Active transportation is a way to make physical activity a
regular part of everyday life. It is also good for mental health,
overall well-being, safety, the environment and the economy.4,5

Active & Safe Routes to School (ASRTS)
ASRTS is a community partnership across Elgin, Oxford and
Middlesex Counties and the cities of London and St. Thomas.
They work together to encourage children and families to
choose active transportation.

School Travel Planning (STP) is their primary program that
encourages active transportation to and from school by
developing an action plan to build upon strengths and work to
remove concerns around the school.


Community Design & Active
Transportation

The design of neighbourhood streets, buildings and facilities can influence everyday transportation choices. Active
community design makes it easier for people of all ages and abilities to live active lifestyles. Find out how to design a
healthy community:

      Neighbourhoods

      Transportation
      Public Spaces

The Ontario Professional Planners Institute calls for widespread action to implement an active transportation (PDF)
system that prioritizes a complete streets approach for all road users when it comes to road design and community
development.




   Get moving with Active Transportation as part of a healthy lifestyle!
