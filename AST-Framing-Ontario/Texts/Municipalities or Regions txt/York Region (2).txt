Active Transportation
Going Somewhere? Go Active!

Using active modes of transportation is a great way to be active throughout the day. Active transportation
improves our health and the health of our communities. Being active also lowers our healthcare costs by
increasing the number of people who choose to walk or bike, which in turn can help our population with
attaining a healthy body weight, a reduction in heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes.

Cycling and walking also make our roads safer by reducing congestion and the number of conflicts that occur
by overcrowded streets. Furthermore, active transportation increases eyes on the street for enhanced
neighborhood safety.
