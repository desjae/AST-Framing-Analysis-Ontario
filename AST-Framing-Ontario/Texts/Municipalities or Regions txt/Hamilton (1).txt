      School Travel Plan

Active and Sustainable School Travel Certification
The Active and Sustainable School Travel (ASST) certification process uses the Canadian School Travel Planning model to
help schools earn recognition for ASST efforts.

School Travel Planning is a community-based approach that aims to increase the number of students and adults choosing
active and sustainable travel to get to and from school. This approach addresses concerns about safety, physical activity,
and the environment.

Key community stakeholders (school boards, municipalities, police, public health professionals, parents/guardians,
administrators, educators and children) work together to identify and to solve their school travel needs.

Create a School Travel Plan
Through a five-step process, each school writes a School Travel Plan with input and assistance from community
stakeholders. Each School Travel Plan (STP) includes an action plan describing steps they plan to implement such as:

   School infrastructure improvements e.g. Bike racks and shelters
   Education e.g. Safety training for walking and cycling, awareness raising
   Community mobilization e.g. Walking school buses, walking buddies, ride sharing
   Encouragement e.g. Celebrations of physical activity and environment, event days, recognition and rewards for
   walking/biking
   Engineering improvements at or near school sites e.g. pedestrian crossings, adult crossing guards, repairs/upgrades to
   sidewalks, signage

Apply for ASST Certification
Schools are encouraged to apply for ASST Certification. There are two levels of certification:

   Level 1: Steps one through three completed
   Level 2: Steps four and five completed. Recipients are designated as bronze, silver, or gold in relation to the number
   and intensity of actions completed.


 Parent Engagement Strategy
 Would your school like to…

    Make it easier to walk or wheel to and from school?
    Reduce the number of vehicles around your school at drop-off and pick-up times?
    Increase the number of physically active students, families, and staff?
    Improve air quality and safety?

 If yes, then you need to get involved with Active & Sustainable School Travel (ASST) - Parent Engagement Strategy.

 For more information, contact faye.parascandalo@hamilton.ca.

 Objectives of the strategy are to increase:

    Parental/caregivers’ awareness about the importance of ASST.
    Number of parents/caregivers engaged in ASST initiatives, including encouraging their child’s active travel.
    Parental/caregiver capacity to become ASST leaders/champions.
