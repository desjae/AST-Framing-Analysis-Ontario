 Active Transportation Master Plan
 The City's first Active Transportation Master Plan – branded as Walk ‘n' Roll Kingston – outlines a roadmap for               Hours:
 investment in active transportation infrastructure and engagement with residents to facilitate modal transformation.          Monday to Friday - 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
 The plan reflects the city's unique built form, road network, land use, density, green space, culture, history and key
 features, including its waterfront, public priorities, strategic objectives and future vision.

 Walk 'n' Roll Kingston is informed by public and stakeholder input, the City's strategic objectives and a vision: to

 investment in infrastructure, supportive programs, resources and staff from the City and its partners. This plan sets
 out a blueprint for staff, decision makers and stakeholders to better understand, plan, design, and implement active          Related Documents
