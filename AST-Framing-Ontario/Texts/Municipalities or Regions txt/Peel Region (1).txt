ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IN K-8 PEEL SCHOOLS
HOME(HTTPS://TRCA.CA/) » ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IN K-8 PEEL SCHOOLS
Are you a parent living in the Region of Peel, with children in kindergarten to grade 8? Use the active transportation resources on this page to get
moving to and from school in healthy and active ways!
We encourage teachers to take advantage of these resources too! You can use them in class and share with students and their families.
What is Active Transportation?
Active transportation means using people power to get where you’re going!
You can use your feet, bike, scooter, or any other form of non-motorized vehicle to get you to your destination.
Did You Know?
Active transportation …
                 Helps to promote well-being and positive mental health, including reducing day-to-day stress.
                 Increases physical tness/activity, including helping to lower risks of chronic disease such as obesity and/or diabetes.
                 Increases the ability to learn, improves concentration, and helps your children do better in school.
                 Helps to reduce traf c congestion in and around school zones, which means safer streets for everyone.
                 Helps to reduce your climate impact and the harmful effects of air pollution.
Make Active Transportation Your #1 Choice
                 Make walking or rolling to school your rst choice!
                 If it were up to the kids, they would choose walking or rolling to school as their rst choice. Why not make it yours too? Even if your
                 school is far from home, students can walk to the bus stop! Consider different ways a pick-up or drop-off routine could include stepping
                 out of your car and completing your journey to school by walking or rolling.
                 Plan and practice!
                 As a household you can begin to practice your route to school together. You can also encourage children to walk or roll on their own,
                 with siblings or friends, depending on their age and maturity.
