   As part of plans to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the City is making temporary
   road and sidewalk changes so people walking and cycling can stay 2 metres apart. The
   map shows the locations and the temporary changes at each site.

Active transportation in Guelph
When Guelph’s active transportation network is complete in 2027, it will connect the city from north to south and east to west on a 54-km
network of mostly o -road paths and trails. People of all ages and abilities will be able to use the network all year round.

Walk to School
The City of Guelph is a partner in the Wellington Du erin Active and Safe Routes to School Committee (ASRTS). Partners include:


      The Upper Grand District School Board
      Wellington Catholic District School Board

      Wellington Du erin Public Health
      Student Transportation Services Wellington Du erin


The vision of the Committee is that walking, cycling and other active modes will be attractive, realistic and safe modes of transportation for
school students.

For their health, safety, environment and community


      Kids learn healthy habits and concentrate better in class.
      One less car (yours) reduces tra c and parking problems in school zones.
      Teach your kids about tra c safety.
      Start a walking school bus; your kids make friends in every grade, and that can prevent bullying.

Adding sidewalks
We’re adding new sidewalks every year based on Guelph’s sidewalk needs assessment study. The study reviewed guidelines for sidewalk
construction, explored municipal best practices, developed criteria for ranking locations for new sidewalks, proposed an implementation
strategy and cost estimate for completing the sidewalk network.
