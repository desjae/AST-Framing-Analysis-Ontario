the variables. Results show that car ownership, poor walking/cycling environment, and adults' convenience for
escorting students signi<U+FB01>cantly stimulate the use of cars in school commuting. Students are more inclined to
choose cars when their departure time is at rush hour compared to the other time. Moreover, the longer distance
encourages the use of motorized transport, where the households with local hukou (usually related to the car
ownership and other welfares) are more willing to drive their children to school. A number of recommendations
on car restraint, sustainable travel environment improvement, di<U+FB00>erent working hour implementing, and edu-
cational resources layout for the encouragement and promotion of sustainable travel practices are lastly pro-
posed.

adults and children in the household, etc.), and the interaction between
the household members. The work conducted by Ermagun and Samimi
(2015) pointed out that both household income and car ownership were
recognized in school trip active modes of transportation utilization. Li
and Zhao (2015) found that students from low-income households in-
cline to walk rather than use the bicycle, and students from households
with private cars are more likely to be driven to school in China. Some
recent systematic reviews consider the relationship between school
travel mode and household structure. It was identi<U+FB01>ed that students
from families with unemployed parents will tend to walk (Kelly and Fu,
2014), and students having siblings were found to be associated with
higher rates of walking and biking (McDonald, 2008b). Moreover, Mitra
and Buliung (2014) put forward that students were more likely to be
driven to school when their mothers were available at home during the
school runs, while the absence of an adult caregiver led to the increase
of probability of walking, taking transit.

2.3. Built environment

Social and environmental level-factors also have been discussed
more generally, including the travel distance between home and school,
urban form, transportation infrastructure, social norms. Aiming at the
students at primary school in Ireland, Kelly and Fu (2014) concluded
that travel distance to school is the most signi<U+FB01>cant determinant of
school travel choice, and it is observed that 2 km is a guiding ‘splitting
line’ between the active travel modes and motorized modes. In another
study, home distance of 1.5 km from school is identi<U+FB01>ed as the
threshold for Canadian students to change from driving to alternative
modes of walking or biking (Mammen et al., 2014). Easton and Ferrari
(2015) found the small but signi<U+FB01>cant correlations between school
commuting distance and urban form, and underscored that students
who lived closer to school with high cul-de-sacs (no-through roads)
density, were more likely to engage in active commuting when taking
account of distance and urban form variable together. Moreover, in the
study of Broberg and Sarjala (2015), it is shown that the increases of
urban form related variables like the density of major roads, residential
density, building use mix decreased the likelihood of engaging in
walking or cycling among students in Finland. As far as transportation
infrastructure, Kamargianni et al. (2015) stated that transport network
characteristics like the availability of bicycle paths, bicycle parking
spaces, sidewalks' width signi<U+FB01>cantly a<U+FB00>ected the school travel mode
choice of active transport. Lang et al. (2011) mentioned the role of
social norms in students' school travel behavior. When the majority of
people act in a certain manner, it may be perceived as a sagacious way
to proceed. In order to decrease the share of driving to school, it is
suggested to make a social norm that large numbers of students walk/
cycle to school. Under the China's context, Li and Zhao (2015) men-
tioned that students in Beijing of China living near the inner city are
more likely to cycle to school due to the more diversity of land use and
better jobs-housing balance.

2.4. Parental concerns

Parental concerns on safety, comfort, reliability and convenience
have been shown to a<U+FB00>ect their children's mode choice in school trips.
The study conducted by Ermagun et al. (2015a) provided evidence that
parents who were concerned about travel safety persisted on escorting
their children. And such parents preferred private cars and school bus
service for their children's school travel. Ermagun and Levinson
(2016b) revealed that parents who were concerned about the comfort
of their children preferred to use school bus and private car. Parents
who were concerned about the reliability of the travel mode preferred
the school bus. Ermagun et al. (2015b) stated that parents who were
concerned about their child's convenience preferred to drop their
children o<U+FB00> themselves or use school bus service. Parents who were
anxious about their children's safety were not willing to let their

children walk or use public transit.
This study focuses on the school travel mode choice behavior of
students in Beijing, China, which has not been paid much attention on
an academic and policy level. The contribution of this paper to the
current literature lies in two aspects.
First, the traditional methods usually include descriptive methods
and parametric regression methods (such as linear regression model,
logit-based model, etc.), but these methods have their own dis-
advantage in data analysis. For example, the descriptive methods can
identify in<U+FB02>uencing factors on the basis of statistical descriptions only,
while parametric regression methods are employed to determine the
average e<U+FB00>ect of an independent variable on a dependent variable
without considering the special requirements of population subgroups
when interventions are developed from model results (Lemon et al.,
2003). With regard to the classi<U+FB01>cation for continuous variables, most
parametric regression models are usually dependent on intuitions or the
results of descriptive statistics, the impacts of in<U+FB02>uencing factors may
be exaggerated or downgraded due to the unreasonable classi<U+FB01>cation.
In comparison, decision tree is a nonparametric statistics method,
which is usually used to population classi<U+FB01>cation based on the Chi-
square signi<U+FB01>cance test. The root node represents the dependent vari-
able, and the parent nodes and child nodes are generated based on their
Chi-square signi<U+FB01>cances. The higher the Chi-square signi<U+FB01>cance of the
independent variable is, the earlier the classi<U+FB01>cation variable it will be.
Given decision tree has the ability to easily segment populations into
meaningful subgroups, without the need of a speci<U+FB01>ed functional form
and the assumption of additivity of predictors. Therefore, this paper
will develop a framework incorporating both tree-based regression
method and logit-based regression method to formulate more realistic
and richer behavioral representations of the underlying decision pro-
cesses.
Second, there are many di<U+FB00>erences of economic and social settings
between Western countries and China, such as the level of economic
development, urban form, admissions policy, hukou institution, and the
culture context, etc. There has only been one study in China examining
determinants of commuting mode choice among school children (Li and
Zhao, 2015), which aims at the school travel of students aged 13–15 in
Beijing, on the basis of the data collected in 2005. However, only a few
of factors are taken into consideration. In comparison, this study has
explored the school travel mode choice of 7–18 year-old students in
Beijing from primary school to middle school, and to high school. As we
all known, students in these three stages have di<U+FB00>erent school travel
patterns. For example, primary school students have a totally di<U+FB00>erent
travel behavior due to their high level of dependency compared to older
students (McMillan, 2005). The extending of research objective is
helpful to capture the characteristics of di<U+FB00>erent age-stage students on
school travel mode choice, and further help the society comprehen-
sively understand Chinese students' school travel mode choice in
Beijing. Moreover, the data used in this study are from the Fifth Travel
Survey of Beijing Inhabitants in 2014, which provides the most recent
travel survey data representative of the whole city by far. As a matter of
fact, it is universally recognized that China has achieved extraordinary,
sustained growth over the past decades in political, economic and
cultural <U+FB01>elds. With the rapid expansion of Beijing city, as well as the
fast-growing population, the stale data can no longer re<U+FB02>ect students'
school travel behavior under the current urban development pattern. In
order to supplement the understanding of students' school commuting
behavior in the context of a developing country, especially for China,
based on the most recent travel survey data representative of Beijing,
more comprehensive and special factors related to student's character-
istics, households' characteristics, built environment and parental con-
cerns will be included in this study framework.

capital city and the political and cultural communication center of
China, Beijing has experienced the rapid growth of economy and wit-
nessed the fast expansion of urban area in recent years.
Based on the latest administrate divisions, Beijing can be divided
into four functional zones: 1) core functional zone, which is char-
acterized by the political and cultural functions of the whole city, in-
cluding the districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng; 2) urban function ex-
tended zone, which is the representative area of high technology
industries and educational institutions, including the districts of
Chaoyang, Fengtai, Shijingshan and Haidian; 3) new urban develop-
ment zone, which is the carrier of modern manufacturing or agri-
cultural industries, including the districts of Fangshan, Tongzhou,
Shunyi, Changping and Daxing; (4) ecological conservation zone, which
is the ecological barrier and plays the key role in sustainable develop-
ment of Beijing, including the districts of Mentougou, Huairou, Pinggu,
Miyun and Yanqing (Peng et al., 2016b). As shown in Fig. 1, the po-
pulation density (Beijing Statistical Yearbook, 2015) decreases drama-
tically when the physical distance to the inner city increases. This un-
ique urban expansion spatial pattern makes it interesting to discover
how the social and environmental level-factors in Beijing in<U+FB02>uence
students' school commuting mode.
According to the Beijing Statistical Yearbook (2015), the registered
students in primary school, middle and high schools of Beijing are
821,000, 474,000 and 178,000 respectively. And the corresponding
enrollment rates are 99.8%, 103.5% and 86.5%, indicating that the
coverage of elementary and secondary education in Beijing is relatively
higher. Given the reality mentioned above, it can be inferred that stu-
dents' school commuting is an important component of tra<U+FB03>c <U+FB02>ow
during the rush hour (usually is one period of a day: 7:00–9:00 am) in
Beijing, and a focus on students' school travel mode choice behavior is
of obvious signi<U+FB01>cance where the objective is to create a better travel
environment for students' school commuting in developing countries.

4. Data

The data are collected from the 2014 household travel survey in
Beijing, the capital of China, which is the perfect re<U+FB02>ection of the in-
stitutional and cultural dimensions of China (Li and Zhao, 2015). Due to
the consideration of unique requirements related to economic and
cultural di<U+FB00>erences in China, this study could provide deeper insights
into how school travel mode choice behavior might change with the key
in<U+FB02>uencing factors for students in developing countries, and help the
policy-makers put forward the target-oriented proposals to create a
better school travel environment for local students there.
The primary data source used in this study comes from the Fifth
Travel Survey of Beijing Inhabitants (2014), which is conducted by the
Beijing Municipal Committee of Transport, and provides the most re-
cent travel survey data representative of the whole city by far. The
dataset includes the activity and travel information of 101,815 mem-
bers from 40,003 households obtained in Beijing, China during
September 1st to November 1st of 2014. The total sample of travel
survey is 0.52% of the population in 16 districts of Beijing. The sample
distribution is shown in the following table (Table 2). It can be seen that
the sampling rate of each district is relatively uniform. Since the travel
survey is conducted randomly in each district, thus it can be regarded
that the sample from the travel survey is representative of the whole
population.
Survey respondents were asked to record their activities for 24 h
from 3 am on one day to 3 am the next day. The activity participation
was reported with travel purpose, travel origin and destination, travel
mode, travel time, departure time, etc. The corresponding background
information related household wealth, household structure and per-
sonal attributes were also documented.
Considering that the combination of outbound and inbound trips
may obscure the characteristics of students' school travel mode choice
behavior, this paper focuses on the home to school trips. The return
trips are not included in this study for lack of space. Within the context
of this study, school commuting trips from home to school by
7–18 year-old students were analyzed (i.e., typically 1th–12th Grades

from primary school to high school). After error-checking, cleaning and
clearing the data, there are 4580 school commuting trips can be used
for the case study. The interaction between the household members is
also taken into consideration in this paper. Information about the
household's accompaniment can be found from the primary data
source. School district is an important factor related to built environ-
ment. If the addresses of student's school and residence belong to the
same district, the student can be thought of living within a school
district. To some extent, living within a school district represents a
relatively shorter travel distance to school. Distance to the nearest bus/
subway station is a measurement of public transit accessibility. The
intersection number along the school travel route, which concerns
about the travel safety of students, can re<U+FB02>ect the environment for ac-
tive mode. Four school travel modes including walk, bus/subway, cycle,
and car are explored in this paper due to the signi<U+FB01>cant proportion of
96.40% of all school trips. The other mode includes school bus, mo-
torcycle and so on. It is worth noting that di<U+FB00>erent from the some
Western countries, Chinese citizens are granted the right to driving li-
censes from the age of 18, compared to the legal driving age of 16 in the
US. Therefore, high-school students are allowed to drive to school alone
in the US while the Chinese high-school students are not. In this study,
the alternative school travel modes for all the students are the same.
De<U+FB01>nitions of the selected variables and their descriptive statistics
are displayed in Table 3. In the dataset, the average household annual
income is nearly the range of 50,000–100,000 CNY; 63% of students are
living with the parents who both have jobs; 62% of families have at
least one car, showing that the household wealth is relatively higher as
for the families have students. 87% of students live within a school
district; 56% of students live in the core and extended zones. The
average travel distance between students' home and the nearest bus/
subway station is 0.71 km, which is an acceptable distance for most of
students. And the average intersection number is 5.39. More than half
of the students are boys, the average age of the sample is 12.35 years
old, and the average school level is 1.66, indicating the distribution of
gender and age is relatively uniform. 88% of students have a local
hukou of Beijing, consisting with the educational resources distribution
and admissions policy in Beijing. Moreover, in the dataset, the average
travel distance for students' school commuting is 3.89 km, and 87% of
students leave for school at rush hour. It should be noted that some trips
conducted in rush hour and other time are from the same individual.
Due to the tra<U+FB03>c condition di<U+FB00>erence during rush hour and other time,
the corresponding travel mode choice results may be di<U+FB00>erent. Given
the sample size limitation for trips conducted in other time, we keep
both trips and introduce the binary variable “Departure time” to re<U+FB02>ect
the in<U+FB02>uence of departure time on travel mode choice. 20% of the
students are escorted to school, which is lower than the share in the US

(47% of male children are driven to school and 53% of female children,
Deka, 2013). More attentions will be given in the following sections to
analyze how these factors in<U+FB02>uence students' school travel mode choice.
Table 4 shows the modal distribution in di<U+FB00>erent distances. It il-
lustrates the mode share of walking decreases with the increase of the
travel distance, and that of motorized modes (car and public transit) are
the opposite. The mode share of cycling increases with the increase of
the travel distance <U+FB01>rst and then decreases. Also, it indicates that nearly
half (47.5%) of the students live within 2 km of the school in Beijing,
and their dominating travel mode is walking. For the travel distance of
2–6 km, cycling is the most important travel mode for the students.
When the travel distance is greater than 6 km, public transit is preferred
by the most students. Overall, it can be concluded from the Table 4 that
active modes are used most within the travel distance of 6 km, while
motorized modes dominate for the travel distance greater than 6 km.
The travel characteristics of all the school commuting modes are
shown in Table 5. It re<U+FB02>ects that the average travel distance for Chinese
students in Beijing is signi<U+FB01>cantly lower than that for American stu-
dents in the study of McDonald (2008a). Since over 80% of students live
more than 1.5 km from their schools, American students' average travel
distance is 6.4 km. For the sample population, the modes of walking
and cycling are most suitable for the short-distance school travel, car is
appropriate for the middle-distance school travel, and the mode of
public transit is more suitable for the long-distance school travel.

5. Methodology: integration of a tree-based and a logit-based
regression

In this section, an integration of a tree-based regression model and a
logit-based regression model is employed to investigate students' school
travel mode choice behavior. Speci<U+FB01>cally, the tree-based regression
model graphically describes some preliminary <U+FB01>ndings, which can be
then used to identify the key in<U+FB02>uencing factors and classify the target
variables for the logistic regression model e<U+FB03>ciently. The joint appli-
cation of these two models can provide more comprehensive and ac-
curate results compared to the previous studies. Logistic regression
model has an advantage in parameter estimation and error estimation
since the aggregation within the data group has been taken into con-
sideration. However, its outstanding performance relies on the identi-
<U+FB01>cation and classi<U+FB01>cation of the key in<U+FB02>uencing factors. Decision tree
method can e<U+FB03>ciently classify the target audiences into subgroups
whose members have the homogeneous characteristics in<U+FB02>uencing the
mode choice. The regression results of the decision tree then can be
used to guide the identi<U+FB01>cation of the important independent variables
and the classi<U+FB01>cation of the continuous variables in logistic regression
model. Speci<U+FB01>cally, there are several notable algorithms used to create

cases for parent nodes and child nodes are set with the default values as
100, 50 respectively in the tree-based model, the signi<U+FB01>cance values for
splitting nodes and merging categories are set as 0.05. Since the larger

the tree depth is, the more independent variables will be included, and
more detailed information will be provided, the tree depth is set as 5
levels, which is the largest tree depth for the QUEST algorithm.

As shown in Fig. 2, the <U+FB01>rst optimum split in node 0 is according to

travel distance, which classi<U+FB01>es student travel mode into two sub-
groups. For travel distance = 6 km, the shares of walk, cycle, bus or
subway, and car are 34.9%, 33.7%, 16.1% and 12.5% respectively. For
travel distance > 6 km, the shares of bus or subway, car, cycle and

walk are 49.4%, 28.5%, 14.7% and 0.2% respectively. Obviously, the
active travel modes will turn to motorized modes as the travel distance

increases. Further, the variable of Travel Distance divides the population

into some speci<U+FB01>c intervals, i.e., = 2 km; 2–6 km; > 6 km. Intersection
Number divides the population into <U+FB01>ve subgroups, i.e., = 5; 5–6; 6–7;
7–8; > 8. And School Level distinguishes the population of students in
primary school and that in high school respectively. Since the high

correlation between school level and age, the results of the tree-based
model indicates that the variable of School Level plays more signi<U+FB01>cant

e<U+FB00>ect on school travel mode choice than the variable of Age.
Fig. 2 shows the percentage of walk decreases rapidly with the in-
creasing of travel distance; the percentage of motorized modes in-
creases with the increasing of travel distance; the mode choice of cycle

changes in a nonlinear form. The percentage share of walk is highest

(60.4%) among the students for travel distance = 2 km, and the inter-
section number is = 5. The percentage share of cycle is highest (62.5%)

among the students living in the extended zone for travel distance of
2–6 km, without available household vehicles, and intersection number
is = 5. The percentage share of public transit is highest (85.0%) among
the students without available household vehicles for travel dis-

tance > 6 km, and intersection number is > 8. The percentage share of

car is highest (81.4%) among the students who are dropped o<U+FB00> for
travel distance > 6 km, and intersection number is > 8.
Apparently, the tree-based regression model provides an in-
tuitionistic exhibition of students' school travel mode, and gives im-

plications related to classi<U+FB01>cation of key factors. Given few variables
are taken into consideration within the tree construction, as well as the
direction and the e<U+FB00>ect of key factors are uncertain, it is necessary to
investigate the in<U+FB02>uencing factors based on a logit-based regression

model in the next step.

6.2. Logit-based regression model




The tree-based regression model shows that travel distance with the
threshold of 6 km is the most important classi<U+FB01>cation factor for stu-
dents' school travel mode choice. Thus the students are divided into two
subgroups: students living within 6 km and out of 6 km. The corre-
sponding regression results are described in Tables 6 and 7 according by
the categories mentioned above, respectively, where the referent group
for dependent variable is car. The problem of multicollinearity also has
been tested through the measurement of Variance In<U+FB02>ation Factor
(VIF).

6.2.1. Children's characteristics factors
For students living within 6 km from school, the coe<U+FB03>cients on sex
are highly signi<U+FB01>cant for cycle, public transit and walk. The positive
sign suggests that active modes and public transit are most favored by
boys. For students living longer than 6 km from school, it shows that sex
is uncorrelated with students' school travel choice. This <U+FB01>nding reveals
that there are male-female di<U+FB00>erences in school travel mode only for
the short travel distance in Beijing. Similar and dissimilar <U+FB01>ndings can
be found in previous studies conducted in other countries. For example,
Ermagun et al. (2015a) proposed that the propensity of male students to
choose public transit or walk is greater than that of female students in
Iran. Nelson et al. (2008) found that there are approximately one third

of students actively commute to school in Ireland, and the more male
students commute actively (more travel by bicycle) than females, while
the others (Leslie et al., 2010) in Australia found the opposite. The
reasons behind gender di<U+FB00>erence in mode choice have not been well
illustrated (Ermagun and Samimi, 2015). Under the Chinese context,
this gender di<U+FB00>erence can be attributed to parental concern and limited
travel world of female students.
Regarding the e<U+FB00>ect of local hukou, for students living within 6 km
from school, the coe<U+FB03>cients on local hukou are highly signi<U+FB01>cant for the
choice of public transit and walk. The negative sign suggests that school
trips with local hukou can reduce the propensity of public transit and
walk for the short travel distance. For students living longer than 6 km
from school, local hukou is signi<U+FB01>cant between the public transit and
car. The negative sign shows that students with local hukou are more
willing to be driven to school (compared to public transit) for the long
travel distance. As introduced before, hukou institution is a Chinese
unique population policy used to control the movement of the rural
population into the city (Li and Zhao, 2015), especially in Beijing. It is
related to the distribution of state's welfare, such as education as well as
the purchase quali<U+FB01>cations of house and vehicle. In generally, a student

with a local hukou has the priority to access private car, and therefore
has higher possibility to be driven to school.
As for the school level, for students living within 6 km from school,
school level acts signi<U+FB01>cantly on travel alternatives of public transit and
cycle. For students at primary school, they don't prefer the modes of
public transit and cycle, while the students at middle school dislike
cycling compared with high-school students. For students living longer
than 6 km from school, the coe<U+FB03>cient of primary school is negative for
public transit and cycle, indicating car is most preferred by primary-
school students for the long-distance travel. The negative coe<U+FB03>cient of
middle school for public transit implies that middle-school students are
more willing to use cars compared with public transit. The study con-
ducted by Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2008) stated that children aged
6–12 years in the US are more likely to use the motorized travel modes,
while children aged 13–17 years have the highest utility for biking or
walking independently to school. In Beijing, when the travel distance is
greater than 6 km, the likelihood of travelling by car is relatively higher
among the primary-school students, which is similar to what is found in
the US. And for the short-distance school travel, due to the parental
concern to their young children, public transit or cycle is not allowed
for primary-school students. Moreover, in accordance with some pre-
vious studies (Nevelsteen et al., 2012; Ermagun and Samimi, 2015;
Ermagun and Levinson, 2016a), older children are more likely to travel
autonomously and less willing to be accompanied by either parents or
siblings, to seek a more independent lifestyle. Therefore, compared

with middle school students, high-school students prefer cycling under
the short-distance school travel, and most likely to use public transit for
the long-distance school travel in Beijing.


6.2.2. Households' characteristics factors
Household income is found to be an important factor in<U+FB02>uencing

students' school travel mode choice. For students living within 6 km

from school, low-income families are found to be more likely to choose
public transit mode to school. Moreover, low-income variable also has a
signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on the mode choice of cycle. For students living longer
than 6 km from school, low-income families are fond of public transit
compared with car. Many studies have addressed a positive correlation
between the propensity of driving students to school and household

income (Ermagun et al., 2015a; Ermagun and Levinson, 2016b).

Ermagun and Samimi (2015) reveal that increased household income
reduces the likelihood of public transit use while increases the chance
of driving and walking in Iran. Similar to these countries, students in
Beijing from low-income families are most likely to use the non-car


modes, due to the high relationship between household income and car
ownership. In this study, household income has no e<U+FB00>ect on walking
under short-distance travel, indicating that the mode choice of walking
has no correlation to household income. In Beijing, there is no di<U+FB00>er-
ence between students from high-income households and that from
low-income households when they walk to school. Similar conclusion is

also obtained from the study of Deka (2013) in the US. For the low-


income families, students walk to school because of the travel cost,
while for the high-income families, students walk to school maybe due


to their parents' awareness about their health bene<U+FB01>ts or the better
neighborhood quality.
Car ownership is another major predictor of school travel choice
with highly signi<U+FB01>cant and large coe<U+FB03>cients. For students living within

6 km from school, the students are more likely to be driven to school

when their families have cars, while the students from households with
dual-career parents prefer non-car travel modes. For students living
longer than 6 km from school, the highly signi<U+FB01>cant and negative
coe<U+FB03>cients on car ownership for other travel modes also suggest the


propensity of car for households with cars. Dual-career displays no


signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on the school travel trips. Consistent with foreign

studies (Ermagun et al., 2015a; Ermagun et al., 2015b; Ermagun and
Levinson, 2016a), the students in Beijing from households with cars
have a higher likelihood of being driven to school since they have ac-
cess to private cars. Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2008) have found the
strong impacts of parental employment and work <U+FB02>exibility on chil-
dren's mode choice decisions in the US. Speci<U+FB01>cally, mothers who go to
work on the school day (and do not have full <U+FB02>exibility in their work
schedules) are more willing to drive their children to school, while the
fathers who have full <U+FB02>exibility in their work schedules are more likely
to drive their children to school. Contradictory results are found in this
study, dual-career parents choose non-car travel modes for their chil-
dren in Beijing, maybe because of their great greater time constraints.

6.2.3. Built environment factors
Regarding the e<U+FB00>ect of school district, for students living within
6 km from school, households living within school district show their
preference to public transit, cycle and walk, this means shorter travel
distance is helpful for encourage students' active and independent
mobility. For students living longer than 6 km from school, school
district displays a signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on all the travel modes except for
walk (the sample size of walk is small when the school travel distance is
more than 6 km). The results show living within the school district
increases the propensity of these modes. In conclusion, the likelihood of
being driven to school is relatively lower for students living within the
school district in Beijing. Since the variable School District represents a
relatively shorter travel distance to school to some extent, we will
discuss the e<U+FB00>ect of distance on students' mode choice afterwards.
With respect to geographic distribution, for students living within

106

R. Zhang et al.


6 km from school, the signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects on all travel modes con<U+FB01>rm
that students living within core and development zones are more
willing to walk, following by are public transit and cycle, while students
living within extended zone are most likely to use public transit fol-
lowed by walk. Speci<U+FB01>cally, the positive coe<U+FB03>cients for core zone are
the largest. This implies that di<U+FB00>erent functional zones have their own
school travel pattern, and the students living within core zone have the
maximum probability to choose active modes and public transit. The
coe<U+FB03>cient on public transportation accessibility only works on the
mode of public transit, and the result indicates that the likelihood of
using public transit is particularly large when the travel distance be-
tween students' home and the nearest bus/subway station is within
1 km for the short-distance school travel. For students living longer
than 6 km from school, no signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erence among di<U+FB00>erent school
travel modes has been found in term of living location and public
transportation accessibility, indicating these two factors are not the
determinants in regards to students' school travel mode choice for
students living far from school. The study conducted by Merom et al.
(2006) in Australia has discussed the e<U+FB00>ect of geographic distribution
on students' school travel mode choice. It found that students in rural
areas are most dependent on bus travel while students in urban com-
munities use cars more frequently. Another study conducted by Deka
(2013) in the US found that students in large metropolitan areas are
most likely to walk or cycle to school compared to rural, non-me-
tropolitan, and small metropolitan areas. In Beijing, core zone is re-
garded as the inner city of Beijing, thus the neighbor quality and travel
environment are better for students' independent mobility. The ex-
tended zone is the representative area of high technology industries and
educational institutions, therefore the population density is also at a
high level. Similar to the results of Ermagun and Levinson (2016b), the
use of walking and public transit increases in school trips with the in-
crease of population density. For development zone, bicycle is also used
most among the students, mainly because of the imperfect public transit
system. In addition, a negative relationship between the public transit
usage and distance to the nearest public transit station is widely re-
cognized although the e<U+FB00>ect magnitudes are di<U+FB00>erent. Ermagun et al.
(2015b) described that the tendency to use public transit will increase
for school travel when the home-public transit station distance is less
than 600 m. While Alemu and Tsutsumi (2011) thought 1.5 km distance
to public transit station is available to take the public transit. These
<U+FB01>ndings are all similar to what is found in Beijing with regard to the
e<U+FB00>ect of public transportation accessibility.
As for intersection number, for students living within 6 km from
school, intersection number has signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects on the choice of walk
and cycle. It indicates that less intersection number encourages children
to walk or cycle to school. For students living longer than 6 km from
school, it is found that intersection number has signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects on the
choice of cycle when intersection number is =2, and works on the
choice of public transit when intersection number of 2–8, indicating
that less intersection number increases the propensity of using cycle
while decreases the propensity of using public transit for the long-dis-
tance school travel. Some researchers have reported the positive re-
lationship between walking to school and intersection density
(Schlossberg et al., 2006). And some have found that the choice of
walking is uncorrelated with the street intersections density (Mitra
et al., 2010). Contradictory results are found in the study of Lin and
Chang (2010) that increased intersection numbers discourage children
from walking to school independently in Taiwan. Similar to the later
study, the reduced intersection number correlates with increase in the
use of active modes in Beijing. For long-distance school travel, the in-
creased intersection number reduces the propensity of using the public
transit for students due to the travel comfort.

6.2.4. Travel characteristics factors
The coe<U+FB03>cients on departure time are highly signi<U+FB01>cant across all
travel modes for students living both within 6 km and greater than 6 km


Journal of Transport Geography 62 (2017) 98–110


from school. And the negative signs suggest that leaving for school at
rush hour reduces the propensities of using these alternative modes.
That is, students in Beijing are most likely to be driven to school when
they are leaving for school at rush hour. In Beijing, the tra<U+FB03>c volume
will signi<U+FB01>cantly increase during the rush hour. Considering their
children's travel safety, parents will be more willing to escort their
children to school. Moreover, it is convenient for parents to drive their
children to school in the morning on their way to work since the start
times of schools for students are usually before or approximate the same
time that parents depart for work in Beijing. Similar <U+FB01>ndings can also be
found in the study of Lin and Chang (2010), although which is con-
ducted in Taiwan, China.
With regard to the e<U+FB00>ect of accompaniment, for students living
within 6 km from school, car is most likely to be used for school trips
with adults' accompaniment. For students living longer than 6 km from
school, the coe<U+FB03>cients on accompaniment are highly signi<U+FB01>cant for the
choice of public transit. The negative sign suggests that school trips
with adults' accompaniment can reduce the likelihood of using public
transit. Therefore, in Beijing, when students are escorted by their fa-
milies, the likelihood of being driven to school is relatively higher. The
<U+FB01>nding from Ermagun et al. (2015b) also shows that younger students
had more probability to choose escorted modes of transportation, in-
cluding school buses and private cars. However, school bus service isn't
common in China since it is neither state provided nor free like in many
Western countries (Ermagun and Levinson, 2016a), thus it is reasonable
for most parents in Beijing to drive their children to school.
Consistent with many studies worldwide (Yarlagadda and
Srinivasan, 2008; Deka, 2013; Kelly and Fu, 2014), the likelihood of
using non-motorized modes decreases with the increased distance to
school. In this study, distance is also found as a signi<U+FB01>cant reason for a
decline in shares of active school transport and an increase in shares of
motorized modes. For students living within 6 km from school, in-
creased travel distance reduces the active modes utilization. For stu-
dents living longer than 6 km from school, compared to school travel
longer than 10 km, the school trips made within 6–10 km are more
likely to use bicycle. Thus increased travel distance can reduces the
utility of using the bicycle.

7. Discussions

In Western countries, many e<U+FB00>orts have been devoted into the
policy research and investment evaluation related to the improvement
of active and independent mobility for students. For example in the US,
the Safe Routes to School (SRTS) programs have been implemented
since 2005, and the major focus of these programs is the investments
toward infrastructure improvement (NCSRS, 2010). In Canada, school
travel plans (STPs) have been proposed to help the families choose
green travel modes. In addition to the engineering projects, these
strategies emphasize the education and encouragement on sustainable
travel, and the law enforcement about parking and driving near schools
(ARTA, 2007). Although there are some di<U+FB00>erences on fundamental
realities between the Western countries and China, their practices still
suggest a systematic research that would improve our current under-
standing of students' school travel mode choice and further inform
development of future interventions to create a better travel environ-
ment for students in Beijing, China.
The results from this study reveal that the planning and layout of
infrastructures, as well as the travel demand management policies may
play potentially important roles in enabling the active and independent
mobility among the students. The speci<U+FB01>c lessons from this are dis-
cussed in the following subsections.

7.1. Planning and layout of infrastructures

First, di<U+FB00>erent from the Western countries, the urban form in Beijing
is divided into four di<U+FB00>erent functional zones. The modelling results

107

R. Zhang et al.


indicate the use of active modes and public transit increases in school
trips with the increase of population density in Beijing. Therefore, in
addition to continuing improving the travel environment for active
modes in high-population density zones, attention on transport and
education should also be paid to the low-population density zones, like
ecological conservation zone in Beijing. Since the likelihood of being
driven to school decreases for students living within the school district
in Beijing, it is necessary to arrange the schools scienti<U+FB01>cally according
to the land use, population structure and distribution. Meanwhile, the
educational resources of high quality should be distributed evenly to
lead the students choose the school near their home.
Second, the <U+FB01>ndings from this study reveal that each alternative
travel mode has its own competitive scope, which is also unlike the
Western countries. For example, the criterion distance for Irish students
to walk and cycle to school is less than 2.4 km and less than 4.0 km,
respectively. For the distance of 4.0–4.8 km, government needs to
subsidize transport to school for post-primary pupils in Ireland. In
Denmark, it is required that secondary school students must live a
distance greater than 8 km from school to avail of free transport (Nelson
et al., 2008). In Canada, it is regarded that a distance more than 5 km
will restrict the school travel mode to motorized transport only (Mitra
et al., 2010). In China, 3 km is deemed as the cut-o<U+FB00> value between
active modes and motorized modes in 2005 (Li and Zhao, 2015).
Compared with students in Western countries, Chinese students walk
shorter but cycle farther. And compared with Chinese students in
Beijing a decade ago, students now both walk and cycle farther, in-
dicating the school commuting distance continues to grow in recent
years.
In comparison, the corresponding service supporting facilities
should be designed appropriately to maximize the function of each
travel mode in Beijing according to the descriptive and modelling re-
sults from this study. As shown in Table 4, the majority of the students
choose to walk for the distances of 0–2 km. Therefore, the urban
planners should concentrate on the construction of pedestrian-friendly
environment to enhance the walkability, and the connection with the
public transportation. Regarding the safety issue on the young students,
it is advisable to introduce the travel mode of walking school bus
(WSB), which is widely practiced in England, New Zealand, and US. The
WSB programs, i.e., a group of children picked up throughout the
neighborhood walk to/from school with the accompaniment of parents
or other adults, have been proved to be a potential option to improve
children's pedestrian safety (Mendoza et al., 2012). The statistical re-
sults also show that the optimal scope for cycling is the distance of
2–6 km. Thus, the construction of a cycling-friendly road networks
should be focused on. In Beijing, the characteristics of urban mixed
tra<U+FB03>c make the motorized vehicle and non-motorized vehicle interfere
each other seriously. As a result, e<U+FB00>orts should be devoted to the se-
parate bicycle lanes, bicycle parking/storage facilities, and so on. Given
the e<U+FB03>ciencies of travel modes, it is reasonable for the students using
public transit when the travel distance is above 6 km. Within the op-
timal service radius near the school for public transit, the bus or subway
stations should be set reasonably to ensure a high accessibility for the
public transit. As the modelling results suggest in this study, the like-
lihood of using public transit is particularly large when the travel dis-
tance between students' home and the nearest bus/subway station is
within 1 km.
Third, similar to the foreign countries, students in Beijing from
households with cars are more willing to be driven to school. For the
families which are accustomed to drive their children to school, it isn't
easy to force them change their habits in the short term. Therefore, it is
important for the urban planners to reserve the parking facilities within
some distance of the school according to the school scale, students'
structure and land use.

7.2. Implementing of related policies

It has been reported in recent studies that the integration of infra-
structure construction and policy formulation has an excellent impact
on active school travel rates (Mitra and Buliung, 2015). Based on the
<U+FB01>ndings from this study, three travel demand management policies are
proposed according to the institutional and cultural context in Beijing.
First, the modelling results in this study reveal that students in
Beijing are most likely to be driven to school when they are leaving for
school at rush hour. The reason behind this phenomenon may lie in two
aspects. On the one hand, given large travel demand at peak hours
deteriorates the travel environment and increases the risk of accidents,
many parents drive their children to school to ensure a comfortable and
safe school trip. On the other hand, it is convenient for the parents to
drive their children to school on their way to work within the time
constraint. Therefore, it is crucial to implement di<U+FB00>erent working hour
in Beijing to reduce the travel demand at rush hour, and further in-
crease parents' perception about their children's travel safety to school,
as well as cause the inconvenience of driving students to school.
Second, it should be noted that this study cannot analyze students'
school travel mode choice behavior escorted by friends or relatives due
to the unavailability of the related data. The modelling results in this
study explore that when students are escorted to school, the likelihood
of using cars is relatively higher in Beijing. Therefore, it is important to
shed light on the education about the sustainable travel modes and
cultivate an awareness of independent mobility for both students and
their parents. As for the students requiring the accompaniment of adults
due to some speci<U+FB01>c reasons, it is advised to walk or use bicycle to
escort the students for the short distance, while for the longer distance,
it is advocated to use school bus or public transit. Although car is more
convenient, the awareness of sustainable travel should root in every
citizen's mind with the improvement of public transit network and
school bus service. The <U+FB01>nding of Ermagun et al. (2015b) shows that
younger students in Tehran are more willing to choose escorted travel
modes, including school buses and private cars. It should be noted that
there are some school strips using school bus in the sample data (2.6%
of the sample population), the average travel distance of school bus
(7.04 km) is the same as the public transit's, and the school bus can
reduce the average travel time up to 42.54% compared with public
transit (the average travel time of school bus is 28.67 min). However,
school bus service isn't common in China since it is neither state pro-
vided nor free like in many Western countries (Ermagun and Levinson,
2016a), thus it is urgent for the government to take measures to pro-
mote the development of school bus service in Beijing, and the focus
should be concentrated on the problems such as school bus route
planning and the school bus stop station layout.
Third, the modelling results in this study indicate that school trips
with local hukou of Beijing reduce the propensity of public transit and
active modes, while increase the likelihood of being driven to school.
Di<U+FB00>erent from the Western countries, hukou institution is a unique
Chinese policy in Beijing to control the rural population and the related
welfare distribution. It is also one of the premises of vehicle purchase in
Beijing. Similar to the students from households with cars, students
with local hukou also have the priority to access private car, and then
have higher possibility to be driven to school. Thus, it is necessary to
keep on implementing the quota control policy for car ownership, and
further promote and encourage students' active and independent mo-
bility. In addition to the existing quota control for Beijing hukou which
can impose restrictions on the car ownership in total to some extent,
e<U+FB00>orts can be made from the following aspects in light of the successful
experience of foreign countries. 1) Increase the vehicle purchase cost,
such like the car ownership system in Singapore. It is managed via both
the requirement to bid for a Certi<U+FB01>cate of Entitlement (COE) and the
payment of an Additional Registration Fee (ARF), which typically ac-
count for more than half the purchase cost of a vehicle. The COE entitles
the usage of local roads and the ARF is refundable to incentivize the

108

R. Zhang et al.


vehicle deregistration (Chu, 2015). 2) Raise the standards for vehicle

purchase, such like the vehicle registration law in Japan. Its vehicle
registration is conditional upon demonstrating access to a long-standing
parking space near the residence. And the practice proves that this

policy can e<U+FB00>ectively slow the growth of car ownership, especially in
the places with high property prices (Barter, 2011).


8. Conclusions

This study is an e<U+FB00>ort to develop a framework incorporating tree-

based regression method and logit-based regression method to explain

the behavioral aspects of students' school travel mode choice.
Understanding the motives behind such behaviors is signi<U+FB01>cant for
urban planners to create a better travel environment for students' active

and independent mobility, which is widely recognized as an opportu-
nity to solve the health issues related to individuals, cost issues related
to households, negative externalities issues related to the transportation

system.
Speci<U+FB01>cally, the tree-based regression model is introduced to o<U+FB00>er a
clear interpretation of the results through identifying the key factors

and indicating the split thresholds of the variables. The logit-based
regression model is used to enrich and broaden the preliminary <U+FB01>ndings
based on the results of decision tree. Both of the two methods provide

di<U+FB00>erent insights into the behavioral representations of the underlying

decision processes. In this study, some signi<U+FB01>cant factors that in<U+FB02>uence
school travel mode choice were examined. Especially, the results show

that car ownership, poor walking/cycling environment and adults'

convenience for escorting students signi<U+FB01>cantly stimulate the use of
cars in school commuting. The students are more inclined to be driven
to school when their departure time is at rush hour compared to the

other time. Moreover, the longer distance encourages the use of mo-
torized transport, where the households with local hukou (usually re-
lated to the car ownership and other welfares) are more willing to drive

their children to school. Further, it is found that living within school
district can reduce the probability of using the car.
According to the <U+FB01>ndings from this study, recommendations for

policymakers and advocates on school travel environment planning and
management are proposed to improve the transportation services for
students in Beijing from primary to high schools. The strategies about

layout of educational resources, development of alternative school
travel options within the optimal distance scope, planning of parking
facilities near school are introduced speci<U+FB01>cally. In addition, the lit-

erature suggests that travel demand management-related policies on

implementing di<U+FB00>erent working hour, education and propaganda about
the sustainable travel modes, as well as the quota control for car
ownership are also should be paid attention to. These <U+FB01>ndings improve

current knowledge on the correlation of school travel choice and pro-
vide local evidence that may inform school transportation planning
practice in Beijing, China. The study also advances school travel be-
