Evidence in support of cycle training is limited, and its potential to improve safety and make a tangible difference to
cycling levels is unclear. Nevertheless, Bikeability, the UK government’s cycle training programme introduced in 2006,
is widespread in schools and is actively supported by many parents/carers. This paper draws together a number of
evidence sources in an attempt to understand the role of cycle training as one among several measures for increasing
active travel. It reviews existing research regarding the role of and outcomes from cycle training for children before
offering an overview of the current distribution of cycle training in English schools. Next it draws on two new data
sources – the 2014 CensusAtSchool and the 2014 Bikeability School Travel Survey – to explore outcomes, experiences
and perceptions of cycling and cycle training from a child’s perspective. From this it draws conclusions regarding the role
of cycle training in schools and elaborates on what this means for policy makers and practitioners.
