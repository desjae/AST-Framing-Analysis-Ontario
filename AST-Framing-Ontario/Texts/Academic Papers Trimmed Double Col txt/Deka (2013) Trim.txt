Fig. 1. Modes used by children to go to school by work-trip modes of household
adults. Source: Prepared from pooled data for households with school-going
children aged 5–15 in the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (USDOT, 2011).



Although the concept is easily understood, the reasons that drive
individuals to select a lifestyle cannot be easily discerned,
let alone quanti<U+FB01>ed.
A classic example of a lifestyle choice is an individual’s decision
to be a homemaker. When a person decides to be a homemaker,
while others with similar characteristics decide to participate in
the wage-labor market, the reasons for that person’s decision not
to participate in the labor force cannot be observed in labor-market
data. It is in this context that the Heckman model was born
(Heckman, 1974, 1976, 1979). The premise of the Heckman model
is that, because of the unobservable reasons prompting some
individuals not to participate in the labor force, the observed
labor market outcomes are biased due to self-selection. In addition
to allowing for the correction of this bias, the Heckman model
enables one to determine the effect of the selection bias on an
outcome measure.
This paper uses the Heckman model to examine the interrela-
tionship between workers’ travel mode to work and children’s
mode to school. While a logit or probit model can be used to pre-
dict the travel mode of a child by taking adults’ mode as an exog-
enous independent variable, or vice versa, the Heckman model
involves joint prediction of the travel modes of the two groups
through a system of two equations. By doing so, the model ac-
counts for the effect of self-selection by the <U+FB01>rst group on the mode
choice of the second group. Thus, compared to logit or probit mod-
els, the Heckman model has the advantage of adding an element of
causality in the prediction of travel modes.
From the lifestyle choice perspective, it makes more intuitive
sense to hypothesize that adults’ decisions about travel mode to
work are more fundamental in the household decision process
than children’s travel mode to school. To test this hypothesis,
Heckman probit models were <U+FB01>rst used to examine the effects of
adults using different travel modes to work on children’s travel
mode to school. To examine if the factors that in<U+FB02>uence children’s
mode to school also in<U+FB02>uence adults’ travel mode to work, addi-
tional modeling efforts were undertaken. While children and
adults from the same household may have similarities in their
mode-use patterns because of the similarities in characteristics of
households and the places where they live, when these character-
istics are controlled for, the Heckman model can demonstrate if
there is an additional effect of self-selection by one group on the
modes used by the other group.
To demonstrate that the travel modes of adults and children
may be interrelated, the cross classi<U+FB01>cation of children’s mode to
school is shown against household adults’ travel mode to work in

Fig. 1 by using pooled data from the 2009 US National Household
Travel Survey, or NHTS (USDOT, 2011). Since in many households
one adult walks to work or takes public transit while another adult
drives to work, it is possible for a non-driving adult worker to have
children in the household who are driven to school. It is for this
reason that for each type of commuting mode of adults (see
Fig. 1), a proportion of children are driven to school. However, de-
spite the dilution of the data because of pooling, Fig. 1 still shows
that the proportion of household children being driven to school is
substantially higher for adults who drive to work (57%) compared
to adults who walk or bicycle to work (39%) or take public transit
(34%). Furthermore, the <U+FB01>gure shows that the proportion of house-
hold children who walk or bicycle to school is only 7% for adults
who commute to work by automobile, whereas the proportion is
25% for adults who walk or bicycle to work, and 24% for adults
who use public transit.
Data from the 2009 NHTS were used for the statistical models in
this paper because they provide by far the largest and most recent


travel survey data representative of the country. In contrast to past
surveys, the 2009 edition provides special data on children’s travel
to school and parents’ concerns about children’s travel to school.
For modeling purposes, data from the NHTS person <U+FB01>le and trip <U+FB01>le
were combined. Household adults were pooled for school-going
children aged 5–15. Therefore, the analysis includes only those
households that had school-going children aged 5–15. All working
adults in those households were included in the analysis to ensure
that, in addition to parents, potential caregivers were also taken
into consideration.
The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections. Sec-
tion 2 provides a review of past studies on children’s travel to
school and adults’ travel to work by focusing on the types of mod-
els used for predicting travel modes and variables included in the
models. Section 3 conceptually describes the Heckman model
and provides examples of empirical studies in other <U+FB01>elds by focus-
ing on the use of the model to predict discrete outcomes. Section 4
describes the data used for analysis and presents the results from
the statistical models. Before presenting results from the Heckman
model, results are presented from multinomial logit (MNL) and
probit models on children’s mode choice so that these results can
be compared with the Heckman model results. Although Heckman
models were used to examine the effects of several modes used by
adults on children’s mode and, conversely, to test the effect of
modes used by children on adults’ mode, due to space limitations
detailed results are presented only from the models that examine
children’s mode-use patterns when adults drive to work. However,
summary statistics are presented for different mode combinations
for comparison. Section 5 presents a summary of the <U+FB01>ndings and
implications for future research.


2. Studies on mode choice of adults and children

Mode-choice studies of adults and children typically use statis-
tical models often broadly referred to as discrete choice models,
where the likelihood of using a travel mode is predicted by treating
modes as a binary variable (e.g., car versus other modes) or a cat-
egorical variable (e.g., car versus rail versus bus). These types of
models, elaborately described in Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985)
and Train (1986), are based on the utility theory.
Over the past four decades, a large number of empirical mode-
choice studies have been conducted pertaining to adults’ travel,
mostly in the context of work trips but sometimes also in the
context of non-work trips. Many of these used binary logit models
to compare between two modes (Cervero, 1996; Cervero and
Kockelman, 1997; Cervero and Radisch, 1996), whereas others
used MNL models to compare among several modes (Train, 1980;

56                                              D. Deka / Journal of T


Asensio, 2002; Cervero, 2002; Bhat and Sardesai, 2006; Hensher
and Rose, 2007; Pinjari et al., 2007). In other mode-choice studies
for adults, nested logit models have been used to examine choices
within another set of choices (O’Fallon et al., 2004; Zhang, 2004;
Hensher and Rose, 2007).
To predict the mode choice of adults, researchers historically
have considered a variety of independent variables, including tra-
vel distance, time, and/or monetary cost (Train, 1980; Cervero,
1996, 2002; Hensher and Rose, 2007), characteristics of speci<U+FB01>c
modes (Train, 1980; Cervero, 2002; Schwanen and Mokhtarian,
2005; Hensher and Rose, 2007; Pinjari et al., 2007), household
characteristics such as income, number of workers in the house-
hold, presence of children in the household, and vehicle ownership
(Train, 1980; Cervero, 1996; Srinivasan and Ferreira, 2002; Schwa-
nen and Mokhtarian, 2005), personal characteristics such as gender
and occupation (Schwanen and Mokhtarian, 2005; Hensher and
Rose, 2007), individuals’ perception of travel (Schwanen and
Mokhtarian, 2005), and place characteristics (Cervero, 1996,
2002; Pinjari et al., 2007). While the mode choice of adults has
been studied thoroughly over several decades, children’s mode-
use patterns attracted the attention of researchers primarily during
the previous decade. Since the primary focus of the models in a
majority of these studies is to compare walking or bicycling with
all other modes, these studies have predominantly used binary lo-
git models for prediction purposes. Examples of such studies in-
clude McDonald (2007a, 2007b, 2008a), McMillan et al. (2006),
Timperio et al. (2006), McMillan (2007), Rodríguez and Vogt
(2009), Zhu and Lee (2009), and McDonald et al. (2011). Studies
that compared the likelihood of children using several modes have
generally used MNL models. Examples include McDonald (2008b),
Müller et al. (2008), Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2008), Marshall
et al. (2010), and Wilson et al. (2010). In some instances, research-
ers have used other models, including nested logit (Jensen, 2008),

MNL probit (Sidharthan et al., 2011), and covariance heterogeneity
(Ulfarsson and Shankar, 2008).
The number and characteristics of the independent variables
used for modeling children’s mode to school varies from study to
study. Yet these variables pertain to a few broad categories: spatial
or locational characteristics of places, distance to school, demo-
graphic and socio-economic characteristics of children and house-
holds, school characteristics, and perceptions of adults about

children’s travel. In a review of studies on school travel, Stewart
(2011) noted a large number of studies worldwide that showed
children’s likelihood of using non-motorized modes decreasing

with greater distance to school. In addition to distance, empirical

studies on children’s travel mode to school have included the age
of child, gender, race or ethnicity, household income, household
vehicle ownership, the number of children in a household, parents’
work schedule, and parents’ education (McDonald, 2007a, 2007b,
2008a, 2008c; McMillan, 2007; McDonald et al., 2011). Other areas
addressed include parents’ concerns about children’s travel to
school, dwelling type of parents, single-parent status and home-
maker status of parents, immigrant status of parents, characteris-
tics of areas, and school type (Kerr et al., 2006; McDonald, 2007a,
2007b, 2008a, 2008b; McMillan, 2007; Marshall et al., 2010;
Wilson et al., 2010; McDonald et al., 2011).
Although many studies on children’s school trips do not address
the connection between activities by adult household members
and children, a few studies have explicitly considered this relation-
ship. For example, McDonald’s (2008b) binary logit model on chil-
dren’s travel mode included mother’s and father’s work trip time as
independent variables, Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2008) consid-
ered the in<U+FB02>uence of parents’ employment and work <U+FB02>exibility
on children’s mode use, Copperman and Bhat (2007) studied travel
activity sharing between children and household adults, whereas
Vovsha and Petersen (2005), Schlossberg et al. (2006), Wen et al.
ransport Geography 31 (2013) 54–63


(2008), and Yoon et al. (2011) studied parents’ escorting of school
children. All these studies recognize that travel and non-travel
activities of children and adults in households are often interre-
lated. Many other studies, especially studies on activity based tra-
vel, recognize this interrelationship (Gliebe and Koppelman,
2002;Yagi and Mohammadian, 2008; Timmermans and Zhang,
2009; Maat and Timmermans, 2009). Yet other studies have recog-
nized that the presence of children affects household adults’ travel
patterns (Cervero and Kockelman, 1997; Dieleman et al., 2002;
Srinivasan and Ferreira, 2002; O’Fallon et al., 2004; Schwanen
and Mokhtarian, 2005; Giuliano and Dargay, 2006).
Despite the recognition among many researchers that travel
decisions of household members are interrelated, children’s
mode-choice studies by far have refrained from using models that
jointly predict the travel modes used by adults and children in a
household. One reason for the scarcity of studies that use this ap-
proach may be that, until a few years ago, popular software pro-
grams did not include an option to predict discrete variables
jointly. However, advances in popular statistical programs such
as SAS and STATA have made it easier to make joint predictions
of discrete dependent variables such as travel modes.

3. The Heckman model and its application in empirical studies

The Heckman selection model includes two equations: selection
and outcome. Using notations in Greene (2012), the selection equa-
tion and the outcome equation can be described as follows:

Selection equation : zi ¼ wi c þ ui ; zi ¼ 1 if zi > 0 and 0 otherwise
Probðzi ¼ 1jwi Þ ¼ Uðw0i cÞ and
Probðzi ¼ 0jwi Þ ¼ 1  Uðw0i cÞ


Outcome equation : yi ¼ xi b þ i if zi > 0

where wi is a vector of independent variables determining selection
into a sample, xi is a vector of independent variables determining an
outcome, and zi > 0 indicating that some observations of yi are
missing or censored because of selection. The error terms of the
two equations, ui and i , are normally distributed and the correla-
tion between the two is q. Mathematically,

ui  Nð0; 1Þ



i  Nð0; r2 Þ

corr: ðui ; i Þ ¼ q

The selection and the outcome components of the Heckman
model can include identical independent variables, but the selec-
tion component must include at least one variable that is not in-
cluded in the outcome component. An example of the Heckman
model is the estimation of wages by the outcome equation, where
yi is observed only for those who elect to be in the labor force, but
not for those who choose to be out of the labor force. This problem
is often referred to as a selection bias, sample-selection bias, or
self-selection bias. When the bias exists, the estimation of the
b coef<U+FB01>cients of the outcome equation by the ordinary least
squares method would be inef<U+FB01>cient and the standard errors
would be downward biased (Heckman, 1979). Whether and how
self-selection affects the outcome equation is given by q, the corre-
lation coef<U+FB01>cient of the residuals in the selection and the outcome
equations. In the Heckman model, which corrects for selection bias,
a statistically signi<U+FB01>cant q indicates that selection bias affects the
estimates of b coef<U+FB01>cients and their standard errors in the outcome
equation. A positive sign for q indicates that selection affects the
outcome positively and a negative sign indicates that selection
affects the outcome negatively. For example, when persons in the

D. Deka / Journal of Tr


labor force are coded 1 and persons not in the labor force are coded
0 in the selection equation of a model on wages, a signi<U+FB01>cant and
positive q would indicate that self-selection into the labor force
has a signi<U+FB01>cant positive effect on estimated wages.
During the past decades, many studies in various disciplines
have used the Heckman model with a continuous outcome variable
(yi). Transportation studies that used this method to estimate a
continuous outcome, such as travel distance and time, include
Cooke and Ross (1999), Deka (2002), and Vance and Iovanna
(2007). While many studies used the Heckman model to deal with
missing data due to sample selection, other studies have used it to
compare between groups on the basis of the signi<U+FB01>cance of q; that
is, to examine how the selection into one group affects the depen-
dent variable of the outcome equation. For example, Briggs (2004)
used the method to compare SAT scores of coached and un-coa-
ched students, Maury (2006) used it to compare pro<U+FB01>ts of two dif-
ferent types of <U+FB01>rms, Vance and Iovanna (2007) compared trip
distance for car users and car non-users, and Leslie and Ghomrawi
(2008) compared the effects of two different types of drugs on
treatment duration.
In more recent years, a number of studies in diverse disciplines
have used the Heckman model to examine the effect of selection
on a dichotomous outcome variable. For example, Bratti et al.
(2004) examined whether the employment outcome of students
was related to participation in a survey, Bärnighausen et al.
(2011) examined the likelihood of HIV status reporting on the basis
of type of interview, Drope and Hansen (2009) examined if partic-
ipation in industry associations had an effect on the likelihood of
lobbying, Finney and Yoon (2011) examined the relationship be-
tween municipalities’ decision to develop a web site to conduct
<U+FB01>nancial transactions through the internet, and Heise (2010)
examined if the participation in alternative dispute resolution pro-
grams had an effect on the likelihood of an appeal settling prior to
a judicial decision. Other authors have used the method to study
consumers’ willingness to pay (Petrolia et al., 2010), the effects
of regional trade agreements (Vicard, 2012), social capital
(Cornwell and Cornwell, 2008), oncological evaluation (Davidoff
et al., 2009), anti-depressant treatment (Tiwari et al., 2008), and
attitudes toward general practitioners (Clerc et al., 2011). Despite
these and many other studies in diverse <U+FB01>elds, the use of the
Heckman model to predict dichotomous outcome variables has
been rare in transportation.


4. Data and analysis

4.1. Data

All empirical analysis in this paper is conducted with data from
the 2009 US National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) (USDOT,
2011). This is by far the largest travel survey in the country, provid-
ing household, personal, and travel characteristics for 308,901
individuals belonging to 150,147 households nationwide. The
dataset contains information on 1,167,321 trips made by persons
of all ages for various purposes, including school trips by children
and work trips by adults. In addition to the sheer size of the dataset
and its national representation, the 2009 NHTS has the added ben-
e<U+FB01>t of including a number of questions on children’s school trips
and parents’ perceptions about children’s travel to school.
The data used for the analysis were mostly retrieved from the
NHTS person <U+FB01>le, but complemented by data from the trip <U+FB01>le.
The dataset was restricted to those households that had at least
one school-going child aged 5–15 and whose travel mode to school
was reported. This age group was speci<U+FB01>cally selected to conform
to the NHTS age range pertinent to the federal Safe Routes to
School (SRTS) program. For each of the selected children, the
ansport Geography 31 (2013) 54–63                                         57


household adult workers were pooled. To exclude adults who
might be college students but also make occasional work trips, per-
sons aged 18–24 were eliminated and restricted to ages 25–64.
Since non-parent household adults can also drop off children at
school, all working adults in a household were included in the
dataset. Finally, adult workers who mentioned using a personal
vehicle to travel to work, but who were identi<U+FB01>ed as a vehicle pas-
senger in their commute trip in the trip <U+FB01>le, were considered to
have used other modes instead of being a driver when distributing
workers by trip mode for commuting. It was assumed that these
adults would have little or no in<U+FB02>uence in dropping off children
at school.
In the pooled dataset used for modeling purposes, 47% of male
children are driven to school compared to 53% of female children,
37% of male children take the school bus compared to 36% of fe-
male children, 13% of male children walk or bicycle to school com-
pared to 9% of female children, and 3% of male children use some
other mode compared to 2% of female children. Among the adult
workers in their household, 91% of men drive to work compared
to 92% of females, 4% of men use public transit compared to 5%
of females, 3% of men walk or bicycle to work compared to 2% of
females, and 2% of men use some other mode compared to 1%
of females.

4.2. Selection of variables and their expected in<U+FB02>uence on travel mode

As indicated in the literature review, a wide range of variables
pertaining to children, parents, households, schools, neighbor-
hoods, and perceptions have been used by researchers to predict
the travel mode of children. Similarly, a range of variables pertain-
ing to transportation systems, individuals, households, and places
have been used as exogenous variables to predict the travel modes
of adults for work and non-work trips. The independent variables
for the models on children’s and workers’ mode choice in this pa-
per were selected on the basis of past empirical studies.
Distance to school is a critical variable for the model on chil-
dren’s trips to school, and is expected to decrease the likelihood
of using non-motorized modes. Based on prior studies, younger
children are more likely to be driven to school than older children
and they are expected to walk less. Empirical studies also show
that female children are less likely to walk or bicycle than male
children. A variable on schools’ restriction on walking alone has
been included with the expectation that such policies would deter
walking and bicycling among children. School type has been in-
cluded with the expectation that public school students are less
likely to be dropped off by household vehicles and they would be
more likely to walk and bicycle than private school students be-
cause private schools, which are fewer in number, are likely to
be more geographically dispersed than public schools.
A dummy variable on single parents was included with the
expectation that children from single-parent households would
be more likely to be dropped off at school, because working single
parents are expected to have greater time constraints and concerns
about children’s safety. The number of children aged 5–15 was in-
cluded as a variable with the expectation that having one or more
school-age siblings would increase the likelihood of walking to
school. A set of three variables on parents’ safety concerns about
children’s travel to school were included, with the expectation that
a greater concern would decrease the likelihood of walking and
bicycling and increase the likelihood of using motorized modes.
Although the NHTS provides a variable on parents’ concern about
distance to school, it was not included because actual distance
has already been considered. A series of dummy variables repre-
senting household income has been included, with the expectation
that children from higher income households would be more likely
to be driven to school and less likely to take a school bus or walk.

Variables on dwelling type and dwelling tenure have been included
to represent suburban living, with the expectation that children
living in detached and owned homes would be less likely to walk
or bicycle and more likely to use motorized modes. Race, ethnicity,
and the foreign-born status of parents have been included, with
the expectation that minority children would be less likely to be
driven to school and more likely to use alternative modes. A set
of dummy variables on metropolitan population size has been in-
cluded, with the expectation that, due to a relatively urban envi-
ronment in large metropolitan areas, children would walk more
and use motorized modes less. Finally, a variable on household
adults’ travel mode to work has been included as an exogenous
variable in the MNL and the probit models, with the expectation
that children from households with workers driving to work would
be more likely to be driven to school.
The selection of exogenous variables for the mode-choice mod-
els for workers’ commute followed a similar logic as the children’s
mode-choice models. Like the children’s models, it was expected
that individual characteristics such as age and gender, household
characteristics such as income and household size, dwelling char-
acteristics such as dwelling type and tenure, and place characteris-
tics such as metropolitan population size would in<U+FB02>uence workers’
mode to work. A few additional variables were included in the
commute models pertaining to the nature of work: namely, occu-
pation, <U+FB02>ex time, and part-time/full-time distinction. It was ex-
pected that manufacturing workers would drive to work more
because of the location of manufacturing plants in areas with
low transit service, and sales/service workers would drive more be-
cause of the need to use personal vehicles for work-related trips.
Workers with <U+FB02>ex time were expected to drive less because of low-
er time constraints, and full-time workers were expected to drive
more because of greater time constraints.
A variable that has often been included in mode-choice models
requires further discussion. While a number of studies on chil-
dren’s mode choice (e.g., McDonald, 2008a, 2008b; McMillan,
2007; McDonald et al., 2011) include a variable on number of
household vehicles, other studies do not (e.g., Rodríguez and Vogt,
2009; Marshall et al., 2010; Wilson et al., 2010). Similarly, some
studies on adults’ mode choice include a variable on household
vehicle ownership (e.g., Train, 1980; Cervero, 1996, 2002; Maat
and Timmermans, 2009), but others do not (e.g., O’Fallon et al.,
2004; Hensher and Rose, 2007). The assumption in including
household vehicles as an exogenous variable in a mode-choice
model is that households decide to own vehicles irrespective of
how its members need to travel. Based on the number of vehicles
available and other needs, members decide what mode to choose
for a trip. However, it can be reasonably argued that households’
decision to own vehicles is in<U+FB02>uenced by how the members need
to travel and, therefore, household vehicles should not be consid-
ered exogenous in a mode-choice model. Based on this assumption,
models presented in this paper exclude household vehicles as an
exogenous variable. However, it should be noted that when a var-
iable on number of vehicles per adult in household is included in
the MNL, probit, and Heckman models on children’s mode, the var-
iable is signi<U+FB01>cant, but the signi<U+FB01>cance levels of the other variable
remain unchanged. The conclusions in this paper, in fact, would be
stronger when the variable is included but, since those results may
be spurious, the models presented in this paper exclude the
variable.

4.3. Probit and MNL models on children’s mode to school

The results from an MNL model and three probit models on
children’s mode to school are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respec-
tively. Table 1 shows the coef<U+FB01>cients and other statistical test re-
sults for two modes, namely household vehicle and walking or

bicycling, where school bus and other modes have been combined
together as the referent category. In contrast, the probit models in
Table 2 show coef<U+FB01>cients and test results for three modes, namely
household vehicle, walk or bicycle, and school bus. In these models
the non-selected modes together constitute the referent category.
The results of the MNL and probit models are consistent with
past studies. The direction of a few coef<U+FB01>cients in the MNL model
and the probit models is different only because the dependent vari-
ables have different referent categories. The MNL model and the
probit model on walking or bicycling show that children’s propen-
sity to walk or bicycle to school decreases with distance to school.
Both models also show that the propensity to use a household
vehicle is the highest when the distance between home and school
is between a half mile and 1 mile. Beyond 1 mile, trips are more
likely to be made by school bus. Thus parents or caregivers are
more likely to drop off children at school at a moderate distance
and less likely to do so when schools are far away.
The MNL and probit models show that younger children (age 5–
9) are less likely to walk or bicycle and more likely to be driven to
school than older children (age 10–15). Similarly, the models show
that male children are more likely to walk or bicycle and less likely
to be driven to school than female children. Evidence is found from
the models that schools’ walk-alone restriction decreases the like-
lihood of walking or bicycling and increases the use of motorized
modes. Public school students are more likely to walk, bicycle, or
take a school bus and less likely to be driven to school than private
school students. The models show evidence that children from sin-
gle-parent households are more likely to be driven to school than
children from other households, but the in<U+FB02>uence of single-parent-
hood on walking or bicycling is less clear. Evidence is found that
having other school-age children in a household increases the pro-
pensity of walking or bicycling and decreases the likelihood of
being driven to school.
Among the three variables on parents’ perception of children’s
travel to school, the effect of a serious concern about traf<U+FB01>c speed
on children’s mode is the least certain. The models show that a
serious concern about crime is associated with a higher likelihood
of being driven, a higher likelihood of walking or cycling, and lower
likelihood of traveling by school bus. A plausible explanation for
the positive association between serious concern about crime
and a higher likelihood of walking and bicycling is that more chil-
dren walk and bicycle in high-crime urban areas because of habit-
uation despite parental concerns about crime. The models show
that serious concern about traf<U+FB01>c volume reduces the propensity
to walk or bicycle and increases the propensity of school bus use.
The effect of household income on the likelihood of being dri-
ven to school and school bus use is clearer than its effect on walk-
ing or bicycling. As expected, the likelihood of being driven to
school increases with household income, whereas the likelihood
of using a school bus decreases with income. Children from the
lowest-income households walk less, whereas children from the
highest-income households walk more. Thus the trade-off between
modes for high-income and low-income households appears to
take place predominantly between private vehicles and school
s        buses, with walking and bicycling being less relevant. At the lowest
income level, children may walk or bicycle less because of busing,
whereas at the highest income level children may walk or bicycle
more because of greater awareness about their health bene<U+FB01>ts or
better neighborhood quality.
The only consistent evidence regarding dwelling characteristics
is that children living in single detached homes are more likely to
be driven to school, and children living in owned homes are less
likely to walk or bicycle to school. Together these variables seem
to indicate that children in low-density neighborhoods are more
likely to be driven to school than in areas with higher density. Afri-
can-American children are less likely to be driven to school and

and sales/service workers are more likely to drive, and workers in
large metropolitan areas are less likely to drive (once again, pre-
sumably because of the greater availability of public transit).
Similar to the selection model in Table 3 on the likelihood of
adults driving to work, the outcome models on children’s mode
in Table 4 are consistent with expectations. Since the signs and
the level of signi<U+FB01>cance of the variables in the three models in Ta-
ble 4 are almost identical to the probit models on children’s mode
choice in Table 2, they require no further discussion. However, to
examine the effect of adults electing to drive, the sign of q and
the v2 tests on q deserve attention. The v2 tests show that q is sta-
tistically signi<U+FB01>cant at the 1% level in the children’s household
vehicle model, at the 5% level in the school bus model, and at the
10% level in the walk or bicycle model. The signi<U+FB01>cant positive sign
of q in the model on household vehicles for children indicates that
the factors that in<U+FB02>uence adults’ self-selection to drive to work in-
crease the probability of children being driven to work. On the
other hand, the negative signs of q in the walk or bicycle model
and the school bus model indicate that the same forces decrease
the probability of children walking, bicycling, or taking a school
bus.
In addition to the outcome models in Table 4, children’s modes
were also predicted by the Heckman model conditional upon
adults walking or bicycling and taking transit to work. These
models showed expected results. The value of q and the v2 tests
on q from these models are presented in Table 5.

The <U+FB01>rst column of Table 5 shows the modes used by adults in
the selection equation and the subsequent columns show the value
of q and v2 tests for the outcome models on children’s mode. It is
evident from the results that adults’ decision to drive affects all
modes used by children, whereas adults’ decision to take public
transit to work has no effect on children’s modes. Interestingly,
adults’ decision to walk or bicycle is positively associated with
children’s propensity to walk or bicycle, but it has no effect on chil-
dren using the two other modes. Together, these results indicate
that household adults’ choice of driving has a greater effect on chil-
dren’s travel mode to school than any other mode used by adults.

4.5. Does children’s mode to school also affect adults’ mode to work?

The MNL model in Table 1 and the probit models in Table 2
show that when adult workers travel to work by driving household
vehicles, children are more likely to be driven to school and less
likely to walk, bicycle, or take a school bus. Since these models
treated adults’ mode to work as exogenous, they showed only an
association between the two. The Heckman models in Table 4
added an element of causality to this relationship by predicting
adults’ mode through the selection equation and making children’s
mode dependent on that selection.
Although it makes more intuitive sense to hypothesize that
adults in a household choose a lifestyle within which children
adapt and, therefore, children’s mode is more likely to depend on

adults’ mode than adults’ mode on children’s mode, to test if cau-

sality runs in both directions, the selection and outcome equations

of the previously described Heckman model were switched to pre-

dict children’s mode by the selection equation and adults’ mode by

the outcome equation. These models showed that children being

driven to school has no effect on the likelihood of adults driving

to work (q = 0.117, Prob > v2 = 0.143) or adults walking or bicy-

cling to work (q = 0.200, Prob > v2 = 0.147). Similarly, children

walking or bicycling to school has no effect on adults driving to

work (q = 0.108, Prob > v2 = 0.148) or adults walking or bicycling

to work (q = 0.171, Prob > v2 = 0.145). These results provide addi-

tional evidence supporting the hypothesis that adults’ commuting

mode selection affects children’s travel modes and this relation-

ship is mostly unidirectional.


5. Summary of <U+FB01>ndings

Like many past studies, this paper provided results from probit
and multinomial logit models on children’s travel mode to school
by treating distance to school, children’s characteristics, household

characteristics, school characteristics, parents’ perceptions, and
place characteristics as exogenous. These results are consistent
Std.      with past studies. In addition, the paper provided results from
Err.      Heckman probit models to show the relationship between adults’
0.122     mode to work and children’s mode to school. The variables used
in the Heckman models also showed consistency with past studies

0.051     and the probit and MNL models. Together, these models provide
0.055
0.057
evidence that distance to school, children’s age and gender, school
0.047     type, school policies on walking, household income, type of dwell-
0.047     ing, size of metropolitan area, and certain parental perceptions
0.031     in<U+FB02>uence children’s travel mode to school.
0.035
For school of<U+FB01>cials, planners, and researchers concerned about
0.047
0.042     walking and bicycling to school, the study provides some useful
0.017     evidence. First, it shows that schools’ walk-alone restriction re-
0.023     duces the likelihood of walking and bicycling by children. Second,
0.065     public school students are more likely to walk than private school
0.051
students. Third, like many other studies, it shows that the likeli-

0.048     hood of walking and bicycling decreases with distance to school.
0.045     However, when schools are more than a mile away, trips are more
likely to be made by school bus instead of household vehicles.
0.040
Fourth, parents’ perceptions need to be studied more carefully in
0.044
future research because a serious concern about traf<U+FB01>c speed was
0.049     found to have no effect on walking or bicycling, whereas children
0.058     were found to walk and bicycle to school more when parents have
0.042     a serious concern about crime.
0.099
The most signi<U+FB01>cant contribution of this paper is its ability to
0.096
0.058     demonstrate through a system of equations that children’s travel
0.058     mode to school is in<U+FB02>uenced by parents’ travel mode to work. Be-
cause of the structure of the Heckman model, these results can be
0.057
considered at least quasi-causal instead of being completely
0.052
0.044
associative.
The effect of adults’ mode on children’s mode was clearly evi-
0.050     dent when household adults drove to work. The results indicate
that, in lifestyle decisions, adults’ travel mode to work is more fun-

0.044
damental than children’s mode to school. It can be suggested from
0.040
the observed dominance of adults’ mode over children’s mode in

the household decision-making process that future studies should

also consider the travel patterns of household adults when predict-
ing children’s mode to school so that the effects of other variables
are not overestimated.

The evidence presented in this study can help to shape the over-

all transportation planning policies and practices of cities, counties,

and states, as well as the efforts by state departments of transpor-

tation under the federal SRTS program and by the schools partici-
pating in the program. The study’s conclusion that children are less
likely to walk or bicycle when adults in the household drive to

work indicates that policies and practices that affect driving to

work also affect children’s mode to school. Thus, free or subsidized

parking at work, high capacity of roads relative to traf<U+FB01>c volume,

low employment density, and low gasoline tax can all be expected

to decrease walking and bicycling to school by children, whereas

developing land in a manner that promotes walking by adults to

work could potentially increase walking and bicycling to school

by children. The results suggest that promoting public transit op-

tions for commuting by adults may have no discernible impact

on children’s walking or bicycling to school.

The observed association between adults’ travel mode to work

and children’s mode to school should also make those involved

in promoting walking and bicycling under the SRTS program aware

that improving walking and bicycling environments around
schools cannot entirely determine whether children will walk or
bicycle to school. While they may be important to a certain degree,
ultimately how children travel to school also depends on how the
adults in their households travel to work. Given the interconnec-
tion between adults’ travel to work and household children’s travel
to school, it may be necessary to let parents play a signi<U+FB01>cant role
