inter-household similarities in behaviors that are spatially structured.

of the mode choice decision process; school travel mode may de-
pend on whether a child travels alone, with friends, or is escorted
by an adult or other caregiver (Mitra, 2013). The relationship be-
tween these intra-household travel interactions and mode choice
for school transportation remains understudied in the current lit-
erature (McDonald, 2008a; McDonald and Aalborg, 2009; Lin and
Chang, 2010; Vovsha and Petersen, 2005; Yarlagadda and Sriniva-
san, 2008).
Lastly, the emerging child-youth-friendly planning practice in
Canada (e.g., Metrolinx, 2009; OPPI, 2009) is not supported ade-
quately by local knowledge on this topic. Evidence suggests that
planning interventions such as SRTS and STP programs are not nec-

essarily universally successful, a point that supports the need to
explore local barriers and enabling social and environmental qual-

ities adequately (Buliung et al., 2011). Unfortunately, local evi-

dence of the correlates of school travel outcome that can and

should inform policy development in a Canadian context is limited

(Mitra et al., 2010a; Larsen et al., 2012).

This study examines the potential in<U+FB02>uence of the neighbor-

hood environment and spatial autocorrelation on walking for

school transportation. It also investigates the effect of the care-

giver-child travel interactions on travel outcomes. School travel

behavior of 11-year-old children (5th/6th grade) in Toronto, Can-

ada, was explored. The research advances current knowledge on

school transportation behavior, and provides local evidence to in-

form current policy in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area

(GTHA), which is Canada’s largest and most populous urban region.

The <U+FB01>ndings also provide an essential comparative link to other

international case studies, one that facilitates testing of our

hypothesis regarding the importance of local knowledge develop-

ment and use in support of local planning.



2. Study design


The study area is the City of Toronto, Canada’s largest city by

population. Toronto has a vibrant and dense central city (i.e., the

downtown surrounded by inner-city neighborhoods). The inner-

city neighborhoods that comprise the pre-politically amalgamated

Toronto1 are typically dominated by medium-density main street

developments (i.e., residential neighborhoods with commercial and

employment-related land uses along the main streets). Many neigh-

borhoods in the central city have experienced some re-urbanization

(i.e., increased density and land-use diversity) and re-vitalization

(e.g., improvements in the physical conditions of the buildings)

during the last several decades, a trend that has been accelerated

in recent years by favorable public policy and market conditions.

In contrast, modernist conventional neighborhoods dominate subur-

ban areas that were developed after 1945 (i.e., the places that

became part of the city after the political amalgamation in 1998).

The literature on metropolitan growth popularly de<U+FB01>nes this type

of suburban places as the inner-suburbs or inner-ring suburbs within
the larger regional landscape (Lee and Leigh, 2005). These suburban
neighborhoods were designed, for the most part, based on the
neighborhood unit concept with schools at the center (Filion and
Hammond, 2003; Hess, 2009). The inner-city and suburban neigh-
borhoods also contain pockets of single-use, high-rise apartment
buildings built between the 1960s and 1980s (i.e. the tower neigh-
borhoods). These central-city and suburban places, which have

The Amalgamation Bill (Bill 103, the City of Toronto Act) was presented by the
Province of Ontario, Canada, in 1996 and was implemented from January 1, 1998. This
municipal amalgamation merged one regional (Metro Toronto) and six municipal
governments (The former City of Toronto, and <U+FB01>ve other suburban municipalities -

forming the current boundary of the City of Toronto (Hess and Milroy, 2006; Sewell,

developed over the past two centuries, represent a large diversity
in built-environment characteristics that are often identi<U+FB01>ed both
in the popular and academic literatures as either enablers or barriers
to active transportation.
Previous research has reported that 49% of 11–13 year-old chil-
dren in Toronto walked or biked to school in 2006; however, AST
uptake has been declining over the past 25 years (Buliung et al.,
2009). In addition, the current rate sits well below the target of
60%, as indicated in the regional transportation plan for the GTHA
(Metrolinx, 2009).


2.1. Data


Travel data were taken from the 2006 Transportation Tomorrow

Survey (TTS), which is a repeat cross-sectional survey of travel

behavior in Southern Ontario, Canada, that includes the City of Tor-

onto. The survey has been conducted every <U+FB01>ve years since 1986.

The 2006 version, the latest of the series with available data, in-

cludes a 5.2% random sample of all households in the study area

(150,000 households in total; 51,612 households in Toronto), and

reports travel behavior data (e.g., origin/destination, trip start time,

purpose, primary travel mode) for a randomly selected weekday in

fall or winter (Data Management Group, 2009). Retrospective data

for all trips by household members aged P11 years, associated

with the day prior to the interview, were proxy reported by an

adult household member.

Home-to-school trips taken between the 06h00–09h30 time

interval, by 11-year-old children (i.e., likely 5th/6th Grade) were

analyzed; data on younger children were not available, and older

children/youth were excluded with an expectation that school

travel behavior may change when children make the transition
to the middle or high school. Only children traveling to public
and Catholic schools were studied,2 these schools accounted for

88% of sampled school trips. The TTS survey collected household so-
cio-demographic data, with information on intra-household travel

interactions also available (Table 1). Data were developed from the

survey to examine caregiver availability for escort during the school

travel period. Previous research found an association between

maternal travel patterns and a child’s school travel mode (McDonald,

2008a; Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008); father’s and mother’s

travel could not be examined separately here due to the absence

of kinship ties information in the survey data.

Data on the neighborhood built environment came from public

and private sources; these sources are described in Table 1. Built

environment characteristics were measured within a 400-m

straight line buffer distance of each child’s home and school loca-

tions, a distance that is equivalent to a 5-min walking distance

for a child. This spatial unit of analysis is consistent with what

some other researchers have used to explore school travel behavior

(McMillan, 2007; Mitra et al., 2010a; Schlossberg et al., 2006;

Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008).


2.2. Logit models of mode choice

Multinomial (conditional) logit models (MNL) were estimated
to explore the correlates of four travel modes (walk, transit, school
bus, and car). Other excluded modes constituted less than 1% of all

2
Toronto’s faith-based schools (i.e., Roman Catholic) are publicly funded. Until

1998, these Catholic schools were governed by the Metropolitan Separate School
Board. In 1998, the Toronto Catholic School Board (TCDSB) was established, and it
now operates 102 schools in the City of Toronto (Toronto Catholic District School
Board, 2011). Both the public and Catholic school boards in Toronto maintain a small
distance threshold for each school, and children/youth largely attend schools that are
closest to their home locations. In contrast, a household’s choice of a private/ special
school for a child is potentially more prone to selection bias.

an explanatory variable (Augustin et al., 1996; Dormann et al.,
2007). The auto-covariate variable captures spatial interaction
among the error terms for each student and his/her neighbors
(Dormann et al., 2007). The approach for diagnosing the presence
of spatial effects was as follows: <U+FB01>rst, for each child, the residual
for walk mode was computed by subtracting the predicted mode
choice probability from a dummy indicator of the observed mode
choice (i.e., 1 if a child walked to school, 0 otherwise) (Fosgerau,
2008). Next, a spatial weight matrix was computed, with a maxi-
mum number of neighbors kmaximum = 20. The weight matrix re-
<U+FB02>ects the conceptualization of a distance-related in<U+FB02>uence
between nearest neighbors on school travel decisions and out-
comes. An inverse-distance-based conceptualization (i.e., 1d, where
d = network distance between household locations, 63.2 km) was
adopted to generate this spatial weight matrix. A global analysis
of spatial autocorrelation (i.e., global Moran’s I) using this matrix
produced statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (p < 0.01) results, indicating the
presence of spatial dependency among the residuals.
The auto-covariate parameter for an individual student i was
then calculated as a weighted average of the residual values from
the nearest neighbors of i’s home location (Augustin et al., 1996):

such parameters were calculated for each child (home and school-
end). The resulting AUTO_COV variables were then used in the mul-
tivariate analysis. A statistically signi<U+FB01>cant AUTO_COV coef<U+FB01>cient

represents the un-confounded (i.e., adjusted) correlation between

walk mode choice and any unobservable effects that are spatially
structured. The intention of this research was to investigate, in an
exploratory manner, the potential in<U+FB02>uence of spatial autocorrela-
tion on school travel mode-choice behavior. The proposed method


begins to improve our current understanding on this subject, within
a context where there is no widely acknowledged method for this
purpose (Dormann et al., 2007; Sidharthan et al., 2011).


3. Results and discussion


Mode-choice behavior was analyzed for the journey to school of

children who lived within 3.2 km of their schools. The convergence
of the models was satisfactory. Distance was the most important
factor that explained mode choice for school transportation, fol-
lowed by variables related to intra-household travel interactions
(Table 3). Environmental characteristics, collectively, had a rela-
tively smaller impact on model <U+FB01>t. The built environment corre-
lates of school travel modes are introduced <U+FB01>rst here, followed
by intra-household travel interaction-related <U+FB01>ndings, and then
other in<U+FB02>uences.

3.1. The built environment

Distance between home and school locations remained an
important factor after controlling for other variables, con<U+FB01>rming
<U+FB01>ndings from past research (Ewing et al., 2004; McDonald,
2008b; Schlossberg et al., 2006) (Table 4). The distance effect sup-
ports the case for smaller neighborhood schools, particularly in a
dense urban area such as Toronto, as a means to increase AST rates
(McDonald, 2008b; Mitra et al., 2010a). Beyond distance, built
environment near both home and school locations, and the charac-
teristics of the travel route, were also associated with walking. A
neighborhood environment that is expected to provide a sense of
personal and traf<U+FB01>c safety, such as no major streets en-route to
school, and higher land-use mix (i.e., more retail/service related
land use and, hence, more ‘‘eyes on street’’), increased the odds
of walking. These results are comparable to other studies (McMil-
lan, 2007; Panter et al., 2010). Home and school neighborhoods

particularly weak in predicting the travel behavior of students
who, for instance, lived within the tower-neighborhoods that are
commonly found in suburban Toronto. Insert 4 in Fig. 1 demon-
strates an example. The Tower Neighborhoods were largely built
during the 1960–80 period; and there are approximately 1200
apartment towers in the City of Toronto, which represent 48% of
the city’s rental housing stock. These towers were built as a result
of urban policies that encouraged the ‘‘tower in the park’’ housing
model: high-density apartment clusters in the newer suburban
neighborhoods (E.R.A., 2010). The towers are often clustered to-
gether within one or more super-blocks, forming neighborhoods
of their own (hence, the tower neighborhoods).
The poor match between modeled walking propensity and the
actual travel outcome in these tower neighborhoods points to a
broader problem related to the use of objectively measured built
environment characteristics in understanding mode choice behav-
ior. Empirical research in urban planning tends to measure neigh-
borhood design qualities in terms of a combination of individual
characteristics such as grid versus curvilinear streets, mixed versus
segregated land use, and small versus large blocks. The range of
these measures is usually set by traditional central-city (e.g., grid
streets, mixed land use, small blocks) and conventional suburban
(e.g., curvilinear streets, segregated land use, large blocks) neigh-
borhoods. The qualities of other neighborhoods are determined
based on where they <U+FB01>t along this continuum. This approach was

applied in this study, and the built environment measures rela-
tively accurately predicted walking mode choice for typical cen-
tral-city or suburban neighborhood types. However, the results
were less accurate at the intersection of neighborhoods that, as a
whole, did not <U+FB01>t well to the abovementioned ‘‘typical’’ measures
of design qualities, but are rather common neighborhood types
in the context of a large North American city (e.g., the tower/apart-
ment-neighborhoods). In Toronto, the average household income
in most tower-neighborhoods is low. Thus, socio-economic factors
may dictate walking in a less-than-ideal environment (Hess and
Farrow, 2010). However, it is possible that these neighborhoods
are indeed walkable due to their social (e.g., everyone walks) and
physical (e.g., informal pathways) settings, even though some de-
sign elements (larger blocks, auto-oriented street design, lack of
land-use mix) are assumed, by convention, to discourage walking.
In addition to neighborhood characteristics, the auto-covariate
parameter was positively associated with walking. While the exact

conclusively in this research, the result warrants some informed
speculation with regard to meaning. First, this study examined
several neighborhood characteristics, but there may be other
important characteristics (objective or perceived) that remain
unexplored, that speaks to one of the root causes underlying the
presence of spatial dependence. The auto-covariate parameter esti-
mate may describe spatial variation in travel outcome related to

these potentially unexplored characteristics. Second, the
AUTO_COV coef<U+FB01>cient may capture any form of social norm/mod-
eling behavior around travel mode that operates at the local neigh-
borhood level and is adopted by the households living in a
neighborhood. Lastly, household mode-choice behavior can also
be in<U+FB02>uenced by household attitudes toward travel or the built
environment (Boarnet and Crane, 2001; Cao et al., 2009; Kitamura
et al., 1997; Yang et al., 2012). A household may choose to live in a
walkable or a drivable neighborhood based on its choice or prefer-
ence (commonly known as ‘‘self-selection’’ in urban planning liter-
ature). Collectively, then, similar school-travel outcomes within
close proximity may re<U+FB02>ect common household attitudes about
housing, amenities, and transport. The potential relationship be-
tween neighborhood self-selection, transport norms, and AST has
yet to be addressed systematically in the literature.

3.2. Intra-household travel interactions

An association was found between a child’s school travel mode
and the travel characteristics of other household members (Ta-
ble 4), which is broadly similar to what has been reported in lim-
ited previous research (McDonald, 2008a; McDonald and Aalborg,
2009; Lin and Chang, 2010; Vovsha and Petersen, 2005; Yarlagadda
and Srinivasan, 2008). In particular, our <U+FB01>ndings support the
‘‘availability’’ hypothesis discussed earlier in this paper, and indi-
cate that when an adult caregiver was available at home at the
time of school travel, a child was more likely to be escorted to
school, increasing the odds of a car trip. In contrast, the absence
of an adult caregiver, and hence the possibility of independent
mobility (i.e., travel without an accompanying adult caregiver), in-
creased the likelihood of walking, taking transit, or riding a school
bus. Additionally, in a household with two or more children travel-
ing to school, the odds of taking a non-auto mode was higher, com-
pared to a single-child household. Perhaps, in many households
where multiple children are aged P 11 years, the children accom-
pany each other instead of being escorted by adults. In addition, car
trips were more common among children from auto-dependent
households (Table 4). This observation is not surprising in the con-
text of evidence suggesting that, given a <U+FB01>xed number of daily
household activities, dependency on one travel mode (in this case,
private automobile) for some daily activities (e.g., work) may dis-
courage the use of other modes of travel to other destinations
(e.g., school) (Cervero and Radisch, 1996).

3.3. Other potential in<U+FB02>uences

A household’s access to private automobiles increased the odds
of a car trip (Table 4). By contrast, access to transit was not associ-
ated with transit mode choice. Also at the age of 11 years, there

was no difference in walking between boys and girls, a result that

is similar to what has been reported in some recent studies
(Johansson et al., 2012; McDonald, 2012; Mitra and Buliung,

2012). Children going to Catholic schools were more likely to take

a school bus compared to those going to public schools. Seasonality

(WINTER) was not associated with mode choice of these elemen-

tary school children, which con<U+FB01>rms the <U+FB01>ndings from previous

research (Mitra and Faulkner, 2012; Sirard et al., 2005).


4. Implications for policy and practice

In the U.S., the Federal government has devoted $862 million
since 2005 to the implementation of Safe Routes to School (SRTS)
programs (NCSRS, 2010). This centralized (Federal) funding model
to school transportation planning is not the norm in Canada,
re<U+FB02>ecting a long-standing, piecemeal, often highly politicized

approach to Federal investment in transportation infrastructure
and services in urban Canada. In 2007, a community-based organi-
zation, Green Communities Canada, began implementing a pilot
School Travel Planning (STP) framework across Canada, with <U+FB01>nan-
cial support from the Public Health Agency of Canada (Buliung
et al., 2011; Green Communities Canada, 2013). Key community
stakeholders (school boards, urban/transportation planners, public
health professionals, police, parents, students and teachers) collab-
orate to identify barriers to active transportation for a school, and
develop an action plan to address and overcome those barriers. An
STP may include the implementation of transportation infrastruc-
ture (e.g., pedestrian crossings, bike-racks), educational programs
(e.g., safety of pedestrians and cyclists), community mobilization
programs (e.g., walking school bus), and encouragement programs
(e.g., event days) (Green Communities Canada, 2013).
From 2009 to 2011, the provincial transportation authority for
the GTHA, the Metrolinx (2011), partnered with Green Communi-
ties Canada in implementing the ‘‘Stepping it Up’’ initiative, which
introduced the STP model to 30 grade schools across the region.
This pilot program received funding from Transport Canada. Since
2011, no longer-term revenue stream has been identi<U+FB01>ed. How-
ever, Metrolinx continues to support walking, cycling, and transit
use for school transportation through community mobilization.
Within this context, a better understanding of the correlates of
school travel mode choice can be important in identifying loca-
tional foci for school and community-level interventions, with a
view to optimizing expenditure from limited program resources.
Findings from this study may inform development of speci<U+FB01>c inter-
ventions within the broader scope of STP initiatives. At the munic-
ipality level, the planning and design of the neighborhoods and
school policy may also play potentially important roles in enabling
AST among children. The main lessons from this work are:

4.1. The built environment near both home and school locations is
important

Canadian STP initiatives emphasize changes to the built envi-
ronment at and near schools. Results from this study indicated that
environmental interventions may increase walking school trips,
but these interventions could be effective if implemented at the
home and/or school end. In other words, considerations for AST
should be incorporated in the neighborhood planning practice,
above and beyond the STP exercise. Neighborhoods with smaller
blocks, higher land-use mix (retail and residential), and more local
streets increased the odds of walking in Toronto. Some other trans-
portation infrastructures (e.g., density of intersections with signal-
lights, dead-end streets) were not correlated with walking.


4.2. Expectation regarding design-based interventions should be

modest


The design concerns explored in this study, however, only

explained part of the spatial variation in school travel mode choice

outcomes in Toronto, similar to what has been observed in other

places. Expectations regarding the success of a design-based

intervention, therefore, should be modest. In addition, results from

this research indicate that city-wide modeling of travel behavior,
and planning practice based on those model results, may perform
poorly with regard to understanding and changing mode-choice
outcomes within places that are poorly matched to the conven-
tional design perspectives concerning ‘‘walkable’’ and ‘‘non-
walkable’’ neighborhoods. Initiatives such as STP should give
particular importance to exploring environment-travel interac-
tions within neighborhoods that do not conform to design-place
stereotypes (e.g., tower-neighborhoods in the suburbs).

4.3. Promoting independent travel may increase the rates of walking

Current research has demonstrated that children’s independent
mobility, or freedom to explore their neighbourhood unsupervised,
has important implications for their physical, social, and psycho-
logical development (Carver et al., 2008; Prezza and Pacilli, 2007;
Tranter and Whitelegg, 1994). The importance of independent
mobility is beginning to be recognized in Canada (Active Healthy
Kids Canada, 2013). Independent mobility, at least conceptually,
can also be linked to AST (Mitra, 2013). Obviously, when children
are traveling independently, they are likely not being driven. The
results from this study support this hypothesis by suggesting indi-
rectly that children who were escorted by adult caregivers were
more likely to be driven to school. It appears that programs that
encourage independent or autonomous traveling to school (i.e.,
not accompanied by adult caregivers) could potentially enable
AST. For example, community mobilization that encourages school
travel without direct adult supervision while ensuring adult pres-
ence (e.g., walking school bus) may increase rates of walking in
Toronto. These community initiatives may particularly target
stay-home (or part-time working) caregivers who usually accom-
pany their children during school travel, and encourage them to
lead walking groups, act as volunteers, or even as crossing guards.

4.4. School policy has a potentially important role in the promotion of
AST

A limited existing research has documented an association be-
tween school types and walking. For example, children attending
choice schools (i.e., public schools where attendance is not tied
to the neighborhood of residence) are more likely to be driven
compared to neighborhood public schools, largely because of the
differences in typical travel distance and parental attitudes toward
a child’s mobility (Yang et al., 2012). In the context of Toronto, it
appears that the governance of school transport may indeed have
a major role in moderating mode choice at the individual level.
Students attending Catholic schools were more likely to travel by
school bus, compared to students in public schools, perhaps due
to the <U+FB02>exible school transportation policy of the Catholic school
board. While Toronto’s public schools apply a strictly implemented
distance threshold to limit service eligibility, Catholic schools are
more <U+FB02>exible in applying their distance policy for busing. Trans-
portation is often provided to students living less than 1.5 km from
school, arguably to encourage students to attend Catholic neigh-
borhood schools with dwindling attendance.

5. Limitations

This research draws attention to some broader limitations of an
empirical investigation in understanding the relationship between
the built environment and travel behavior. First, some spatial
variation in mode-choice behavior was correlated with unobserv-
able characteristics likely shared among neighboring households.
Further research focused on localized variation in perceptions,
attitudes, and social norms around transportation decisions is
likely to be a useful direction for additional study. Second, the built
environment correlates were less accurate for the neighborhoods
that generally did not <U+FB01>t well with the ‘‘typical’’ qualities of a tra-
ditional central-city or a conventional suburban neighborhood. In
addition, with regard to the observable built environment charac-
teristics, previous research has reported mixed results regarding
the association between sidewalks and the odds of walking (Ewing
et al., 2004; McMillan, 2007). However, most streets in Toronto
have sidewalks. Conceptually, then, sidewalks may not be an
important factor that explains the difference in walking rates
of Transport Geography 36 (2014) 69–78


across space within the Toronto metropolitan area. At the time of
analysis, data on informal footpaths, shortcuts, or pathways (i.e.,
those that are not formally planned or managed by the city) were
also not available. Conceivably, such informal infrastructures
would offer opportunities for active travel for children in any
neighborhood (Buliung et al., 2013; Fusco et al., 2012). In the con-
text of our study, informal shortcuts or pathways may, at least
partly, explain unexpected walking rates in some inner-suburban
neighborhoods in Toronto, as discussed in Section 3.1. A closer
examination of this topic remains subject to future research.
Findings from this research also begin to provide insights into
the relationship between travel negotiations among household
members and school travel-mode choice. However, the behavioral
processes that determine or moderate such negotiations could not
be fully investigated here. Broader behavioral understandings may
emerge through further quantitative and qualitative exploration of
school travel within the context of a household’s activity-travel de-
mands and constraints.


6. Conclusion

This study adopted a geographically weighted modeling
approach to investigate school travel-mode choice in Toronto,
Canada’s largest city by population. Quantitative models were esti-
mated using data from a large and population-representative
transportation survey. First, with regard to the neighborhood envi-
ronment, our results indicate that built environment characteris-
tics related to safety and neighborhood aesthetics/walkability
explained mode choice, even when travel distance was controlled.
Second, with regard to the intra-household travel interactions, the
results suggest that the availability of caregivers at the time of
school travel, which perhaps facilitated escorted school trips, was
associated with driving. The presence of siblings aged P 11 years,
on the contrary, was associated with walking and the use of transit.
Lastly, with regard to the universality of the enablers and barriers
to AST, our results related to the neighborhood environment were
largely similar to what has been reported previously. However,
these <U+FB01>ndings were not generalizable to all neighborhoods within
Toronto. The predicted built environment effects were more accu-
rate in some types of neighborhood, but relatively less accurate in
some other types of neighborhoods, a <U+FB01>nding that emphasizes the
importance of exploring environment-AST interactions at the local
level. In addition, students going to Catholic schools were more
likely to take a school bus compared to students in public schools,
perhaps re<U+FB02>ecting the less spatially rigid busing strategy of Toron-
to’s Catholic school board.
Our <U+FB01>ndings improve current knowledge on the correlates of
AST, challenge the assumptions around the generalizability of ob-
served built environment effects across all neighborhood types,
and provide local evidence that may inform school transportation
planning practice, such as the STP initiative, in Canada. The study
also advances school transportation research by addressing the
spatial autocorrelation problem in a quantitative investigation of
school travel behavior. There are potential bene<U+FB01>ts in extending
the proposed conceptual and methodological approach in the
exploration of school travel, childhood mobility, and physical
activity. An improved knowledge of these potentially modi<U+FB01>able
human behaviors could bene<U+FB01>t policy that is focused on healthy
and sustainable urban communities.
