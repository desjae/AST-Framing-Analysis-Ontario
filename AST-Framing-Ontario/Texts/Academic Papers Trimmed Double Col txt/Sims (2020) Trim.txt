    for AT were also measured. Logistic regressions predicted child AT to school based on parental AT                        social environment
    behavior and beliefs. Parents (n ¼ 344) were primarily white (85.8%), female (66.3%), overweight or
    obese (48.0%) and married (82.6%), with high levels of income and education and reported that
    12.2% (n ¼ 41) of their children were active travelers. Children had higher odds of AT to school if
    the parent actively traveled (Odds ratio [OR] ¼ 1.23 [1.12–1.34], p<.001) or the spouse was an
    active traveler (OR ¼ 1.28 [1.14–1.45], p<.001). Speaking with children about reasons for AT (OR ¼
    1.61 [1.19–2.18], p¼.002), children being eager to actively travel to school (OR ¼ 4.20 [2.82–6.25],
    p<.001), and parental AT as a child (OR ¼ 1.29 [1.03–1.60], p¼.02) were associated with more AT,
    and odds of children actively traveling to school were lower with higher parent body mass index
    (OR ¼ 0.87 [0.79–0.96], p¼.005) and more cars in the household (OR ¼ 0.47 [0.30–0.72], p¼.001).
    These findings suggest that children’s AT to school is directly influenced by the travel behavior,
    attitudes, and beliefs of parents.
