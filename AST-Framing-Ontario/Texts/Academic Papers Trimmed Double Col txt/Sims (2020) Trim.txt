Active travel (AT) is associated with improved health in adults and children, and children’s AT to                      Received 12 January

behavior and beliefs. Parents (n ¼ 344) were primarily white (85.8%), female (66.3%), overweight or
obese (48.0%) and married (82.6%), with high levels of income and education and reported that
12.2% (n ¼ 41) of their children were active travelers. Children had higher odds of AT to school if
the parent actively traveled (Odds ratio [OR] ¼ 1.23 [1.12–1.34], p<.001) or the spouse was an
active traveler (OR ¼ 1.28 [1.14–1.45], p<.001). Speaking with children about reasons for AT (OR ¼

and odds of children actively traveling to school were lower with higher parent body mass index
(OR ¼ 0.87 [0.79–0.96], p¼.005) and more cars in the household (OR ¼ 0.47 [0.30–0.72], p¼.001).
These findings suggest that children’s AT to school is directly influenced by the travel behavior,
attitudes, and beliefs of parents.

Due to the marked declines in AT among children,

understanding the influences on AT will inform intervention

development to increase AT among youth. Further, as

parents have a major influence on their children’s health

and health behaviors, it is important to examine how paren-

tal AT and related correlates predict AT among their chil-

dren. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the
relationship between AT of children to school and parental
AT behavior and beliefs.


Methods

This was a cross-sectional study of employed adults con-

ducted via an online survey distributed using Qualtrics soft-

ware (Provo, UT). Data were collected from June to

December 2011. Detailed methods are published elsewhere

(Bopp, Kaczynski, & Campbell, 2013).


Participants and recruitment

Recruitment took place primarily in the mid-Atlantic United

States (PA, OH, WV, MD, NJ, and DE). This was a conveni-

ence sample of employees who worked for large employers

in the regions (e.g., school districts and local/regional gov-

ernment) who were willing to help in recruiting participants.

Individuals over the age of 18, who were employed outside
the home, and were physically able to walk or bike, were eli-
gible for participation in the study. Individuals who reported
having one or more school-aged children living at home
with them were included in the present study.


Measures

Parent travel modes

Participants reported the number of times per week walked,
biked, driven, or took public transit to and from work for
themselves and their spouses. The number of total trips was
summed and parents were categorized as an active traveler
if they reported one or more trip/week via walking or bik-
ing. One or more trip a week was used to classify active
travel status due to the distribution of responses among
those who reported any AT trips; the none/any dichotomi-

zation was most reflective of responses.


Demographics and health

Participants reported on their sex, marital status, education
level, age, number of cars in the household, height and
weight (body mass index [BMI] was calculated), number of
chronic health conditions, and their perceived health status
(1 ¼ poor to 5 ¼ excellent).



Psychosocial influences

Spouse normative beliefs for AT were measured using a 5-

point Likert scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree and 5 ¼ strongly

agree) to respond to four statements about AT: “My spouse/

partner and I discuss issues related to walking and biking to

work,” “I value what my spouse/partner thinks about the

way I travel to work,” “I have an opinion on the way my

spouse/partner travels to and from work,” and “My spouse/
partner influences my choice on how I travel to and from
work” (Conn, Tripp-Reimer, & Maas, 2003). Participants
were also asked to report their self-efficacy (confidence) for
bicycling with a 5-point scale (1 ¼ not at all confident to
5 ¼ very confident).
Community and environmental influences: Using a 5-
point Likert scale participants indicated how pedestrian and

bicycle friendly (1 ¼ not at all to 5 ¼ very much) there com-

munity was. Participants indicated (yes/no) the number of

supports for cycling in their community (e.g., bike racks on

public transit, share the road signs), which was summed.
Walk and bike time to work was reported and dichotomized
as </>20 min.
Child travel modes: Participants also reported separately
per child (if applicable) the number of times in a typical week
their children walked, bike, were driven, or took public transit

to and from school, their child’s age and distance to their

school (categorized as 0–0.5 miles, 0.5–1 mile, 1–1.5, and >1.5

miles). Children were categorized as being an active traveler if

they walked or bike to/from school one or more day week,

with the same rationale as described above with parents AT
participation. Finally, participants responded to a series of 12
questions on a five-point scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree and
5 ¼ strongly agree) regarding individual normative beliefs on
AT as it relates to their children (Table 1). Parents were cate-
gorized as having no children that actively travel or having
one or more child that actively travel.


Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics and frequencies described the sample.
Separate logistic regressions were used to predict if a parent
had a child that engaged in AT to school for the parental AT
behavior and beliefs. All analyses were performed using SPSS
23.0 (Armonk, NY). Given the number of analyses conducted,
we used a Bonferroni correction and set significance levels
were set at p < .01.


Results

The demographics of the sample are shown in Table 1. A
total of 1,234 individuals completed the survey, though only
individuals who reported having school aged children
(n ¼ 344, 27.9% of the original sample) were included in the
analyses outlined above.
All results are listed in Table 2. Parents had had higher
odds of having a child who actively traveled to school if the
parent was an active traveler (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 1.23
[1.12–1.34], p < .001) or the parent had a spouse who was

beliefs, parental participation in AT as a child, parental per-
ceived health status, number of chronic diseases in the
parents, parental self-efficacy for biking skills, perceived
community supports for AT, parental/spousal schedule
impacting their child’s travel, believing their child gets
enough PA, and believing their child is too sedentary.


Discussion

This study revealed a number of interesting relationships
between parental AT behavior and beliefs and child AT
behavior. There is strong evidence that participating in AT
results in positive health outcomes for children, underscor-
ing the importance of focusing on AT (Davison et al., 2008;
Lubans, Boreham, Kelly, & Foster, 2011).On the whole,
greater child AT behavior was predicted by greater parental
AT behavior and stronger positive parental AT beliefs. It is
important to understand the influence of parents on their
children’s AT behavior.
Multiple studies have assessed the relationship between
parental PA and child PA, in general finding that more
active children have more active parents (Moore et al., 1991;
Yang, Telama, & Laakso, 1996), and children with active
parents were two to three times as likely to be active as
compared to children with inactive parents. However, lim-
ited research has examined the relationship between parent

AT and child travel mode. Previous work has examined dif-
ferent parental factors related to children’s AT; Cooper,
Page, Foster, and Qahwaji (2003) note that children’s travel
behavior decisions are likely made by the parents. Other
studies have found parental restrictions on children’s move-
ment can influence AT (Henne, Tandon, Frank, & Saelens,
2014). Still, these results point to the importance of further
examining this relationship.
The current study also noted the importance of parental
beliefs for AT to school. In alignment with our results, pre-
vious research has found that greater environmental sup-
ports and parental support for PA correlate with higher
levels of PA among children (Sallis, Prochaska, & Taylor,
2000) and there is a negative correlation between parental
anxiety about environmental safety and children’s PA levels
(Weir, Etelson, & Brand, 2006). These findings highlight the
importance of both the social and physical environment of
the neighborhood as it relates to children’s safety while
being active underscores the importance of perceived versus
actual environment with this population. Communities aim-
ing to address both child and adult active travel should fol-
low frameworks that address a wide range of needs and
abilities, including Complete Streets Initiatives which help to
address planning an infrastructure that help contribute to
perceived safety and decreased pedestrian and cyclist acci-
dents and fatalities (Smart Growth American and National
Complete Streets Coalition, 2016). Safe Routes to School
programs also have the potential to address some of these

barriers, encompassing both the environment through
engineering strategies as well as encouraging behavior
change through education and encouragement (National
Center for Safe Routes to School, 2018). The Safe Routes to
School National Partnership also provides insightful report
cards to states which can provide a foundation for planning
around encouraging AT for children with potential impact
on adults’ AT as well (Lieberman, Pasillas, Pedroso,
Williams, & Zimmerman, 2018). These findings suggest that
efforts to promote AT have implications across multiple age
groups and should consider policy and environmental
change along with programmatic efforts to address beliefs
and social norms.
Our results showed that children have lower odds of
actively traveling if their parents have a high BMI, if there
are more cars in the household, or if more children in the
neighborhood are driven or ride the bus to school. A strong
relationship exists between parental and child obesity, with
more obese children tending to have more obese parents
who tend to be less physically active (Fogelholm, Nuutinen,
Pasanen, My€  oh€anen, & S€a€atel€a, 1999). Accordingly, the rela-
tionship between lack of AT among children and higher
parental BMI is unsurprising. Number of cars in the house-
hold, self-efficacy, and social support for AT have been
noted to be determinants of AT among children in previous
studies, in line with current findings (Black et al., 2001;
Kim, Lee, Lu, & Mendoza, 2017; Panter, Jones, Van Sluijs, &
Griffin, 2010; Panter et al., 2008). The overlap with parental




support and children’s AT was also noted by Mah
et al.(2017), along with the importance of a perceived sup-

portive physical environment. School health professionals
and public health practitioners could apply this information
to develop family-oriented interventions and programs to
build confidence and skills for AT and create social norms

within the family for AT participation. Further studies
should examine a broad range of influences to comprehen-
sively examine what factors could impact children’s AT in
order to develop effective programs to target this behavior.
Despite the significant findings, this study is not without

limitations including the cross-sectional design, volunteer
sample, self-report measures, homogenous sample, and low
rates of AT among participants. Given the low rates of AT
for children we were unable to separate out child specific

trends (e.g., age), limiting our ability to fully understand this

relationship. Additionally we were unable to document other
social influences (e.g., neighborhood cohesion; Salahuddin
et al. 2016) which have been noted to be related to child-
ren’s AT. Also, we did not adjust the analyses for other fac-

tors which could have allowed for determining the most
influential variables. Lastly, the sample was not very ethnic-
ally or economically diverse, limiting our ability to general-
ize our results. This is problematic in that income/education

and race/ethnicity are known to be a significant influence

on AT participation for both children and adults. Further
studies should see to recruit a more diverse sample.
Limitations notwithstanding, results from this study may
be useful in better targeting AT. Not only is this information

useful in promoting existing AT programs for communities
such Safe Routes to School and Complete Streets, this infor-
mation may also prove beneficial in providing preliminary
data for developing AT programs and interventions for

parents to increase rates of AT among their children.

Improvements in education, policy, and environmental
changes supporting AT among both adults and children are
also necessary to ensure improvements in AT behaviors and
beliefs. Initiatives focused on promoting AT among children

have been used around the world; a review of interventions
promoting AT to school noted many environmental and
policy level strategies, though few studies have also included
parent AT habits as a part of their strategies, suggesting a

significant gap in the literature (Pang et al., 2017).

These findings suggest that AT to school among children
is directly influenced by the travel behavior, attitudes, and
beliefs of their parents. These findings also highlight the
importance of improving AT correlates among adults to

increase AT among their children, suggesting the import-

ance of partnerships between community coalitions focused
on AT, schools, worksites, urban planners and public health
officials for addressing walking and biking participation
across the lifespan.
