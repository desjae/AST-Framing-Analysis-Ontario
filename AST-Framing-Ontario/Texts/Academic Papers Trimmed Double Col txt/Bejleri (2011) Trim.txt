Abstract Extensive research in response to the decline of walkability in the past 30 years has identified a
multitude of factors that affect children’s ability to work or bicycle to school. Among others, urban form – the layout
and configurations of urban blocks and street networks - can constraint or facilitate pedestrian travel to a destination
such as a school. Although contemporary research uses approximate measures of walkability such as straight-line
distance between origin and destination, or even measures of distances along roadway networks, the presence of
physical barriers and facilitators to walking calls for a more accurate method for assessing walkability as a function
of distance dictated by constraints of urban form. Modern technologies like Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
offer capabilities to enable calculation of such measures. This article presents a GIS methodology that analyzes
children travel to school as a function of distance along the network and the role of barriers and facilitators that
impact the path and the accessibility to school. The study is conducted in 32 randomly selected elementary schools
in four Florida counties. Three pedestrian sheds of 1/2 mile (10 minutes walk) are generated around each school
based respectively on (a) straight-line distance, (b) roadway network distance and (c) pedestrian network distance
adjusted for barriers such as major roads, and lack of sidewalks and facilitators such as pedestrian paths, crossing
guards and rear entrances to school. The pedestrian sheds are compared based on two measures: (1) pedestrian
route directness (PRD) – an index that measures urban form permeability and connectivity and (2) the student count
in each shed – a measure that indicates how effectively the pedestrian shed captures potential students along these
networks. Results show that the pedestrian shed decreases in size upon considering network distance over straight-
line distance, and readjusts upon consideration of barriers and facilitators. PRD values decrease as the pedestrian
shed is adjusted which indicates shorter, more direct paths to schools are available. Findings suggest that inclusion
of barriers and facilitators when measuring distance along the network offers a more realistic version of the true
distance a child could potentially walk to school. The study found that barriers and facilitators play critical roles in
how the urban landscape can be traversed and, in turn, greatly affect walkability and accessibility to school. Barriers
can reduce walkability and accessibility to school whereas facilitators can increase the permeability and connectivity
of pedestrian networks. In addition to improving walkability measurement methods by enhancing the GIS network
analysis to include barriers and facilitators, this research has broader implications for the study of walkability as it
relates to urban form. The findings can be used by local governments to develop better policies to promote close
coordination of school siting with residential development and transportation. These findings can also inform the
urban design of the layout and configuration of street networks, urban blocks and placement of buildings to support
safe pedestrian circulation with good permeability connectivity and accessibility throughout the neighborhood.
Especially, findings from this study emphasize the importance of designing for connected pedestrian paths that
minimize barriers and maximize facilitators.
