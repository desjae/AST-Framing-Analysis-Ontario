processes that link the factors on these different levels of the
ecological model to the choice of active transport modes. Trying to
overcome this shortcoming, Mitra's framework is informed by
research from three different research <U+FB01>elds and multiple theo-
retical backgrounds where children's transportation has been in
focus, namely, in transportation and urban planning studies, public
health, and environmental psychology. Based on his review, Mitra
builds a behavioural model of school transport (BMST) that is at its
core a socio-ecological model, which looks at the associations
between built environment and behaviour across multiple nested
layers. In addition, the model also contextualises the intra-
household interactions within the household activity-travel fra-
mework, and considers the perceived importance of an escorted
trip, the mobility options available and the activity constraints on
the family.
On the urban environment level, Mitra (2013) identi<U+FB01>es <U+FB01>ve
conceptual domains of relationship between the neighbourhood
environment and school travel outcomes. These domains include
the proximity to school, traf<U+FB01>c and personal safety concerns,
connectivity, comfort and attractiveness, and the possibility to
maintain social capital on the school journey. Previously dis-
covered evidence in respect of the environmental attributes as-
sociated with children's transport choices is then placed under
these conceptual domains and discussed in detail by Mitra.
Of the frameworks described above, we <U+FB01>nd Mitra's (2013)
framework the most thorough in its reasoning and portrayal of the
hypothesised links between urban environment and transport
options in respect of children's journeys to school. In this paper,
we seek to highlight the elements of the urban structure that
promote children's transport to school by foot or by bike, using the
conceptual domains proposed by Mitra to frame the work. We also
ask whether the correlates of walking and cycling differ. It has
been suggested that the correlates for walking and cycling in
terms of school journeys may be different (Kemperman and Tim-
mermans, 2014; De Vries et al., 2010) and hence we treat walking
and cycling to school as two distinct outcome variables rather than
looking at active versus passive travel modes.
Somewhat unusually, we only include subjects living within
distances between one and three kilometres from their school.
Increasing distance has consistently been shown to decrease the
propensity of journeys taken actively (e.g. Su et al., 2013; Pont
et al., 2009; Yeung et al., 2008). In the pupils studied from the
Helsinki region, inactive modes of transport were almost non-
existent (2.8% modal share) on journeys shorter than one kilo-
metre, while previous research shows notably lower shares of
active transport in students living close to school. In the US, the
share of walking was 48% for those living within 1 mile of their
school (McDonald, 2008); while another study reported 32%
walking, 14% cycling, and 54% using car or bus as their primary
transport mode within the same distance (Schlossberg et al.,
2006). In Australia, 23% of students living within 0.75 km of their
school had no active commuting trips in a week (Merom et al.,
2006). Meanwhile, a Dutch study found the share of inactive trips
within 1 km of school to be 10% (Aarts et al., 2012). With regres-
sion analysis, the point is to explain the variance in the outcome
variable (i.e. using inactive modes vs. walking or cycling) by the
variance of the independent variables (i.e. the structure of the built
environment). To be able to explain the variance in school journey
transport modes, we need to concentrate on those trips where it is
not only distance but also the environment that affects the mode
chosen.
This article is, we believe, the <U+FB01>rst to operationalise Mitra's
framework. We use, where available, variables related to the urban
environment already utilised in earlier research and create new

ways of operationalising the domains that have not previously
been studied in detail. In their framework, Panter et al. (2008)
/ Transport Policy 37 (2015) 1–10


recommended that the built environment relating to the neigh-
bourhood, destination, and route environment should be con-
sidered. Research that has empirically studied the destination (i.e.
school) environment and facilities has however shown no sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant associations with children's active travel behaviour (Pan-
ter et al., 2010; Mitra et al., 2010). Thus we concentrate instead on
analysing the urban environments of homes and school journeys
in correlation with the transport modes of children and young
people and leave the destination environment out of our analysis.
Finally, this study adds to the discussion on the associations
between the built environment and AST by exploring this general
theme in the Finnish context. Thus far, this <U+FB01>eld of research has
largely been dominated by research from the US, Canada, Australia
and the UK with occasional examples from other European
countries such as Netherlands (e.g. Aarts et al., 2012; Kemperman
and Timmermans, 2014).



2. Material and methods

Recent developments in GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
and especially in public participation GIS (PPGIS) have created new
opportunities for the use of location-based methodologies. The
softGIS methodology is one example of a PPGIS method that en-
ables the collection of large datasets of residents' experiential
knowledge concerning various environments (Kyttä and Kahila,
2011). The main bene<U+FB01>t of utilising location-based surveys in data
collection concerning daily mobility and environmental experi-
ences is the geographical dimension the data maintains. Based on
the coordinates, the experiential knowledge gathered from re-
sidents can be simultaneously analysed with register-based GIS
data, which provides new, location-based research possibilities
(Kahila and Kyttä, 2009).
The data relating to this study was collected via a softGIS sur-
vey for children, where the respondents used the Internet inter-
face to mark their home and daily routes to school, and to answer
questionnaires concerning school journeys, perceived health and
wellbeing as well as background details. The method has been
tested in previous research among both children (Kyttä et al.,
2012; Broberg et al., 2013) and adults. The user interface included
a set of questionnaire pages where conventional survey question
and mapping pages alternated (see Fig. 1)1. Additionally, the re-
spondents were asked to mark places that were functionally,
emotionally or socially meaningful, and to describe how accessible
these places were, in terms of independent mobility and active
transport. This article concentrates on children's school journeys,
while the data relating to meaningful places will be reported
elsewhere.


2.1. Subjects and communities

This article studies the school journeys of two select age groups
in a small but rapidly growing metropolitan area, the capital re-
gion of Finland. The research data was collected in 16 compre-
hensive schools (in total 22 5th grade classes and 38 8th grade
classes) during the autumn and early winter of 2011. The schools
and their surrounding residential areas included represent differ-
ent urban structures ranging from the inner city urban core to
surrounding suburbs, and fringe areas dominated by single-family
housing.

Australia and Japan. For ease of understanding, in Fig. 1 the Australian version of
the questionnaire is depicted instead of the one in Finnish.

2.2.2.2. Variables related to traf<U+FB01>c safety and personal safety.


Numerous variables concerning the traf<U+FB01>c environment have been
9.26           3.68                    used in previous research on children's transportation. In this
study, streetlight density (Panter et al., 2010) and proportion of
2.56           0.74

intersections with street lights were used (Mitra and Buliung,
40.22          23.19                   2012).
The presence of primary roads was operationalised as their
57.58          26.46                   proportion of total roads (Panter et al., 2010) and as the length of

14.21          10.38
major roads by area near home and along school journey (Mitra
and Buliung, 2012). We also analysed whether or not a major road
or railroad intersects the school journey (Schlossberg et al., 2006).
6.21           3.68                        Mitra (2013) hypothesizes that large retail centres or employ-

ment districts may discourage AST. Previous research in relation to

Helsinki has shown that environments dominated by high build-
ing densities discourage active and independent mobility (Broberg
4.73           7.00

et al., 2013). Building density was calculated as the summed <U+FB02>oor
4.16           7.06                    space in all the buildings within a buffer divided by the area (Lin
and Yu, 2011). The proportion of land covered by public buildings
22.89          15.48                   near home (Su et al. 2013) was also calculated.

Also the distance of the drawn journey (DIST_DRAWN) was calculated, but as

objective and less sensitive to differences between respondents in the meticu-
lousness of drawing the route.

It has been suggested (Mitra, 2013; Ding et al., 2011) that a
mixed design and associated presence of street-level retail and
‘eyes on the street’ could encourage AST. We calculated the mix in
the main uses of buildings (as de<U+FB01>ned for land use mix by Frank
et al., 2004).

2.2.2.3. Connectivity-related variables. Previous research highlights
the existence of contrasting evidence in relation to the associa-
tions between pedestrian connectivity or intersection densities
and children's active transportation (e.g. Wong et al., 2011).
Nevertheless, we calculated the ratio of 4-way intersections to
total number of street intersections (Mitra and Buliung, 2012). Two
variables concerning the overall availability of roads to walk or
cycle and the connectivity of these roads were calculated. Road
density (Panter et al., 2010) and intersection density (Schlossberg
et al., 2006) were calculated for both home and route
environments.5
Connectivity relates not only to the transport network, but also
to the functional connectivity of the urban environment. We
analysed the availability of public transportation by calculating the

number of transportation stops in proximity to home and along

the school journey.


2.2.2.4. Variables related to comfort and attractiveness. The pre-

sence of open space or parks (Ding et al., 2011; Mitra, 2013) and

smaller neighbourhood blocks (Mitra, 2013) could enhance the

comfort of walking and cycling. The greenness of the environment

was analysed as the proportion of parks and recreation areas as

well as that of forests near home and along the route. The presence
of small neighbourhood blocks was operationalised as the pro-
portion of land covered by single family housing.
Sidewalks are nearly omnipresent in the Helsinki area and are,
probably for this reason, not included in any of the geographical
datasets available. In reality, there is little to be gained from ana-
lysing sidewalks in relation to mobility statistically, as there would
be no variance between subjects. Nevertheless, taking into con-
sideration the notion of comfort in respect of pedestrian and bi-
cycle mobility, we analysed the summed length of separate walk
or bikeways along the school journey divided by route length.

2.2.2.5. Variables related to maintaining social capital. As Mitra
(2013) notes, little research has been done on the connections
between the social environment and AST. Thus, in order to analyse
the possibility of meeting others on the school journey, we in-
cluded variables concerning population size and residential den-
sities near home and along the route of the school journey. In-
creasing population density has also been hypothesized as having
a positive association with transport-related physical activity
(Ding et al., 2011).
Moreover, accompaniment on the school journey SJ_WITH_-
FRIENDS (as described above) was used as an independent vari-
able operationalising the conceptual domain of maintaining social
capital.



2.2.2.6. Variables related to household and child. Household access
to private automobiles was interrogated by asking if the re-
spondent's family owned one, two or more cars, or no car at all
(OWN_CAR). Car-ownership was included in all the partially ad-

justed regressions.

Parents' general attitude towards their child's mobility options

can be seen in the mobility licences, i.e. permission to move
around independently granted to the child. Children granted a

greater level of independence were more likely walk or bike to
school in an Australian study (Merom et al., 2006). We oper-
ationalised the licences with a set of questions concerning those
things the child is allowed to do independently (Hillman et al.,
1990), revising some of the items to better re<U+FB02>ect the Finnish
context. The children answered whether they were allowed to do a
list of seven things alone (MOB_LICENCE_COUNT): go to leisure
activities, go to parks or sports facilities, use public transportation,
ride their bike, be outside after dark, go to the city centre or
shopping malls, and walk or ride to their friends' places.
Finally, age group and gender were included in all the models,
as they have been shown to be closely associated with both in-
dependence and the mode choice of children's travel (see e.g.
Mitra et al., 2014; Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Johansson et al., 2010).

2.3. Analysis

The environmental variables were extracted from register-
based geographical datasets using ESRI ArcMap 10.1 and MapInfo

Professional 11.5. The main geoprocessing techniques used were

buffering the homes and the school journeys, overlaying and in-

tersecting different layers of analysis with each other, and calcu-
lating statistics concerning the individual buffers from these in-

tersections as well as the building points within buffers. Different

raster calculation and focal statistical methods were used to cal-

culate variables concerning land use.

Three geographical datasets were used in the analysis. The land

use –related variables were calculated from the SLICES dataset6.

Population and building density-related variables were drawn
from a building centroid dataset7, and the Digiroad8 dataset was
used to build the traf<U+FB01>c-related variables.
The statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS Statis-
tics 21. The signi<U+FB01>cances in the differences of means between
genders and age groups were studied with T-tests and the differ-
ences of frequencies across groups with the chi-squared test. The
connections between the urban environment and the transport
mode were studied with multinomial regression analysis. Multi-
nomial outcomes were speci<U+FB01>ed in the models with a three ca-
tegory outcome of walking, cycling, or motorised travel (used as
the reference category).
A set of partially adjusted regressions (all adjusted for the
confounding effects of age, gender, household car-ownership, and
distance from home to school) were run to <U+FB01>lter the initial set of
variables down to those that showed correlation with the trans-
port mode choice on a con<U+FB01>dence level of 95% (p o0.05). Another
set of multivariate fully adjusted regressions were estimated se-
parately for the environment surrounding the home and school
journey. When variables showed strong correlations (r 40.75),
these were entered into the multivariate fully adjusted model one
at a time and only the variable that was most strongly associated

SLICES (Separated land use & cover information system) is a raster dataset
produced by the Finnish National Land Survey. The dataset combines geographical
datasets on land use from different organisations, such as the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Forestry, the Ministry of the Environment, the National Land Survey,
the Finnish Forest Research Institute, Finland's environmental administration and
the Population Register Centre. The dataset offers a hierarchical classi<U+FB01>cation of
land use, land cover, soil types and special use and restricted areas, and covers

Finland with a resolution of 10 m.

The building centroid dataset for each building in the Helsinki region, con-
taining the information on housing units, <U+FB02>oor areas and population demographics
for the building, was obtained from the city administration.

Digiroad is a national database which contains precise and accurate data on
the locations of all roads and streets in Finland, and their most important physical
features. The dataset also includes other transport system-related objects, such as

public transport stops or traf<U+FB01>c lights, stored as dynamically segmented events. The
Finnish Transport Agency maintains and updates the dataset.

3. Results

3.1. Partially adjusted models of transport mode choice on school
journeys

Table 2 presents the direction and signi<U+FB01>cance of associations
from the partially adjusted models for walking and cycling on the
school journey. Of the variables concerning traf<U+FB01>c and personal
safety, most were in signi<U+FB01>cant association with the transport
mode choice. Increasing street light densities as well as increasing
proportions of intersections with street lights decreased the
probability of choosing active transport modes rather than taking
the bus or being driven in a car. These associations were in con-
trast to the hypothesised increased feelings of safety and con-
sequential increase in walking or cycling. Targeting further the
issue of traf<U+FB01>c safety, the density of major roads on the school
journey was signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with walking and cycling: the

increasing density decreased the propensity of AST. The variables
used to study personal safety were partly in expected association
and partly in unexpected association with the transport mode.
Increasing building densities in the school journey and home en-
vironment decreased the propensity to walk or cycle. The higher
the prevalence of public buildings in the home environment, the
less likely the respondent was to walk and cycle. The increasing
mix in building uses in both the home and school journey en-
vironment decreased the probability of choosing one of the active
transport modes.
The variables related to connectivity showed signi<U+FB01>cant asso-
ciation with transport mode choice in particular with road and
intersection densities along the school journey route. Moreover,
the proportion of four-way intersections, as a percentage of all
intersections, was in signi<U+FB01>cant inverse association with activity
on the school journey. Each of these associations supports the
view that a denser environment decreases the probability that an
active mode will be chosen. Not surprisingly, the density of public
transport options around the home and school journey decreased
the probability of walking or cycling.
Comfort and attractiveness were studied with a set of variables
concerning land uses in the home and school journey environment

and the availability of separate walk or bikeways. The proportion
of forests in the environment was not associated with the trans-
port mode choice, but the more recreation areas there were
around the home or school journey, the less likely the respondents

were to walk or cycle. This <U+FB01>nding contrasts with the supposed
association. The increasing proportion of land covered by single-
family housing increased the likelihood of walking and cycling to
school signi<U+FB01>cantly, as was hypothesised. Then again, the avail-

ability of separate routes for walking and cycling was not asso-


ciated with choosing these modes of transport.
Finally, concerning the conceptual domain of maintaining so-
cial capital, the urban environmental variables showed signi<U+FB01>cant
associations with the choice of cycling to school. Increasing po-

pulation and housing densities in both the school journey and

home environments decreased the likelihood of cycling. The as-
sociations with walking were weaker, but still signi<U+FB01>cant at
po 0.05 level. Making the school journey in the company of

friends was not associated with the mode choice.

In general, all the associations studied, apart from the propor-
tion of single family housing around the home environment,

showed a similar tendency: the denser the measured variable, the

less likely the respondent was to walk or cycle. This has to do with
the respondents choosing between active transport modes and
using public transportation rather than being driven in a car.

In addition, the associations between the variables describing


the school journey environment had more signi<U+FB01>cant associations
with the mode choice than with the same variables describing the

home environment. We suggest that this is so because the school

journey environment depicts rather closely the environment that
might have some effect on the mode choice, whereas the en-
vironment surrounding the respondent's home potentially gives

too generalised a de<U+FB01>nition of the environment to matter.


3.2. Fully adjusted models for the home and school journey

environment


After investigating the initial associations between the vari-
ables selected to depict the conceptual domains of Mitra's model,
we ran fully adjusted models separately for the home and school
journey environments. These are presented in Table 3.
In the <U+FB01>nal model concerning the home environment, sig-


ni<U+FB01>cant associations persisted for the domains of proximity and
at      personal safety. The longer the distance between home and school,
the less likely children and young people were to walk or cycle to

signi<U+FB01>cant in the <U+FB01>nal model in spite of the large number of po-
tential variables related to the urban environment. Increasing

connectivity-related variables. Longer distances between home

and school decreased the likelihood of choosing active transport

modes. The effect of growing distance does not seem very sig-

ni<U+FB01>cant based on the odds ratios, but it must be noted that only

the respondents with distances from one to three kilometres were

included, and thus an increase of one unit (km) cannot produce

very large odds ratios.

As expected, the greater the incidence of major roads near the

route, the less likely the respondents were to cycle to school. The

association with walking to school here was not however sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant. Intersection density was signi<U+FB01>cant for the model in
general, but could not differentiate between the active transport
modes. The odds ratio for the variable concerning the density of
public transportation stops along the school journey was 0.659 in
relation to cycling, which implies that for each unit increase in the
number of bus stops per kilometre of the route, the odds that
cycling was the mode chosen decreased by 34%.
Gender and age group were associated with cycling. The
younger age group was 12 times more likely to cycle to school
compared to the older one, and boys more likely to cycle than girls.
Also car-ownership in respect of the household was signi<U+FB01>cantly
associated with the transport mode. Interestingly, the more cars
there were in the family, the more likely the respondents were to
cycle or walk to school.
The fully adjusted model for the school journey environment
predicted the transport mode choice correctly in 72% of cases. It
succeeded particularly well in predicting cycling and non-active
travel behaviour, whereas walking was less likely to be predicted
correctly. The fully adjusted model for the home environment was
less successful in making the correct predictions (62%), but not-
withstanding this, the model's prediction rate was better than the
proportional by chance accuracy rate of 35%, speci<U+FB01>ed for the data
at hand.

In Fig. 2, the environmental variables signi<U+FB01>cant in the fully
adjusted models are depicted on a series of maps. The <U+FB01>rst map

shows the transport modes and the actual school journeys drawn
by the respondents as well as the building densities in their home
environments. The three remaining maps depict the urban char-
acteristics of the school journey environment that were associated
with walking and cycling. The lowest rates of walking and cycling


to school can be seen in Helsinki city centre and the surrounding
urban core areas (the south-eastern part of the region) as well as
in the area where the main north-bound motorway and the ring
road meet (central north area on the map). These areas and the
pattern between transportation modes and the environmental
variables is clearly visible on the map depicting the major road
densities around school journeys, but also the other maps illus-


trate similar patterning.


4. Discussion and conclusions
g-
In this article, we studied the ways in which the surrounding
environment could impact or promote different types of physical
activity on school journeys, using the conceptual model proposed
by Mitra (2013). Of the domains proposed in the model, proximity,
connectivity and traf<U+FB01>c safety seemed to be the most relevant in
the Finnish context. The associations were more signi<U+FB01>cant when
the environment of the school journey was studied than in the
case of the home environment. Interestingly, many of the asso-

ciations present in the partially adjusted models were in contrast

to what had been suggested in the context of previous research.

As such, the question thus arises, can the results presented in

this article be compared to those generated previously, particularly

when we have dropped those subjects living closest to school and

those using predominantly active modes from our analysis. While

not presented in this article, we also ran the partially adjusted

multinomial regressions for all the respondents living within 3 km

of their school. These analyses showed no change in the directions

of the associations but substantially fewer signi<U+FB01>cant associations.

This is understandable, for within 1 km of the school, nearly all the

subjects walked or cycled, and hence we would not expect to <U+FB01>nd

an association between the different environmental factors based

on those few who had opted for inactive modes.

In their review, Ding et al. (2011) found residential density and
land-use mix to be consistently associated with transport physical
activity among both children and young people. Our <U+FB01>ndings
however contrasted somewhat with this general conclusion:
where increasing residential density and building use mix de-
creased the likelihood of engaging in AST. Subsequent to the car-
rying out of our own research, others have found a greater land
use mix to be negatively associated with children's walking to
school. Su et al., (2013) suggest this might be due to the diverse
landscape resulting in more people on the streets and a more
disorganised built environment. It is, moreover, possible that the
uses selected for the analysis are simply not relevant in respect of
children's mobility; and that rather than looking at residential,
commercial, of<U+FB01>ce and institutional land uses, an even mix of
which has been shown to promote activity in the adult population,
we should instead examine other types of land use. This is further
emphasised through the notion that dense built environments,
often associated with commercial, institutional and of<U+FB01>ce land
uses, decreased the likelihood of walking and cycling in this study.
All the partially adjusted models with signi<U+FB01>cant associations
to the transport mode showed associations in the same direction,
the increase in the variables decreasing the likelihood of walking
or cycling being chosen. The only exception was the proportion of
single family housing. We reason that actually all of the physical
environmental variables used measure at some level the same

Generalising the environment affecting people's mobility and
transportation choices into buffers surrounding the home may not
however be a suitable way to grasp the elements of the environ-
ment meaningful for an individual. Indeed, most children were
found to use only 25% of the area buffered along the road network
within 800 and 1600 m of their home (Villanueva et al., 2012), or
only a narrow section of the circular buffer around their home (Yin
et al., 2013). Rather than using assumed neighbourhoods then,
future research should instead concentrate on the actual en-
vironments the respondents use, and explore the associations of
these environments with mobility behaviours.
The domain of maintaining social capital was somewhat awk-
wardly operationalised as the population density near the home
and en route to school, due to the limited nature of the data
available on the social attributes of the environment. It should
however be questioned whether population density is a good re-
presentation of the ability to maintain social capital, as the re-
lationships involved here could be diverse and not linear. Never-
theless, previous research in Finland has shown that population
density around children's meaningful places increases both the
odds for active transport to be used while also stating a positive
emotional assessment of the place (Broberg et al., 2013), perhaps
supporting the use of population density. Concentrating more on
the actual environments where this mobility is enacted, be it on

school journeys or to other meaningful places, might also help to
tackle this problematic domain. Panter et al., (2008) have also
discussed how possible motivational elements on the school

journey, such as a friend's house or shops to visit en route or parks

to play in, might in<U+FB02>uence the travel mode. Indeed, empirical
evidence from a small study using mobile phones and GPS devices

to understand children's perceptions of their school journey

(Pooley et al., 2010) supports this view of the importance of the
child's own motivation to move in the environment, as it was
found that pupils who travelled independently were most likely to

engage with their immediate environment.
Methodologically we tried to tackle head on the challenges
posed by AST research outlined by Wong et al. (2011). Such issues

here include the need for accuracy when geocoding the subject's
home location and estimating the school journey route based on
road network data. We have tried to overcome these problems by

letting the subjects pinpoint their home and draw the route taken.
The accuracy of the geographical data produced by children and
young people can of course be questioned, but generally there

have been no real problems in geographical accuracy in our da-

tasets concerning children, possibly due to orienteering being part
of the school curriculum. The mapping application also helped

children to orientate on the map by automatically panning the

map to the school selected from a drop-down list. In addition,
Wong et al. (2011) raise the issue of inconsistency in applying the
measures of the built environment, which we have tried to mini-

mise by using the measures developed in previous research. Si-
milarly, we also identi<U+FB01>ed the problem of overlapping buffers
creating high correlation in the built environment data between

subjects. By only including the subjects with school journeys in a
certain range, the data became signi<U+FB01>cantly more dispersed. Fi-
nally, again as suggested by them, we have used as spatially dis-

aggregated data as possible, which in the Finnish setting is quite
easy, as there are spatial datasets concerning for example each
building instead of statistical unit aggregates.

It might be argued that the two age groups included should

have been studied separately, as it is hypothesised that the travel
behaviours of children and young people are different (Mitra,
2013). However, as Finnish children are notably independent in

mobility terms from their early years, we found it reasonable to
analyse the age groups jointly. Nevertheless, in future research

including wider groups of children, the potential impact of age
differences should be taken into account.
