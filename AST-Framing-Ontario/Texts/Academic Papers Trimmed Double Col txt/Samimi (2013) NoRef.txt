Case Study
Students’ Tendency to Walk to School:
Case Study of Tehran
Amir Samimi 1 and Alireza Ermagun 2
Abstract: The recent decrease in physical activity among youth, which has resulted in increasing obesity and in overweight individuals,
has attracted global attention and a renewed sense of investigation in both public and academic circles. However, using active modes of

transportation (AMT) to and from school can serve as a bulwark against inactivity and the increase in cases of obesity and excess weight. In an
attempt to study and counteract this growing phenomenon, more than 4,700 questionnaires were distributed in 92 schools throughout Tehran
in a random stratified sampling method according to location and gender differences, and 3,441 responses were received (72% response rate).
Significant factors affecting each gender’s propensity to choose active modes of transportation to and from school were separated and
identified. Among females, 45% chose an AMT to school, and 52% did so for return trips home, both of which are higher than the males’
propensity to choose AMT. Among males, 39% chose an AMT to school, and 46% did so for the way back. Female tolerance in active modes
of transportation also proved to be greater than that of males such that with an increase in costly factors (e.g., increases in travel time),
economic considerations (e.g., household car ownership), and tougher topography, females substituted away from AMT less than males.
