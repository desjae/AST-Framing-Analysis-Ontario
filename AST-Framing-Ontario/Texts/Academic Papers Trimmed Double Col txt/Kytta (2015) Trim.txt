from the 16 countries involved in the large international comparative study for which the current

understanding of and explanation to these trends.

generally. These datasets offer few possibilities to distinguish the
sociocultural, family, or child-related factors that can motivate
increasing mobility restrictions.
The current study reported in this paper contributes to these
sparse foundations by replicating the original CIM survey by
Hillman et al. (1990) in Finland. CIM was operationalized on two
levels: as a set of mobility ‘‘licenses’’ parents give to their children
and as the actual mobility patterns of children. A license simulta-
neously ‘‘re<U+FB02>ect[s] parental judgments about the degree of matu-
rity and competence required by their children to cope safely
with the perceived dangers that lie outside the home’’ (Hillman
et al., 1990) and the actual permissions children are granted to
conduct particular activities. Even if children enjoy mobility
licenses, they do not always use possibilities to move around inde-
pendently. Therefore it is essential to also study the actual mobility
and not only to school but to other places of interest where
children want to travel independently and actively. In this study,
data about licenses and actual mobility were requested from both
parents and children themselves. This approach allowed the anal-
ysis of children’s mobility patterns beyond home-school travelling
and provided some indicators of children’s experiences and
household attitudes as well.
The study reported here is a part of a large international com-
parative study that was carried out in 16 countries (Shaw et al.,
2015). While the majority of the participating countries cannot
compare the current level of CIM with the levels of independent
mobility experienced by children decades earlier, this comparison
is possible for Finland. In the earlier half of the 1990s, similar data
were gathered in Finland using the same questionnaire developed
by Hillman et al. (1990). Findings of this study by Kyttä (1997,
2004) suggested that the independent mobility of Finnish children
was clearly higher than that of British and German (Hillman et al.,
1990; Hillman and Adams, 1992) and Australian children (Tranter
and Whitelegg, 1994).
The <U+FB01>rst part of the current study reports the degree of indepen-
dent mobility of Finnish children in 2011. We studied the indepen-
dent mobility of primary and secondary school children aged
between 7 and 15 years. Our analysis concentrated on comparing
<U+FB01>ve different settlements in terms of CIM and the associations
between mobility licenses and actual mobility. In the second part
of the study, the current situation was compared with earlier <U+FB01>nd-
ings from the 1990s, with a particular focus on 8- to 10-year-old
pupils.


2. Background

The past decade has produced a vast evidence base identifying
various factors that can promote or hinder children’s independent
and active lifestyles. The independent and active mobility of chil-
dren is an outcome of a very complex set of developmental
(Ahmadi, 2007; Burgmanis et al., 2014; Rissotto and Tonucci,
2002), familial (Barron, 2014; Jensen et al., 2014), sociocultural
(Depeau, 2001; Malone and Rudner, 2011; Valentine, 2004), and
environmental characteristics (Alparone and Pacilli, 2012; Mitra
and Buliung, 2014; Villanueva et al., 2013), as well as the policy
context (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Rudner, 2012). Individual and
family characteristics that are affecting CIM include children’s
age, maturity and gender (Johansson, 2006), family structure,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity (Loebach and Gilliland, 2014;
Weir et al., 2006), gender of parent, and parent employment
(Valentine, 2004; Witten et al., 2013). This includes matters
regarding weight of school bags, convenience, families spending
time together, and trip chaining (Johansson, 2006; O’Connor and
Brown, 2013; Witten et al., 2013). Environmental factors such as
weather, urban form, pathways, connectivity, presence of green
of Transport Geography 47 (2015) 1–12
spaces, and distance to school and other destinations also affect
CIM (Broberg et al., 2013a,b; Giles-Corti et al., 2011; McMillan,
2005; Rothman et al., 2014), as do mode of transport, traf<U+FB01>c speeds,
and volumes (Carver et al., 2008; Drianda and Kinoshita, 2011;
Woldeamanuel, 2014). Increasingly, the role of social trust and
conceptions of risk have been identi<U+FB01>ed as signi<U+FB01>cant in<U+FB02>uences
on decision making about children’s freedom to go places on their
own (Jackson and Scott, 1999; Madge and Barker, 2007; Rudner,
2012; Tomanovic´ and Petrovic´, 2010).
If children have low independent mobility, their active travel
tends to decrease and hence can diminish their overall physical
activity. Organized activities can rarely compensate for the sponta-
neous everyday outdoor activities and independent mobility to
school, errands, and hobbies (Mackett and Paskins, 2008).
The physical health consequences on children’s inactive lifestyle,
the growing risk of overweight and obesity, and the resulting
health problems like type II diabetes has therefore raised research-
ers’ attention (Casey et al., 2014; Datar et al., 2013; Saelens et al.,
2012; Wolch et al., 2011). In Finland, these concerns are relevant
because the proportion of overweight 12- to 18-year-old children
almost tripled between 1977 and 2003, which now comprises
about 20% of adolescents (Kautiainen et al., 2002, 2009).
Other individual detrimental effects associated with low CIM
include cognitive, emotional, and social developmental impacts.
There are impacts on the processes of building environmental
knowledge and consciousness (Palmberg and Kuru, 2000;
Burgmanis et al., 2014) and personal emotional bonds with the
environment (Bixler et al., 2002; Kong, 2000). Decreasing CIM
has also been associated with dif<U+FB01>culties in socializing with peers
(Hüttenmoser, 1995; Prezza et al., 2001), and this can lead to
impacts on social and personality development (Kantomaa, 2010).
The decrease in CIM can also be accompanied by larger-scale
societal impacts like everyday life practices of families who use
increasing time for chauffeuring (Kyttä, 2008; Fyhri et al., 2011),
which compromises the sustainability of public transport systems.
These impacts can vary within and between different settlement
types. For example, families in rural areas may experience longer
travelling distances, fewer and less frequent transport options,
and lack of local schools compared with inner urban areas
(Carver et al., 2013; McDonald et al., 2011). Since the factors
affecting mobility and impacts of loss of mobility can vary geo-
graphically, it is important that research includes different settle-
ment areas. This will facilitate more sensitive policy development.
Focusing on school travel as an indicator, Finland, along with
Norway and Japan (Drianda and Kinoshita, 2011), has recently
been identi<U+FB01>ed as having a higher level of CIM compared with
many countries. Carver et al. (2013) found that 26% of English
and 33% of Australian children travelled to and/or from school on
their own, whereas according to Shaw et al. (2013), 67% of
German children travelled without adult accompaniment. Less
than 30% of children travel alone as reported in a Canadian study
(Loebach and Gilliland, 2014), and 26% in a study from the USA
(Surface Transport Policy Project, Transportation and Land Use
Coalition and Latino Issues Forum, 2003). Portugal and Iran suggest
even lower rates of CIM at 15% (Lopes et al., 2014) and 8%
(Shokoohi et al., 2011), respectively. In many African nations, levels
of CIM are more starkly re<U+FB02>ective of income, with children from
poorer backgrounds experiencing much higher levels of CIM than
those from richer backgrounds, with wealthier children experienc-
ing less independent mobility (Behrens and Muchaka, 2011;
Larouche et al., 2014).
Most studies primarily focus on inner urban and suburban
neighborhoods, which do not re<U+FB02>ect the diversity of settlement
patterns in which children live, the number of variations of
activities they can access within their local area, or their access
to multiple modes of transport. Furthermore, few studies reveal

M. Kyttä et al. / Journal
whether children’s or parents’ concerns differ across these settle-
ment types (Behrens and Muchaka, 2011; Kamargianni et al.,
2012). Fortunately, recent international research is providing
greater insight into rural children’s mobility patterns (Behrens
and Muchaka, 2011; Bwire, 2011; Carver et al., 2013; Drianda
and Kinoshita, 2011; Gutiérrez-Zornoza et al., 2014; Yatiman
et al., 2012). This paper contributes to this work by providing a
comparative study of CIM from the 1990s to the 2010s across <U+FB01>ve
different settlement types to identify whether similar situations
are occurring in Finland.


3. Methodology

3.1. Procedure, subjects, and the data collection in 2010s

The international comparative study on CIM, for which the
Finnish data was collected, was led by a research team at the
Policy Studies Institute (PSI) in London, Great Britain. According
to the instructions from PSI, <U+FB01>ve types of settlements were sur-
veyed to ensure various Finnish contexts were represented: inner
city, suburban setting, large town, small town and rural village.
Below we describe these settlements and the schools studied.The
inner city was an urban neighborhood, Töölö, in the central part
of the city of Helsinki, the capital of Finland, situated on the south-
ern coast of Finland. The population of Helsinki is about 600 000
and the population density 2826 inhabitants/km2. The data was
collected in the elementary and secondary schools of Töölö with
the total of about 430 and 300 pupils, respectively. Both Töölö
schools have special bilingual (English – Finnish) classes,
secondary school has also mathematics and Latin-oriented classes.
The suburban setting was the Kirkkonummi suburb located
30 km west from Helsinki’s center. Kirkkonummi is a municipality
with about 37 000 inhabitants and the population density is
103 inhabitants/km2. A large proportion of the population is work-
ing in Helsinki. The elementary school of Kirkkonummi is located
in the centre of Kirkkonummi and the number of students is
approximately 400. The secondary school with about 100 students
situates in a suburb of Masala about 8 km from the centre of
Kirkkonummi.
The large town, Hämeenlinna, is a medium-sized town (about
67 000 inhabitants, population density 38 inhabitants/km2), that
is situated 100 km north of Helsinki. The studied school in
Hämeenlinna consists of two units: The elementary school
Tuomela and the secondary school Hätilä. Both units are 5 min
walking distance from the centre of Hämeenlinna. The number of
students in total is approximately 550.
The small town Kitee, is located in Eastern Finland and has about
9 000 inhabitants with population density 9 inhabitants/km2. A
remarkable proportion of population live in sparsely populated
rural areas. The Arppe school that includes both elementary and
secondary schools is located in the centre of Kitee. The number
of students in total is approximately 550.
The rural villages are located in Kauhajoki, a town in Western
Finland. Kauhajoki has about 14 000 inhabitants and it is popula-
tion density is on average 11 inhabitants/km2. The villages Aro,
Päntäne and Hyyppä are very sparsely build rural villages with a
few hundred inhabitants. The elementary schools in these villages
have from 15 to 50 students per school. The secondary school of
Kauhajoki is situated in the centre of Kauhajoki and the number
of students is about 300.
From each of the <U+FB01>ve settlements, primary and secondary
schools were approached and permits from school boards and
heads of the schools were acquired. In the inner city and large

town, there were more than one primary and secondary school.
In these cases, we selected schools that best met the criteria of
of Transport Geography 47 (2015) 1–12                                                        3
selection for study areas. In all schools, surveys were delivered to
all pupils and their parents.
The data were collected in May 2011. It was important to time
the data collection equally in all settlements because of signi<U+FB01>cant
seasonal varieties in Finland. About 2500 questionnaires were
delivered to pupils in primary and secondary schools in the <U+FB01>ve
research areas. The exact number of delivered questionnaires is
not known because the schools/teachers always took some extra
copies to ensure that each child got a copy. The questionnaire con-
sisted of two parts: parents’ and children’s surveys. Both surveys
were sent home from school via the children. According to our
instructions, children and parents responded to their own surveys
independently. The parents returned both their and their children’s
completed questionnaires by mail in prepaid envelopes that were
provided.
In total, 821 primary and secondary schoolchildren1 aged
7–14 years from <U+FB01>ve settlements participated in the study. The over-
all response rate was 33% but cannot be known precisely because of
the unknown exact number of delivered surveys mentioned above.
The response rate varied in the different settings, with the lowest
response rate in the suburban setting (29%) and the highest response
rate in the small town setting (35%). In all cases, we received both
children’s and parents’ responses.

3.2. Procedure, subjects, and the data collection in the 1990s

In the follow-up study, a subsample of a dataset collected in the
2010s was compared with an earlier dataset collected by Kyttä
(1997) between 1993 and 1994 (later referred to as a dataset from
the 1990s). The subsample from the 2010s included second- and
third-grade pupils (8- to 10-year-olds) and consisted of 140 chil-
dren and 140 parents who were living in inner city, small town,
or rural settings. This dataset was compared with the earlier data
from the 1990s, where the inner city (Töölö, Helsinki) and small
town (Kitee) locations and schools were the same as those studied
in the 2010s. The rural villages originally studied in the 1990s,
Harjankylä and Luomankylä, were not the same villages as in the
later dataset because the schools in these villages had been closed.
Both sets of rural villages were, however, located in the same town
(Kauhajoki) in Western Finland and represented the same cultural
context. Some pupils also lived in the original villages, although
nowadays they are transported by taxis or buses to the neighbor-
ing villages that were among our new set of villages. The large
town and suburban settings were not studied in 1990s and there-
fore were not included in this comparison. Both datasets were col-
lected in May to ensure that seasonal variation does not in<U+FB02>uence
the <U+FB01>ndings comparing the two periods.
In the data collection of 1990s, all second or third grade stu-
dents (aged eight to ten) were recruited from the selected settle-
ment types to participate in the survey through the local primary
schools. Children answered the survey at school under the supervi-
sion of their teachers and took home an envelope with the parental
survey to be completed by their parents. The parents returned the
sealed envelopes containing the completed questionnaire to the
schoolteachers, who sent them to the researcher. A total of 165
children and 130 parents returned the survey. The response rate
for children was 79%, while that for parents was 75%.

3.3. Measures

In the two phases of the study, almost identical methods were
used. In the earlier study, the CIM survey by Hillman et al.

Finnish children begin school usually at the age of seven. The elementary school
has grades 1 to 6. When pupils are about 13 years, they start the secondary school,
which has grades 7–9. This dataset includes respondents from grades 1–8.

4                                              M. Kyttä et al. / Journal
(1990) was translated from English to Finnish, and some minor
changes were made to adjust the questions to the Finnish context.
An almost identical questionnaire was used in the international
comparative study organized by PSI. The new version of the survey
included a more detailed survey of weekend activities of children
and the reasons parents had for restricting children’s mobility.
The two research themes, mobility licenses and actual mobility,
were studied using the following measures:
Mobility licenses: Both parents and children were asked whether
the child was allowed to (1) cross main roads alone, (2) travel
home from school alone, and (3) travel on buses alone. Parents
were also queried whether the child was allowed to (4) go on their
own to places other than school or to (5) go out alone after dark.
Children were asked if they may (6) cycle on main roads alone.
All these mobility license questions were answered using a
dichotomous scale (0 = no, 1 = yes).
A mobility license score (value range 0–6) was computed by
summing the aforementioned six items using a procedure applied
in the original study by Hillman et al. (1990). Three of these items
were from children’s survey, namely, licenses to cross roads, cycle
on roads, and use buses alone. The items from the parents’ survey
included coming home from school, going to places other than
school, and going out after dark. Missing values were imputed with
value 0 in cases where there were responses for at least four items.
This happened in 3% of the cases.
Parents were queried about the possible reasons for restricting
the mobility of their child. Unfortunately, the listed reasons in the
original survey differed from those in the later one. Therefore, the
reasons are only reported in relation to the <U+FB01>ndings of the data
from the 2010s.
Actual mobility: Three measures were used to study the degree
of actual independent mobility. First, children were asked about
their independent mobility to and from school on the day they
were surveyed. Dichotomous variables were created based on
answers in the following way: 1 = travelled without adults/older
children during both journeys (options: ‘‘travelled on my own’’
or ‘‘child of same age or younger’’) and 0 = travelled with adult-
s/older children (options: ‘‘parent,’’ ‘‘another adult,’’ or ‘‘older
child/teenager’’).
Second, children were asked about their school travel mode. A
dichotomous variable was constructed that measured the activity
of the school travel mode. Score 1 represented active travel modes
(options: ‘‘walked most of or all the way’’ and ‘‘cycled’’) if the child
had travelled actively both to and from school. Score 0 represented
all inactive options (‘‘school bus,’’ ‘‘local bus or train or
underground,’’ and ‘‘car’’) and the cases if the child went one
way actively.
Weekend activities: The third measure was related to the num-
ber of independent weekend activities. The questionnaire in the
2010s included 12 options for weekend activities. Children were
asked if they independently (1) visited a friend’s home; (2) went
for a walk or cycled around; (3) played sports or went swimming;
(4) went to listen music; (5) went to a playground, park, or playing
<U+FB01>eld; (6) went to hobbies/youth clubs; (7) went shopping; (8)
spent time outside with a friend after dark; (9) visited relatives
or grown-ups; (10) went to a library; (11) went to a cinema; or
(12) visited a place of worship. In addition, children could name
up to three other activities. While the original survey in the
1990s included 16 different activities, only 6 of them were
identical with the activities used in the 2010s. These activities
were numbers 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 11 listed above. Dichotomous vari-
ables were created based on this information that indicated
whether a child had engaged in at least one independent activity
on the weekend. In the follow-up study, a shorter list of six activ-
ities was used as a basis for the creation of this dichotomous
variable.
of Transport Geography 47 (2015) 1–12
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
version 21. Independent t-tests were used to test the differences
between means of mobility licenses. Chi-square tests were con-
ducted to test the signi<U+FB01>cance of the differences in the degree of
independent mobility to school and weekend activities. Finally,
logistic regression analysis was used to study the associations
between mobility licenses on one hand and actual independent
and active mobility on the other. In these analyses, gender and
car ownership were controlled because they had signi<U+FB01>cant

4.1. The samples in the 2010s and 1990s

To study CIM in Finland in the 2010s, a sample of 7- to
14-year-old children and their parents were studied in <U+FB01>ve differ-
ent settings in 2011. The <U+FB01>rst part of this results section reports
these <U+FB01>ndings. In the second part, a subsample of 8- to
10-year-old children were analyzed. These children in three differ-
ent settings had been studied both in 1993–94 and in 2011. Thus,
we were able to do the follow-up for CIM in the 1990s and 2010s.
The <U+FB01>rst sample comprised 641 primary school (46% boys, 54%
girls) and 180 secondary school (43% boys, 57% girls) children and
their parents, which provided a total of 821 children. The share of
inner city children was 20% (165 children), suburban was 18% (150
children), large town was 22% (180 children), small town was 23%
(187 children), and rural children was 17% (139 children). The
mean ages of the primary and secondary school children were
10.1 (SD 1.8, range = 6) and 13.9 (SD 0.7, range = 2), respectively.
Parents’ questionnaires were completed mainly by mothers
(87%). Of the parents who replied, 81% had full-time work, 84% of
families owned their home, and 94% had one or more cars. There
were no signi<U+FB01>cant differences in the mean ages of children living
in various types of settlements. Some background variables of the
respondent families varied among the settlements. The degree of
car ownership was lowest in the inner city settlement (X2 = 59.7,
df = 4, p = .000), where the share of families without a car was
19% while it was in suburban setting 5%; large town, 4%; small
town, 2%; and rural village, 1%. The share of families living in
rented homes was also the highest (X2 = 59.7, df = 12, p = .000) in
the inner city. The percentage of families living in rented homes
in the inner city was 26%; suburban, 16%; large town, 10%; small
town, 17%; and rural village, 4%. The proportion of families where
neither of the parents was in paid work did not differ signi<U+FB01>cantly
among the <U+FB01>ve settlements but varied between 4% (small town)
and 10% (large town).
The second sample consisted of a total of 305 8- to 10-year-old
children and their parents who participated the CIM study in the
1990s (165 children or 54%) or in the 2010s (140 children or
46%). Only three different settlements (inner city, small town,
and rural village) were studied because the earlier sample included
only these settlement types. In the earlier sample, the proportion
of inner city (44%) and small town (44%) children were higher than
in the later sample (34% and 40%, respectively), while the propor-
tion of rural village children was lower in the earlier sample (12%)
compared with the later one (26%), these differences being signif-
icant (X2 = 9.8, df = 2, p = .008). The mean age of the children was
8.9 years (SD 0.7), which did not differ signi<U+FB01>cantly in the 1990s
and 2010s. In both datasets, 53% of respondents were boys, and
the parents <U+FB01>lling the survey were predominantly female (83%).
In the earlier sample, the share of families without cars was higher
(16% in 1990s versus 7% in 2010s, X2 = 25.4, df = 2, p = .000), and
more families lived in rented homes (34% in 1990s versus 20% in
2010s, X2 = 6.4, df = 1, p = .01). During a span 20 years, these differ-
ences had become less sharp among the three types of settlements:

M. Kyttä et al. /
The share of families without a car had changed in the inner city
from 32% to 19% and in the small town from 7% to 2%; and in the
rural village had stayed at 0%. The proportion of families living in
rented homes had changed in inner city from 60% to 28%, in the

small town from 24% to 23%, and in rural village from 0% to 6%.

4.2.1. Mobility licenses
The mean scores of mobility licenses of the primary and sec-
ondary school children in various settlements are presented in
Table 1. The mobility licenses of primary school children living in

suburban and large town settings were signi<U+FB01>cantly higher
(F = 12.6, df = 4, p = 0.001) than those of inner city, small town,

and rural children. These differences between settlements were

not signi<U+FB01>cant in the secondary school level.
The only signi<U+FB01>cant difference (t = 2.34, df = 153, p = .021)
between the mobility licenses of boys and girls was related to the
fewer licenses granted to small town primary girls (mean 3.7)
compared with those granted to boys (mean 4.3). Secondary school
children generally enjoyed more mobility licenses than children
attending primary school (meansec = 5.59, meanpri = 4.11, t = 11.73,
df = 816, p = .000). This difference applied to all settlements.
The only background variable that was signi<U+FB01>cantly related to
the degree of mobility licenses was the work status of the parents.
The mobility licenses of children whose parents were not in paid
work were lower (mean = 3.6) than those of children in families
where at least one of the parents was in paid work (mean = 4.1).
This difference was signi<U+FB01>cant only in the primary school level
(t = 2.03, df = 637, p = .042).
A closer look at the various mobility licenses revealed that the
clearly superior mobility licenses of children living in suburban
and large town settings hold true only in the license to cross roads
and to go to leisure activities. Inner city children had especially low
licenses to come home from school and cycle on roads, while they
enjoyed most freedom to use buses (see Fig. 1).

4.2.2. Actual mobility
As shown in Table 2, primary children living in the large town
travelled independently both to and from school more often com-
pared with children living in other settlements. The differences
among the settlements were signi<U+FB01>cant only among primary
school children (X2 = 19.8, df = 4, p = .001). In all settlements, the
general level of independency was very high, and the proportion
of children travelling both to and from school independently varied
from 64% to 86% in primary school and from 79% to 91% in sec-
ondary school. There were no signi<U+FB01>cant gender differences, but
secondary school children went to school independently more
often than primary school children (84% and 72%, respectively,
X2 = 11.35, df = 1, p = .001).

Fig. 1. The various mobility licenses of children living in the <U+FB01>ve settlements in
Finland in the 2010s. The information concerning the dimensions marked with à
were obtained from children, while the other dimensions of license holding were
reported by parents (/p < 0.05, //p < 0.01, ///p < 0.001).

Also, the activity of children’s school travel mode was signi<U+FB01>-
cantly higher in large town compared to the other settlements,
among both primary (X2 = 66.3, df = 4, p = .000) and secondary
(X2 = 26.5, df = 4, p = .000) school children. The differences among
the settlements were rather clear: while 88% of large town children
travelled both journeys to and from school actively, the proportion
for rural village children was only 47%. In inner city setting, walk-
ing was the most common mode of travel (60% to school, 56% from
school). Cycling was most prevalent in large town (54% to school,
54% from school). Travelling by school bus, taxi or public trans-
portation was most common in rural village (35% to school, 36%
from school) and almost nonexistent in large town (2% to school,
2% from school). Travelling with a private car took place most often
in suburban (17% to school, 14% from school) and rural village (14%
to school, 13% from school) settings. Primary school girls were
more active in their school travel than boys: 65% of girls and 54%
of boys travelled both journeys actively (X2 = 8.0, df = 1, p = .005).
This gender difference did not apply to the secondary schoolers.
Children were picked up from school by parents 0.9 day a week
on average. Pickup occurred most often in rural village and least
often in large town. The differences among settlements were sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant (X2 = 6.5, df = 4, p = .001). The most common reasons
reported by parents were that they combined the pickup with
another activity (32%) or they had concerns about traf<U+FB01>c danger
(32%). Various settlements differed here often signi<U+FB01>cantly (see
Fig. 2). For example, inner city parents had more concerns about
traf<U+FB01>c danger and indicated they enjoyed the opportunity to spend
time with their children in the car, whereas small town parents
were more prone to combine trips. Children were somewhat more

settlements in Finland in the 2010s.

When it comes to the independence of weekend activities, most

of the children did at least one independent activity during the pre-
vious weekend. The percentages of children having at least one
independent weekend activity varied from 74% (inner city primary

children) to 100% (large town secondary children) (Table 2).
Generally, secondary school children performed independent

weekend activities more often than primary schoolers (95% and
86%, respectively, X2 = 10.42, df = 1, p = .001). Boys and girls did
not differ in this respect signi<U+FB01>cantly. The differences among vari-

ous settlements in the independence of weekend activities were
signi<U+FB01>cant in the primary school level (X2 = 20.6, df = 4, p = .001),
not in the secondary school level. Children living in suburban set-
ting enjoyed independent weekend activities most often, whereas
inner city children enjoyed them least often.

The only signi<U+FB01>cant background variable that was related to the

degree of actual mobility patterns of children was family’s access

to a car. Children whose family had access to a car did travel to

school actively less often (59%) than children whose families did
not have access to a car (83%). This difference was only signi<U+FB01>cant
(X2 = 9.4, df = 1, p = .002) among primary school children.

to cultural norms, and individual approaches to risk management
(Rudner, 2012), as well as a response to changing environmental
conditions. In secondary school, the associations between mobility
licenses and actual mobility disappeared. This is understandable
because as children become more independent decision makers,
parental perceptions or permissions become less meaningful in
their mobility choices. The <U+FB01>ndings above can, nevertheless, also
be due to too small variation in the key variables. A ceiling effect
(Cramer and Howitt, 2004) occurs, when scores are approaching
the maximum they can be. In our case, the mobility license score
in 2010s and the actual mobility measures in 1990s were
approaching their maximums.
Combining pickup with other errands and concerns about traf<U+FB01>c
danger were the most important reasons for collecting children
from school, although Finnish children were rarely picked up by
parents. Johansson (2006) and Fyhri et al. (2011) have noticed
the growing importance of trip chaining as a relevant factor behind
the changing mobility patterns of families. While trip chaining may
be viewed as a necessity in other contexts (Mitra, 2012; Freeman
and Quigg, 2009; McMillan, 2005), this is not necessarily the cur-
rent situation for Finland because school travel is dominated by
active and public transportation; moreover, the majority of chil-
dren have independent weekend activities. This may change in
the future as society responds and adapts to recent policies of cen-
tralization of services and closure of local schools, and potentially
increases its reliance on centralized shopping and recreation facil-
ities (Freeman and Quigg, 2009). However, trip chaining may also
be re<U+FB02>ective of geographical location, socioeconomic status, and
attitudes (McMillan, 2005). These possible changes in the lifestyles
of families would deserve closer scrutiny.
We found only a few gender differences in the independent
mobility of Finnish children. In the dataset from 2010s, small town
primary school girls held fewer mobility licenses than boys their
own age. Boys’ higher degree of mobility licenses have been indi-
cated in many earlier studies (Carver et al., 2012; Fyhri and
Hjorthol, 2009; Johansson, 2006; O’Brien et al., 2000). In our study,
these differences were small and had little in<U+FB02>uence on children’s
actual mobility. On the contrary, primary girls were more active in
school travel than boys, which is in contrast to an earlier study by
McDonald (2012). Not surprisingly, secondary school children
enjoyed more mobility licenses and were more independent in
their school travel and weekend activities.
The limitations of this study are related especially to the miss-
ing data about the distance to school and the low response rate in
the 2010s dataset. Also the fact that all the studied settings were
not quite identical in the two data collection phases was an unfor-
tunate matter that potentially in<U+FB02>uenced the <U+FB01>ndings. The actual
distance to school should have been asked from parents instead
of asking how long time the journey would take using various tra-
vel modes. The low response rate applied to the dataset of 2010s. It
was probably partly due to the data collection strategy where all
surveys were delivered in schools but <U+FB01>lled at homes and sent
directly to researchers. In 1990s, when the response rate was
higher, children <U+FB01>lled the surveys in school and returned the par-
ental surveys to teachers. The new strategy was used to save
resources. Also the fact that in 2010s both primary and secondary
schools were studied instead of only primary schools may have
contributed to the lower response rate in the 2010s. Overall, the
big differences in the response rates between the datasets from
1990s and 2010s can include a risk that non-responders would

score even lower CIM than the participants of the survey. Then

the perceived declined trend in children’s independent mobility
would in reality be even more clear.
The reliability of the kind of self-reported data collected here is

never without problems, and in future studies, objective mobility
data should also be collected. Again, it is not enough to follow only
of Transport Geography 47 (2015) 1–12
the changing mobility licenses as these at best only represent
potential independent mobility. It is even more important to invest
in the development of more advanced methods for the study of
actual mobility. In addition to self-reported surveys, other meth-
ods, such as mobility diaries, GPS tracking, and public participation
GIS tools (Kyttä et al., 2012), could provide a more place-based,
more reliable, and richer understanding of the actual mobility pat-
terns of children.

6. Conclusions

Safeguarding the independence of children has attracted little
public debate in Finland (Aarnikko et al., 2002; Turpeinen et al.,
2013). Instead, children’s independence and free mobility have
been criticized; they have been associated with a lack of parental
care and children’s loneliness; hence, more adult supervision for
children’s free time has been suggested (Pulkkinen and Launonen,
2005). This is disconcerting because decreasing levels of CIM and
fewer children on the streets can increase or reinforce the need
for surveillance (Rudner, 2012), and potentially levels of concern
about children’s safety similar to the UK, USA, and Australia.
Our view is that a high degree of CIM is an elementary part of
Finnish childhood and child development. It is possible that when
children are trusted enough to allow them independence in their
mobility, it also helps them build competencies needed in other
spheres of life. Stopping the decline of CIM and safeguarding the
current level of independent mobility of Finnish children should
be a common concern of a variety of stakeholders, including the
social, health, school, cultural, youth work, recreation, real estate,
and environmental sectors.
The most urgent concrete measure would be to provide children
with the possibility to attend school close to home. A program for
assessing urban, social, and health policy development should also
be implemented at local, regional, and national levels to identify
the potential positive and adverse impacts on CIM in different set-
tlement types. Actions like school closures disproportionately
affect rural children more than their urban counterparts, and the
centralization of facilities such as shopping and recreation can lead
to socioeconomic inequality across all settlement areas, which can
be compounded by other factors such as changes to transport
routes and frequency of services. Finland has an opportunity to
slow down, stop, or even reverse the decline of CIM before it drops
to the levels experienced by children in other nations.
