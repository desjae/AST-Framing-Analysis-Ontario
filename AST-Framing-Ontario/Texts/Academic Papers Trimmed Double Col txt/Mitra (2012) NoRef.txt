11–12 years, in the City of Toronto, Canada, were estimated, using six spatial units for measuring built
environment characteristics. The results were suggestive of the presence of MAUP across different geo-
graphical units. Travel distance, block density, signalized intersections, walking density, and schools in
low-income neighborhoods were associated with active travel. This research improves understanding
of the sensitivity of school travel behavior analyses to the spatial representation of the neighborhood

the context of school travel behavior research, a scale effect may be
present when analytical results exhibit sensitivity to the size of
spatial units used for built environment measurement. For exam-
ple, the use of a relatively small spatial unit, such as a 250 m buffer
around a residential or school location, may produce unreliable
statistical results, because the built environment variables are
aggregated using a smaller sample. In contrast, generalizing the va-
lue of a built environment metric across a larger geographical unit
(e.g., within a 1000 m versus a 250 m buffer) will typically reduce
the sample variance for that particular metric, while increasing the
correlation between separate built environment variables. As a re-
sult, an observed statistical association may mask meaningful dif-
ferences that are obvious at a smaller scale (Bailey and Gatrell,
1995; Fotheringham and Wong, 1991). A zoning effect may be
present when analytical results are sensitive to the partitioning
of space. For example, different zone con<U+FB01>gurations under a <U+FB01>xed
scale may produce dissimilar results.
Despite a long-standing recognition in the geography literature
of the potential sensitivity of analytical results to the geographical
de<U+FB01>nition of spatial units, the MAUP has received less attention in
research that examines the built environment–transportation rela-
tionship. Some researchers have investigated the scale and zoning
effects of different built environment metrics on adults’ active tra-
vel and physical activity. For example, Zhang and Kukadia (2005)
explored mode choice for work and non-work trips in Boston, Mas-
sachusetts, using two different scale and zoning schemes (<U+FB01>ve buf-
fers and three census boundaries). The results indicated the
presence of both scale and zoning effects across spatial units. Berke
et al. (2007) examined the relationship between neighborhood
walkability, and physical activity or obesity, among the elderly in
King County, Washington. Their results suggested that the built
environment in<U+FB02>uenced walking across all three buffer distances
that were examined. Lastly, Duncan et al. (2010) investigated phys-
ical activity (i.e., walking for transportation) among adults living in
154 Census Collection Districts (CCD) in Adelaide, Australia. The
authors found that the duration of walking trips had a stronger
association with ‘‘corrected’’ measures of land use mix (i.e., stan-
dardized based on the geographical size of CCDs), compared to
the uncorrected land use measures within CCDs. Adjusting for
scale effects did not improve the results reported for models walk-
ing trip frequency. The MAUP is yet to be addressed in the AST
literature.
This paper examines the previously unexplored issue of how
the MAUP may be in<U+FB02>uencing the results of empirical research into
the relationship between objectively measured built environment
characteristics and children’s school travel behavior, particularly
the choice of active modes of travel to school. Two research ques-
tions are considered using data describing the travel behavior of
11–12 year olds in the City of Toronto, Canada: (1) at what scale
and for what type of zone system does the neighborhood built
environment have the strongest association with AST? and (2)
which built environment characteristics near home and school
locations are associated with the choice of an active mode for trips
to school? The article contributes a re<U+FB01>ned understanding of how
to model the built environment–active school transportation
(BE–AST) relationship, with a view to enhancing cross-study com-
parison. The research also improves current knowledge of the envi-
ronmental correlates of school travel mode choice in a North
American context.

2. Study design

The City of Toronto is the largest city in Canada, with a resident
population of over 2.5 million (Statistics Canada, 2008). The inner-
city neighborhoods in Toronto typically conform to what are
of Transport Geography 20 (2012) 51–61
known as main-street neighborhoods (i.e., residential neighbor-
hoods with employment-related land uses along the main streets)
in both the academic and popular literatures (Sewell, 1993). The
re-urbanization trend of the last several decades, which has been
hastened in recent years by favorable policy and market condi-
tions, has brought pockets of high-rise and high-density residential
developments to these neighborhoods. In contrast, the City of Tor-
onto’s suburban places are dominated by Modernist conventional
neighborhoods typically characterized by single-use residential
development and a street network design (e.g., curvilinear streets)
that is often associated with auto-oriented travel behavior.
AST is reasonably well practiced in the City of Toronto. In
2006, 49% of children aged 11–13 years actively traveled to
school. For the trips from school to home, the rate was even high-
er (56%) (Buliung et al., 2009). Toronto’s diverse urban environ-
ment and high rates of walking/cycling for school transportation
offer an excellent opportunity to explore the in<U+FB02>uence of the built
environment characteristics on children’s school travel mode
choice processes.
This study aims to examine the potential in<U+FB02>uence of MAUP on
the statistical modeling of the BE–AST relationship. Several recom-
mendations have been made in the literature to explore scale and
zoning effects (Fotheringham and Wong, 1991; Openshaw, 1984;
Zhang and Kukadia, 2005). Some researchers have suggested an
examination of the underlying pattern in the estimated coef<U+FB01>cients
of the built environment variables across different scales and zone
systems (Fotheringham and Wong, 1991; Zhang and Kukadia,
2005). This approach is tested here by modeling the BE–AST rela-
tionship using different spatial units and analytical scales for the
representation of neighborhoods. With regard to the correlates of
AST, this study adopts a social–ecological approach and hypothe-
sizes that household demographics, travel distance to school, and
the neighborhood environment in<U+FB02>uence the selection of school
travel modes (McMillan, 2005; Mitra, 2011; Sirard and Slater,
2008).

2.1. Travel data

Data were taken from the 2006 Transportation Tomorrow Sur-
vey (TTS). The TTS is a repeated cross-sectional survey of travel
behavior in Southern Ontario, Canada, conducted on a 5% sample
of all households in the study area. The 2006 TTS data were col-
lected for a randomly selected weekday, using a computer assisted
telephone interview procedure (Data Management Group, 2008,
2009). Household travel data (e.g., origin/destination of trips, trip
start time, purpose, primary travel mode) for all trips by household
members aged 11 years and older, associated with the day prior to
the interview, were proxy reported by an adult household member.
Previous research indicates that school travel behavior can change
with a child’s age (Buliung et al., 2009; Mitra, 2011; Panter et al.,
2008). In order to limit the scope of this study to a relatively
homogenous population, school travel data for children aged 11–
12 years (i.e., likely attending grades 5 or 6) were explored. All
home-to-school trips between the 6h00–9h30 time interval
(n = 2520) were extracted. Travel modes were collapsed into active
(i.e., walking and cycling trips) and passive (i.e., trips made by a
private automobile, public transit or school-bus) modes, using
the proxy reported data on primary mode of travel for school trips.

2.2. Neighborhood and built environment data
The modern conceptualization of the planned neighborhood
unit emerged in the early 1900s (Banerjee and Baer, 1984; Perry,
1939). The design principles of a neighborhood unit emphasized
Modernist concepts of spatial separation between home and work,
and a hierarchical street system (Banerjee and Baer, 1984; Moudon

R. Mitra, R.N. Buliung
et al., 2006). Elementary schools, community centers and other
smaller urban facilities were planned as central features of a neigh-
borhood, with surrounding residential development scaled to be
within a convenient walking distance (e.g., a 0.25 mi, or 400 m, ra-
dial distance) from the these facilities. The post World War II sub-
urban developments in Toronto were dominated by a widespread
implementation of the neighborhood unit idea (Filion and Ham-
mond, 2003; Hess, 2009). Urban planners assumed that within
the boundaries of a neighborhood, non residential activities of res-
idents will ‘‘<U+FB02>ow toward the core’’ (Banerjee and Baer, 1984, pp
183–4). However, this planning goal never fully materialized, per-
haps because most neighborhood centers did not offer essential
and desired services. Instead, these suburban neighborhoods have
led to an increased dependency on automobiles. Within this con-
text, previous research has indicated that the physical extent of a
neighborhood unit may be less important to households, and that
a household’s perceived neighborhood boundary can largely be de-
<U+FB01>ned based on the ‘‘action space’’ within which the household
members perform their daily activities, and consume goods and
services (Banerjee and Baer, 1984; Horton and Reynolds, 1971).
This observation, perhaps, is applicable to the older inner-city res-
idential areas as well, where the borders between the ‘‘neighbor-
hoods’’ are less clear. In the context of this concern around the
neighborhood boundaries, de<U+FB01>ning the neighborhood as a unit of
empirical analysis can present a methodical challenge (Moudon
et al., 2006).
In this paper, built environment characteristics were measured
within six different geographies, and two different scale and zon-
ing schemes (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The <U+FB01>rst scheme involved measur-
ing the built environment within various buffer distances around a
child’s home and school locations (four buffer distances- 250 m,
400 m, 800 m and 1000 m). In the second approach, neighborhoods
were de<U+FB01>ned using either the census boundary (dissemination area
– DA) or traf<U+FB01>c analysis zone (TAZ) within which a home or school
was located. Selection of these spatial units was informed by the
existing AST literature. The BE–AST associations were examined
at each level of geography, and were compared across different

scales/zoning systems. Environmental characteristics were mea-
sured at both the residence and school ends of a school trip. The
individual environmental variables that were analyzed are listed
in Table 2, where the hypothesized relationship with AST is also
reported.
Minimum travel distance between home and school locations
of a child was computed using Toronto’s street network <U+FB01>le
(DMTI CanMapÓ RouteLogistics <U+FB01>le, version 2007.3). Other neigh-
borhood characteristics related to street network design were also
obtained from the DMTI data. The employment-to-population ra-
tio (EMP_POP) was calculated using the TTS data, based on the
number of work-trip ends in each TAZ. TTS trip data were also
used to calculate the density of walking trips (WALK_DSTY) near
the home and school locations. To calculate block density, the
geographical boundary <U+FB01>les from the 2006 population census of
Canada were used. This study situates school travel behavior
within a social–ecological framework. Within this theoretical ap-
proach, the potential in<U+FB02>uence of neighborhood socio-economic
status was examined. LOWINCOME was, thus, conceptualized as
an environmental characteristic. In other words, socio-economic
status was measured at the neighborhood level. The median
household income data from the population census of Canada
were aggregated, within six different geographies around home
and school locations, to identify low income neighborhoods. In-
come data for individuals or households were not available for
analysis. Lastly, data on pedestrian and cyclist collisions occurred
during the 2002–2006 period were collected from City of Toron-
to’s Transportation Department; the data included the locations
of all fatal and non-fatal collisions reported to the Toronto Police
Service.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Binomial logistic regression was used to explore the correlates
of active versus passive mode choice for school trips (Pampel,
2000). A coef<U+FB01>cient (b    ^i ) from the multivariate logistic regression
models in this paper represent the un-confounded (i.e., adjusted)

Individual household income data was not available. Median household income was calculated using 2006 population census data by Statistics Canada. Average
household size for the sample was 4.3 (sd = 1.28). In a large metropolitan area such as Toronto (i.e., population > 500,000), the low income cut-off, de<U+FB01>ned by Statistics

independent variables down to only those variables holding a sta-

tistical signi<U+FB01>cance at p 6 0.05.

The degree of multi-collinearity across the built environment
variables was also examined, for each level of spatial aggregation
(Lee and Moudon, 2006; Mitra et al., 2010). The correlation be-
tween variables increased with the scale of spatial analysis. When
two variables were correlated (i.e., DEADEND_DTY and FOUR-
WAY_DTY; BLOCK_DTY and LOCAL_RD_DTY), those two were en-
tered into the multivariate (i.e., adjusted) model one at a time,
and the one with a weaker association (i.e., DEADEND_DTY; LO-
CAL_RD_DTY) was excluded from the <U+FB01>nal model speci<U+FB01>cation.
The built environment variables around the residence and near
the school were also highly correlated. To overcome this collinear-
ity problem, two sets of multivariate regression models were spec-
i<U+FB01>ed and estimated for each spatial unit, one for built environment
measures near the residence, and the other for the built environ-
ment near the school. A total of 12 multivariate logistic regression
models of active travel to school were estimated. Statistical analy-
ses were performed with RÓ version 2.9.0 (The R Foundation for
Statistical Computing).
The presence of scale effects was examined by observing
whether or not the coef<U+FB01>cient of a variable remained statistically
signi<U+FB01>cant across different scales of aggregation, and to a lesser ex-
tent, by assessing changes in the size and sign of the coef<U+FB01>cient val-
ues across different scales of spatial aggregation, within each
aggregation scheme (i.e., buffers or zones). The presence of poten-
tial zoning effects was examined by using the method suggested by
Fotheringham and Wong (1991) and Zhang and Kukadia (2005),
which involved an assessment of the built environment coef<U+FB01>-
cients across two spatial units at a comparable scale, between
the two zoning schemes (i.e., 250 m buffer versus DA, and 800 m
buffer versus TAZ). The standard-difference-of-means test [1]
was used to test the statistical difference in the estimated coef<U+FB01>-
cients obtained from the logistic regression models:

3. Results

Home-to-school trips by 11–12 year old children (n = 2190),
and the associated socio-demographic and environmental attri-
butes, were analyzed. Table 3 describes these attributes; summary
of the built environment measures are presented for each of the six
geographical units, around home and school locations, of all 11–
12 year old children. Results from the multivariate logistic regres-
sion models are presented in Tables 4 and 5. Most children used an
active mode for school transportation (58%); only 42% traveled to
school using passive modes (Table 3). The average school travel
distance (shortest path network distance) for these students was
1.25 km.

3.1. Scale effect

Table 3 suggested that the variance (square of the standard
deviation) of these environmental variables typically decreased
with an increase in neighborhood size. This type of ‘‘data smooth-
ing’’ at larger geographies is not unexpected (Zhang and Kukadia,
2005), and adds empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis
of decreasing sample variance with an increase in the scale of anal-
ysis, as previously mentioned in the introduction (Section 1). Scale
effects were explored further using the results from the adjusted
logistic regression models, presented in Tables 4 and 5.
The goodness of <U+FB01>t for the estimated models was very similar
across all six speci<U+FB01>cations (although a general trend of a weaker

were estimated for six different spatial units and entered into six
sets of logistic regression models of school travel mode choice
for trips to school. Only small variation in model <U+FB01>t was observed
across different geographical representations, which is not surpris-
ing given that the objectively measured built environment was
only moderately associated with AST. If the MAUP did not exist
across different geographical aggregation schemes, there would
also be little variation in the coef<U+FB01>cients of the built environment
variables among the estimated models (Fotheringham and Wong,
1991). Instead, the results indicated that the statistical signi<U+FB01>cance,
size, and in a few cases, the direction (i.e., the sign) of the built
environment coef<U+FB01>cients changed with a change in the scale for
spatial data aggregation. Statistically signi<U+FB01>cant differences in
regression coef<U+FB01>cients across different zoning schemes suggested
the presence of zoning effects.
While these results were suggestive of the presence of the
MAUP (i.e., scale and zoning effects) in statistical analysis of the
BE–AST relationship, they were not prescriptive. The statistically
signi<U+FB01>cant environmental coef<U+FB01>cients were not uniformly at their
largest value at any particular scale/zone system. A statistically
consistent/reliable spatial unit speci<U+FB01>cation for the study of school
travel behavior therefore may not exist, as different environmental
factors may operate on the mode choice process at different scales.
In general, for the City of Toronto, more built environment charac-
teristics were associated with mode choice when these environ-
mental measures were generalized to a 400 m buffer around
home and school locations, compared to buffers at other scales,
and spatial units taken from census or the TTS (i.e., producing dif-
ferent zoning effects).
Implicit to this and other studies that attempt to quantify rela-
tionships between local built environments and mode choice is the
assumption that the decision maker has complete and directionally
invariant environmental information around the origin, destina-
tion, and/or the travel route (e.g., the built environment within a
buffer distance or within a census boundary) (Lee and Moudon
2004; Schlossberg et al., 2006). In reality, perhaps, an individual’s
sense of place is more heavily in<U+FB02>uenced by the places he/she actu-
ally possesses some knowledge about (i.e., the action space) or
experiences directly (i.e., the activity space) within a neighbor-
hood, city, or region (Horton and Reynolds, 1971). The way in
which space and place are conceptualized in this study and others
like it, packaged as abstract and modi<U+FB01>able digital geographies
containing objectively measured data about the environment,
might evolve through additional engagement with the theoretical
and empirical studies of behavioral geography and more recent re-
search situated within a similar framework (Buliung and Kanarog-
lou 2006; Horton and Reynolds 1971).
With regard to the environmental correlates of AST, the school
transportation literature conceptualizes proximity to school and
safety as two major domains through which the built environment
in<U+FB02>uences walking/cycling (McMillan, 2005; Mitra, 2011). Similar
to previous research (e.g., Ewing et al., 2004; McDonald, 2008a;
Mitra et al., 2010), this paper indicates that school travel distance,
and thus, longer walk/cycle travel time, was an important factor in
mode choice for school transportation. Grade 5 students who tra-
vel 1 mi (translated as 1.5 or 1.6 km straight line distance) or more
are eligible for the school bus service offered by Toronto’s public
and catholic school boards, which may also reduce the propensity
of active traveling to school beyond that distance. This consistent
<U+FB01>nding is particularly important in the context of the economic
rationalization of public school systems that is currently underway
in the US and Canada (Basu, 2007; Schlossberg et al., 2006). Smaller
neighborhood elementary schools are closing and certainly there
has been an emerging conversation within school boards to con-
sider closure of neighborhood schools in favor of larger ‘‘economi-
cally ef<U+FB01>cient’’ alternatives. These larger schools will accommodate
of Transport Geography 20 (2012) 51–61                                     59
more students, from a larger area, potentially leading to increased
use of the automobile and other passive (or perhaps, less active)
modes such as school buses. The effect of this economic rationali-
zation of the supply of schools on school travel behavior should re-
ceive greater attention in research and policy.
Relating to traf<U+FB01>c and pedestrian safety, the regression results
suggest that signalized intersections (i.e., the proportion of street
intersections that are signal-controlled) were associated with ac-
tive travel to school, probably because of increased safety from
motorized traf<U+FB01>c. A neighborhood with smaller blocks (i.e., with
a higher block density), which is largely representative of an in-
ner-city, safe (from traf<U+FB01>c), and walkable environment, was also
associated with AST. This research also found a negative correla-
tion between a high proportion of four-way intersections (i.e., rep-
resenting a grid street network) and active travel. A grid-based
street network may encourage adult walk trips by providing in-
creased connectivity. But, this type of street network typically rep-
resents busy urban streets with potentially high traf<U+FB01>c volumes,
which may act as a barrier for active traveling to school.
In addition to the potential effects of street network design,
walking school trips were more common in neighborhoods where
other people walked for work or school travel purposes. A high
walking rate could be facilitated by neighborhood built environ-
ment characteristics (Ewing and Cervero, 2010; Transportation Re-
search Board, 2005). The WALK_DSTY variable was not correlated
with the other environmental measures that were examined, but
it may potentially capture the effects of some built environment
variations that remain unexplored in this study. With regard to
children’s school travel, a neighborhood with high prevalence of
walking can also produce a sense of pedestrian safety, and provide
opportunities to produce and maintain social capital (Leyden,
2003; Mitra et al., 2010). Previous research has found that parents
who valued the importance of a child’s interaction with others
(particularly, with other children) on the way to school were more
likely to let their children actively travel to school (McMillan,
2007; Timperio et al., 2006). In contrast, objectively measured
safety outcomes (i.e., the prevalence of collisions involving pedes-
trians/ cyclists near home or school) were not correlated with the
mode choice decision; similar <U+FB01>ndings have also been reported
elsewhere (Panter et al., 2010).
These results can be encouraging to the planning of a design
based intervention to enable AST among children, such as the ones
undertaken by the Federally funded Safe Routes to School (SRTS)
programs in the US and the community/grass-roots Active and Safe
Routes to School (ASRTS) campaign in Canada (Active and Safe
Routes to School, 2010; National Center for Safe Routes to School,
2007). Particularly in the US, the SAFETEA-LU federal transporta-
tion legislation in 2005 devoted $612 million to implement the
SRTS programs across the country. The individual SRTS programs
were undertaken between then and 2009, and much of the spend-
ing was focused on an improvement in the built environment along
school travel routes. Results from this study suggested that the de-
sign characteristics of a neighborhood that potentially create walk-
able and safe streets, particularly close to home locations, may
increase the odds of active travel among children.
This study has several strengths and limitations. The travel data
were drawn from a large population-based survey of travel behav-
ior. Residential and school locations of this large sample were sit-
uated across a diversely developed urban landscape within the City
of Toronto, which generated signi<U+FB01>cant variation in the built envi-
ronment measures. But, and similar to some other studies (e.g.,
Kerr et al., 2006; Larsen et al., 2009; Panter et al., 2010), travel
modes were generalized into broader ‘‘active’’ and ‘‘passive’’ cate-
gories. Recent empirical research has emphasized differences in
behavioral processes across individual travel modes, such as be-
tween driving, using transit, cycling and walking (Ewing et al.,

60                                                  R. Mitra, R.N. Buliung / Journal
2004; Lin and Chang, 2010; Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008).

While these potential differences are acknowledged, the purpose

of this research was to examine the use of active modes compared
to all other potential options, a topic that is relevant to the under-
standing of the geography of school transportation, and also to ur-

ban planning interventions.
Moreover, this paper purposefully explored AST behavior of 11–
12 year old children only. The adoption of this approach limits the

generalizability of <U+FB01>ndings to children and youth of other age
groups. The school travel mode choice process may indeed be mod-
erated by age (Mitra, 2011; Panter et al., 2008). The interaction be-

tween a child’s cognitive development with age, and a household’s
sense of place, could produce more autonomous travel as a child
ages, and also increase the use of different modes that are eventu-

ally matched to the growing spatial and social capabilities of aging
children (e.g., taking transit). These ‘‘age effects’’ are not well
understood, and remain an important area for empirical, policy-

based research.

Despite these limitations, this study makes an important con-
tribution by advancing the current approach to understanding
school travel behavior through quantitative analysis. Importantly,

this paper attempts to inform the emerging AST literature of the
role of geography, or arbitrary geographies, on the modeling and
understanding of children’s school travel behavior, an issue that

has not received adequate attention in the literature. This study
addressed the potential measurement errors due to MAUP, and
reported the BE–AST associations for six neighborhood represen-

tations. The results are suggestive of the presence of some scale
and zoning effects, evidence that supports the primary hypothesis
of this article that the MAUP may partly explain the inconsistency

in empirical <U+FB01>ndings of the existing AST literature. Having not ad-
dressed the MAUP issue adequately, studies that use a single geo-
graphical representation of the neighborhood construct may

produce misleading results. Future research can bene<U+FB01>t from fol-

lowing a similar procedure applied in this study for assessing po-
tential ecological uncertainty, and may report estimation results
at different levels of geographical aggregation. As suggested by

others (Zhang and Kukadia, 2005), a strong behavioral justi<U+FB01>ca-
tion for the selection of spatial units, which takes into account
the interaction between human behavior and the surrounding

physical environment, may also be a useful approach to consider.
