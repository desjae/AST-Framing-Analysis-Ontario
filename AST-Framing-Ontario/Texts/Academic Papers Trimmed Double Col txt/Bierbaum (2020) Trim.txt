Review Essay
Toward Mobility Justice: Linking Transportation and Education Equity
in the Context of School Choice
Ariel H. Bierbaum           Alex Karner          Jesus M. Barajas
    ABSTRACT
    Problem, research strategy, and findings: Transportation equity research addresses questions of
    participation and planning process or the distribution of transportation’s benefits and burdens. This work
    largely elides issues related to youth and student travel. Existing work on school trip mode choice does not
    engage deeply with the equity implications of its findings. Education equity researchers identify the abstract
    notion of choice as equity enhancing but do not engage with the realities of disparate transportation resources
    and infrastructure. In this review essay, we articulate the contours of transportation equity, youth travel, and
    school choice research. We use emerging perspectives on “mobility justice” to frame the issues and provide
    vocabulary that can help bring education and transportation together in planners’ everyday work.
    Takeaway for practice: A mobility justice framework encourages critical thought and action to address the
    root causes of inequities. Our conclusions make three contributions to research and practice: 1) challenging
    school district leaders to think about choice systems designed for access to schools, not just access to infor-
    mation about available options; 2) clarifying the broader implications of school choice by refusing to look
    away from the racial implications of forecasts; and 3) elucidating the need for a regional perspective.
