and discretionary travel. Jurisdictions with better transit supply and orientation have higher transit
mode shares for school trips, but discretionary trips have very low transit mode shares. Walk mode
shares for both school and discretionary travel are similar across all jurisdictions, regardless of whether
they are urban or suburban. In contrast to adult travel in the GTA, built form characteristics and transit
supply do not appear to have a direct relationship with teen mode choice. Urban form appears to exert
an indirect in<U+FB02>uence on teen travel.

likely to use active modes if given the opportunity. When children
enter their teenaged years they are no longer entirely bound to a
supervising adult’s schedule, habits and preferences and as a
result, begin to make independent travel decisions. In what ways
does this independence change his or her mobility patterns, if at
all? Understanding more about the way this group travels, even if
this understanding cannot be generalized to encompass the
behavior of the entire demographic, may provide insight into
how policy can better respond to overall mobility needs.

1.2. Current research on teenagers and transportation

There is a limited body of research exploring the speci<U+FB01>c
transportation needs of teens, and a slightly larger body of
research focused child travel in general, primarily the trip to
school. A general lack of access to independent means of travel
has been identi<U+FB01>ed, causing teens to rely on adults for much of
their travel. A study by McDonald (2006), using data from the
2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), shows that in
general, youth travel is automobile dominated with nearly 75% of
trips being made in private vehicles. This focus on the automobile
has major health and environmental implications, but also repre-
sents a constraint on the caregivers of teens without a driver’s
license. In fact, children have been included as a variable in
transportation studies to determine the extent of their in<U+FB02>uence
and constraint on the scheduling of activities and trips (Bhat,
1998; Damm and Lerman, 1981). The <U+FB01>ndings also have equity
implications; children are <U+FB01>ve times more likely to travel with
their mothers as with their fathers (McDonald, 2006). Several
other studies have also shown that women bear most of the
responsibility for chauffeuring children and make more trips to
serve passengers than men (McDonald, 2008; Blumenberg, 2004;
England, 1993; Kwan, 1999). Once youth reach driving age, their
behavior dramatically favors the automobile, with 40% of teens
aged 16–18 reporting to be the primary drivers of a household
vehicle. Research conducted in various communities in the United
States shows that teens gain greater independence as they age;
however, this independence comes with a greater reliance on the
automobile. Younger teens use a wider variety of modes (Clifton,
2003). By late adolescence, the automobile is a well established
part of the lives of American teens. Relatively little is known
about the degree of automobile dependence amongst teenagers in
the Canadian context.
The degree of auto-dependency and lack of independent travel
amongst American teens can partially be attributed to a general
lack of transit use. There are over 28 million teenagers in the
United States, making up approximately 9–21 percent of U.S.
transit ridership depending on urban area size (Cain, 2006).
Transit accounts for approximately 1–3 percent of teenagers’
aggregate person trips. This can be attributed to lack of transit
supply, reliability issues, safety concerns, cost and general nega-
tive perceptions associated with public transit travel (Cain 2006).
Another growing concern is the reduction in active travel
mode-use for both discretionary and school travel. Studies show
that the issue of active travel can be linked to variables that are
not always directly linked to urban form. Kerr et al. (2007) look at
pedestrian travel in Atlanta by youths aged 5–18 years. The
results show a more signi<U+FB01>cant relationship between urban form
variables and the travel choices of people in high-income house-
holds. Among low-income and non-white youth, environmental
variables generally exhibited weak associations with the choice to
walk. This suggests that lack of vehicle access creates a necessity
to walk that would exist regardless of whether a neighborhood is
walkable or not. Tal and Handy (2008) examine children’s biking
for non-school purposes, speci<U+FB01>cally exploring the factors asso-
ciated with biking to Saturday morning youth soccer games in
Policy 18 (2011) 623–630
Davis, California. The <U+FB01>ndings show that over three-quarters of
players and their parents drove to the game, with fewer than 20%
biking. While the distance from home to the game is a signi<U+FB01>cant
deterrent to using non-motorized modes, players who bike to
school and whose parents bike regularly are much more likely to
bike to the games. Although this study focuses on a very speci<U+FB01>c
case, it points to the need for more research exploring the
in<U+FB02>uence of physical, attitudinal and logistical factors on a child’s
mode choice.
Recently, there has been attention placed on the trip to school,
focusing on the shift from children walking to school to be
predominantly driven there by a parent (Grize et al., 2010;
Buliung et al., 2009; Ewing et al., 2004; Fulton et al., 2005;
McMillan, 2005; McDonald, 2006). McMillan (2007) examines
the in<U+FB02>uence of urban form on the trip to school, as well as the
magnitude of in<U+FB02>uence urban form and non-urban form factors
have on children’s travel behavior. The study focuses on 16
elementary schools in California in order to assess ways in which
the Safe Routes to School (SR2S) policies can be made more
effective. Odds ratios indicate that perceptions of neighborhood
and traf<U+FB01>c safety, transportation options and social/cultural
norms have a greater magnitude of in<U+FB02>uence on travel behavior
than that of urban form. However, it was found that the urban
form variables contributed signi<U+FB01>cantly to the model <U+FB01>t.
Again, there is relatively little work done in the Canadian
context. Buliung et al. (2009) studied the spatial trends in active
transportation of children aged 11–15 for school trips in the
Greater Toronto Area. Similar to other studies, they found that
between 1986 and 2006, walking mode share for trips to school
declined signi<U+FB01>cantly. Children aged 11–13 walked more in urban
regions that in the suburban regions; however, children aged
14–15 walked more in the suburbs and took transit more in the
urban regions. The results point to a general need for more active
transportation policies and programs.


2. Methodology and data

The GTA is Canada’s largest metropolitan region. It includes
the City of Toronto and four surrounding municipalities (Durham,
York, Peel and Halton). As a whole, it is similar to other North
American cities, exhibiting trends such as increasing individual
auto-ownership and auto-driver trip rates, as well as increasing
suburbanization of the population and employment into areas
poorly served by transit (Miller and Shalaby, 2003). At the same
time, the GTA (particularly the City of Toronto) deviates from
some of these patterns. The continuing strength of the Toronto
central area has allowed for the provision of strong, viable transit
service and orientation. Furthermore, there is high-density devel-
opment throughout even the inner suburban portions of the city.
Thus, while current trends are headed in an unsustainable
direction, the region possesses the potential required to facilitate
an ef<U+FB01>cient transportation system for all travelers.
This paper presents a descriptive analysis of the evolution of
teen travel in the GTA from 1986 to 2006, with a focus on current
trends. The reason for this analysis is to gain a general under-
standing of how teenagers in the GTA travel and the kinds of
choices they make in relation to their region of residence. Four
research questions are examined: (1) How has teen mode choice
varied over time? (2) How do these choices vary as teens
transition from the 13–15 age group to being of driving age
(16–19)? (3) How do these choices vary across the different urban
and suburban regions of the GTA? (4) What are some of the
differences between teen travel and adult travel?
The data analyzed are drawn from the Transportation Tomor-
row Survey (TTS), a large-scale personal travel behavior survey

R. Marzoughi / Transpo
undertaken in the GTA. The TTS is an on-going survey program
that consists of a 1-day telephone interview of GTA residents
every 5 years, using consistent survey instruments and proce-
dures. The latest version was conducted on behalf of twenty-one
local and provincial agencies.
The 1986 TTS includes completed interviews for a 4.2% ran-
dom sample of all households in the GTA (171, 086 persons). The
1991 TTS data are not used because the sample was limited to
speci<U+FB01>c areas exhibiting large population growth. The 1996 (312,
781 persons), 2001 (374, 182 persons) and 2006 (401, 653
persons) data were analyzed, each one using a sample size of
5%. Travel behavior for randomly selected households (including
children 11 years or older) was proxy reported by an adult
household member.

2.1. Limitations

One limitation of the TTS data set is its treatment of discre-
tionary travel. Discretionary travel is de<U+FB01>ned as all trips other
than home-based work and home-based school. The TTS survey
divides these trips into three sub-categories: home-based shop-
ping, home-based other and non-home-based. Unfortunately, due
to the use of third-party respondents to report trips made by
other household members, discretionary travel is under reported
in this survey. The under reporting is signi<U+FB01>cant with respect to
public transit, auto-driver and cycling trips; however, the TTS
provides correction factors. Due to this limitation, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to
get a rich picture of teen discretionary travel patterns. The survey
data is more reliable in terms of the trip to and from school.
Further to this issue, total trip-making is underestimated
because walk trips are recorded for work and school trips only
in the TTS survey. Bicycle trips are recorded for all trip purposes
in the 1996, 2001 and 2006 surveys, but only for school and work
trips for the 1986 survey. Thus, the TTS data provides an adequate
preliminary trend assessment of overall teen travel, but supple-
mentary data are needed in order to <U+FB01>ll in the details (Fig. 1).


3. Results—GTA trends (1996–2006)

In order to understand teen mobility in the GTA, there are a
few key points regarding the public transportation system that
must be mentioned. Downtown Toronto and its inner suburban
ring are served by the highly coordinated Toronto Transit Com-
mission (TTC). The TTC consists of a grid network of surface routes
(buses and streetcars) covering the city and feeding into a radial
subway system. The rest of the GTA is served by buses with
varying levels of frequency and reliability. Many neighborhoods
in the downtown core are considered to be pedestrian friendly.
They exhibit principles that promote livability as highlighted by
Jane Jacobs, such as short blocks, a mix of uses, a mix of old and
new buildings and suf<U+FB01>cient density to support transit (Jacobs,
1961). There are approximately 700,000 teens aged 13–19

currently traveling in this region, representing about 10% of all
GTA travelers.
The presence of viable public transportation is a likely
in<U+FB02>uence on a teen’s decision to obtain a driver’s license or a
transit pass. Table 1 shows that in the urban city of Toronto,
there has been a 10% decrease in the percentage of teens aged
16–19 with a license over the past two decades. Conversely, in
the suburban municipalities the numbers have not dropped
signi<U+FB01>cantly, and have even increased slightly (York, Halton).
In 2001, all municipalities exhibit an upward spike in the
percentage of teens (16–19) with a license, and a drop in the
percentage of teens (13–19) with a transit pass (Table 2). Table 2
also shows that Toronto exhibits the largest growth in the
number of teens with a transit pass (4%), followed by Hamilton
(2%). This is not surprising in light of the superior transit supply
available in these municipalities. The dip in transit passes in
2001 is possibly due to survey collection error.

3.1. Overall trip generation and modal shares from 1986 to 2006

Throughout the GTA, teens aged 13–19 average a daily trip
rate of 2.5 trips per day. Daily trip rates are generally higher in
the suburban municipalities than in the urban municipalities. If
the trip rates are disaggregated by type, it is clear that teens aged
16–19 are making a wider variety of trips, with more discre-
tionary, non home-based and work trips being made. Overall,
trip rates have not changed appreciably over the past two
decades (Table 3).
Between 1986 and 2006, there has been an increase in
personal automobile travel for all teens, particularly in terms of
auto-passenger travel (see Fig. 2). This increase is evident in both
age groups. Passenger mode shares have increased signi<U+FB01>cantly
for the younger group (13–15), from 22.1% to 39.7%. This increase
is met with an 8.6% drop in active travel mode shares (walking
and biking), and an 8.3% drop in transit shares. Parents and
caregivers are likely facilitating this modal shift by driving teens
to their various destinations. The 16–19 year olds are also
exhibiting a shift toward auto-passenger mode, showing an
increase of 11.1% over the past two decades. It is interesting to
note, however, that auto-driver mode shares have decreased from
22.8% to 14.8%. This could suggest a drop in independent travel
for this age group. Unfortunately, at this time the TTS survey does
not collect information on whether a trip is made alone or with a
companion (parent, caregiver, friend, sibling, etc.). For the older
age group, the active travel modal shares have not changed
appreciably over the past 20 years, while the transit share has
seen a 3.9% drop.

3.2. Trip to school and discretionary travel 1986–2006

To better understand the differences in mode choice between
the two age cohorts across the GTA region, school and discre-
tionary travel are examined more closely. As expected, there has
whole GTA region by type and year.

626                                                        R. Marzoughi
been a slight decline in overall walk mode shares for both age
groups, as well as a notable increase in auto-passenger mode
shares. The younger teens tend to walk to and from school more
than the older teens (8–12% larger walk mode shares). This could
be because elementary school catchment areas are generally
smaller than those of high schools. Also, within the GTA, several
high schools have special programs (e.g. French immersion, music
and art focused streams, accelerated mathematics streams, etc.),
allowing students to attend schools that are not located within
their neighborhood. It also appears that the older group uses
public transit more, while the younger group uses the school bus
more, particularly in suburban regions. This is because in the City
of Toronto, when a child attending middle school (grades 6–8) or
high school (grades 9–12) lives more than 4.8 km from their
school, they do not have the option of school bus transportation
but can request to receive TTC tickets from the school board.
The auto-driver mode shares for the trip to school (16–19 age
group) have decreased across all jurisdictions over the past two

decades. This is likely related to the introduction of graduated
licensing in Ontario in 1994. The process begins with a written
test, allowing the teenager to drive while supervised by an adult
with over <U+FB01>ve years of driving experience. After 12 months (or
8 months if a certi<U+FB01>ed training course is taken), the teen can take
a road test, and if he/she passes, can then drive unsupervised
provided he/she abides by a strict set of regulations. After another
12 months, the teen can take a second road test, which if passed
will allow him/her to obtain a full license. This graduated
licensing scheme comes with a set of complicated insurance
regulations, which, if not followed, can result in high premiums.
In Toronto and Hamilton the car trips are replaced by transit
trips. In the suburban municipalities, they are replaced by an
increase in auto-passenger trips. This may indicate that urban
areas with better transit supply provide more of an opportunity
for older teens to travel independently.
Another interesting result is that from 1986 to 2006, there is
little variation in walk mode shares across the GTA jurisdictions.
It could be expected that the suburban-style built form would be
less conducive to walking than the urban-style one. However, the
results show that in 2006, for teens aged 16–19, the suburban
municipalities of Durham, Peel and Halton even have a slightly
2006
larger walk mode share than Toronto and Hamilton. This suggests
37.5
that if schools are located reasonably close to the homes of
54.4         students, they are likely to walk there. Although York, the fastest
56.7         growing suburban jurisdiction, has the smallest walk mode share,
50.4         it is the only municipality that shows an increase in walk mode
59.1
shares for both age groups over the past two decades (4.2% for
46.9
teens aged 16–19). This suggests that regardless of neighborhood
level urban form, the desire to walk, bike and take transit to
school exists amongst this age group.
Looking at discretionary travel mode shares, it is clear that
the private automobile dominates (Tables 4 and 5). For teens
aged 13–15, the passenger mode share has increased by 12.1% in
2006
Toronto (urban), 12.9% in Hamilton (semi-urban), 4.6% in York
17.9
(suburban) and 3.12% in Peel (suburban). For teens aged 16–19,
12.4         the increase has been very dramatic, from an 8.5% increase in
8.1        Halton (suburban) to a 22.1% increase in Peel. Equally dramatic
5.4        is the decrease in auto-driver mode shares for this age group.
6.2
Driver shares have dropped anywhere from 13.3% in Halton to
16.4
25.4% in Peel. These <U+FB02>uctuations do not seem to be signi<U+FB01>cantly
tied to the urban form, as changes have similar magnitude and
direction across the board. It appears that 16–19 year olds are
increasingly being driven around by others (parents, friends,

siblings) as opposed to driving themselves. Again, this <U+FB01>nding
16–19         must be considered in light of the introduction of stricter
licensing regulations, as well as increases in teen driver insur-
2.44          ance premiums.
2.56               Transit mode shares have also decreased for both age groups

in all jurisdictions. The drop is particularly signi<U+FB01>cation for the
13–15 year olds, from a 2.6% drop in Halton to a 19.8% drop in
mode shares for teens in GTA region.

Hamilton. In Toronto, there has been a 15.1% drop in discretionary
transit mode shares despite the superior transit supply in this
jurisdiction. This could be due to fare increases coupled with a
lack of transit investment in these areas. In contrast, walk mode
shares have increased across all jurisdictions for both age groups.
For the 13–15 age group, Durham and Hamilton have had the
greatest increase in walk mode shares (4.4% and 6.8%, respec-
tively). York region, a typical suburban municipality, has seen a
3.1% growth in walk mode shares, which is higher than the 2.2%
growth in Toronto. For the older age group, Halton (another
suburban jurisdiction) exhibits the largest growth in walk shares
(5.3%). These results are surprising given the assumption that
teens are more likely to walk and take transit for discretionary
travel in Toronto than in the suburban areas (Fig. 3).

3.3. Teen travelers as compared to adult travelers in the GTA

To assess some of the ways in which teen and adult travel
patterns differ, mode choice by trip type and trip length are
examined for three age groups: 13–15, 16–19 and 20–70. Data
from 2006 for Toronto (urban) and Halton (suburban) are exam-
ined. Considering Tables 6 and 7, it is clear that regardless of trip
type, auto-driver is by far the dominant mode for adult travelers
in both jurisdictions. Unlike teen travelers, adult mode choice
follows a more predictable pattern in relation to neighborhood-
level built form attributes. In Halton, where there is poor transit
supply, low residential density (approximately 20 dwellings/
hectare), and mostly single-use development, auto-driver mode
shares are very high (71.14–90.31%). In Toronto where there is
strong, viable transit supply, higher residential density (approxi-
mately 150 dwellings/hectare), grid-pattern street networks with
mixed-use development and other pedestrian amenities, walk
and transit shares are higher. Adult home-based work and school
trips have a walk mode share of 6.53% and 14.74%, respectively,
both lower than the walk mode shares for both teen age groups.
Halton has very small walk and transit mode shares of less that 2%
for all trip types except home-based school. Adult transit shares
are highest in Toronto, representing 32.02% of home-based work
trips and 60.83% of home-based school trips. Furthermore, in
contrast to adult travelers, teen traveler auto-passenger mode
shares appear to be much less dominant for all trip types and
jurisdictions.
Policy 18 (2011) 623–630                                             627
Looking at the trip lengths, the data show that 80% of the trips
to school for teens 13–19 are less than 5 km, which is ideal for

using modes such as walking, biking or public transportation. The
discretionary trip pro<U+FB01>le shows the tendency toward longer trip
lengths, which corresponds to the dominance of motorized modes
for these trips. It would be interesting to collect more detailed
data in order to determine what kinds of discretionary trips teens


in the GTA are making and why they are perhaps longer than their
trips to school.
Modal split by trip length (2006 data) for teens and adults in
Toronto and Halton are shown in Fig. 4. Again, it can be seen that
regardless of neighborhood built form, teens in both age groups
walk for approximately half of their trips that are less that 2 km
(1.2 miles) in length. Conversely, the built form does seem to have
a relationship with adult walk shares. In Toronto, for trips less
than 2 km (1.2 miles), the walk mode share is 14.46% but drops to

2.94% in Halton.
For trips over 2 km (1.2 miles), the neighborhood urban form
and transit supply impact mode shares for all three age groups in

different ways. For teens in Toronto, as the trip length increases,


so do auto-passenger shares (especially for the 13–15 year olds)
and transit shares (especially for the 16–19 year olds). Although
the driver mode is dominant for adults in Toronto, transit does
exhibit a strong presence. In Halton, teen transit shares are low
for trips over 5 km (3 miles). Adult transit shares are even lower
than those of teens, particularly in Halton, where they shrink to
almost zero. The lack of transit supply likely contributes to the
increase in auto-driver mode shares for longer distances in both
these jurisdictions. Finally, while teens in both municipalities
walk for about half of their trips under 2 km (1.2 miles) and
around 5% of their trips that are 3–5 km in length, adults almost
never walk for any trip over 2 km (1.2 miles). This can be partially
attributed to the difference in nature of trip-making behavior
amongst adults and teens. For example, adults make provisionary
trips (e.g. grocery shopping) that are made easier when traveling
by car. Also, the trip to work is generally unconstrained for adults,
whereas the trip to school often falls within the neighborhood.
The difference in mode choice could also be a result of teens not
having access to an automobile and having to make do with
walking or transit, regardless of preference.
If the data are examined further, it is clear that adult trip
lengths are predominantly longer than those taken by teens aged
13–19. The portion of trips that are over 2 km (1.2 miles) drops by
14% as soon as the trip-maker region of residence moves from the
downtown core to the inner urban core. This portion drops
another 3–5% as the trip-maker’s region of residence moves from
the inner urban core to the inner ring (Etobicoke, North Toronto,
Scarborough) and outer ring suburbs (York and Halton regions).
This is due primarily to employment destinations, but also to
discretionary travel destinations. It could also be a result of
differing attitudes, preferences and personal freedom. Overall,
the results are interesting and suggest that teens and adults travel
in signi<U+FB01>cantly distinct ways. It is important to make genuine
attempts at understanding the differences in order to meet the
needs of various groups of travelers, who use the transportation
system in different ways.


4. Discussion and conclusion

The examination of teen travel between 1986 and 2006 in the
GTA using TTS data is revealing in several ways. Overall, there has
been an increase in personal automobile travel for both age
groups, particularly in terms of auto-passenger travel. For teens
aged 13–15, the increase in auto-passenger mode has been met
with a decrease in active travel mode shares and transit shares.

Fig. 4. Modes shares by trip length fo
For the older group, the auto-passenger mode has increasingly
dominated the auto-driver mode, suggesting a drop in indepen-
dent travel.
It appears that, currently, teens in this region mostly walk or
take transit to school, but are driven around by others for most of
their discretionary trips. From 1986 to 2006, there is little
variation in school trip walk mode shares across the GTA
jurisdictions. Regardless of neighborhood-level built form, teens
in the GTA make a signi<U+FB01>cant number of walk trips. Nevertheless,
there has been a slight decline over the years in active travel to
school throughout the region for both age groups, and a sharper
decline in auto-driver trips to school for the older group. In urban
jurisdictions, these trips are replaced with transit and in suburban
jurisdictions they are replaced with auto-passenger trips. This is
an indication that transit supply and transit-oriented land-use
provide more choice for teens and possibly induce a more
autonomous mobility pro<U+FB01>le. In the same vein, the data show
that areas with better transit supply exhibit larger growth in the
number of teens with transit passes and a signi<U+FB01>cant decrease in
the percentage of teens aged 16–19 with a license over the past
two decades. This suggests that the driver’s license as a symbol of
adulthood and freedom may not be as entrenched in the GTA as it
was in Clifton’s (2003) study of American teens.
As mentioned, the examination of discretionary travel reveals
the prevalence of the private automobile in teen travel. Auto-
passenger mode shares have increased dramatically for both age
groups, with the older group increasingly being driven around by
others (parents, friends and siblings). Surprisingly, walk mode
shares have also increased across all jurisdictions for both age
groups. Suburban areas with minimal pedestrian amenities

r teen and adult travelers in Toronto and Halton for 2006.
exhibit a greater growth in walk shares than Toronto. In contrast
to the trip to school, transit use for discretionary travel has
decreased in all jurisdictions, regardless of transit supply or
built form.
As expected, teens choose to walk for short trips and seldom
walk for trips that are over 5 km (3 miles). Usually, transit or
auto-passenger modes are used for longer trips. Generally, the
trips taken by teens in these areas are less than 10 km (6 miles). It
appears that the trip to school is often short and that discre-
tionary trips are longer. This corresponds to the <U+FB01>nding that teens
generally do not walk for their discretionary travel. Nevertheless,
regardless of their region of residence, approximately 50% of their
trips are short (under 2 km/1.2 miles), a sharp contrast to the trip
length pro<U+FB01>le of adults in the same regions. This is possibly due to
schools generally being located within a child’s neighborhood,
whereas employment can be scattered all over the GTA. The
discrepancy could also be a result of difference in attitudes
toward discretionary travel.
An important <U+FB01>nding from this study is the signi<U+FB01>cant differ-
ence between teen and adult travel behavior, particularly in terms
of their correspondence with conventional travel behavior asso-
ciated with certain built form attributes. Years of research has
shown that adult travelers are more likely to walk or take transit
in areas with strong, viable transit supply, higher residential
density (approximately 150 dwellings/hectare), grid-pattern
street networks with mixed-use development and other pedes-
trian amenities. Conversely, in suburban areas with single-use
development, spread out amenities and lower residential density,
adults are more likely to drive. The analysis of the TTS data for
adults in the GTA generally conforms to these ideas. On the other

630                                                R. Marzoughi / Transport
hand, the analysis of the same data for teens aged 13–19 is less
predictable. As mentioned, in some cases transit supply and built
form seem to have an impact on the decision to walk or take
transit, and in other cases, teens choose to walk or take transit
despite built form differences.

The results of the analysis support the hypothesis that neigh-
borhood-level urban form is an important factor, but perhaps not

directly linked to a teen’s decision about school or discretionary

travel. If this is the case, other factors, such as real or perceived
neighborhood safety, traf<U+FB01>c, household transportation options or

scheduling, caregiver attitudes and socio-demographics, may be

equally or even more important. These results are similar to those
of McMillan (2007), which suggest that programs focusing on
modi<U+FB01>cations to urban form to increase walking or biking may

see little change in modal splits. Both studies <U+FB01>nd that planning
decisions should be based on understanding the needs of all
travelers, especially those who are dependent users of the

transportation system.
From a transportation planning and policy perspective, the
overall <U+FB01>ndings offer hope for increasing the use of alternative

modes. Teenagers, like other travelers with limited access to

automobiles, are more reliant on walking and transit for their
trips. Contrary to American teens (Clifton, 2003), teens in down-
town Toronto are not abandoning walking and transit as soon as

the automobile becomes an option. Thus, there is a desire to walk
or take transit, as long as use of these modes is an option.
Increasing the frequency of certain transit routes in suburban

areas would provide these teens with the opportunity to take
transit for more of their discretionary trips, rather than receiving
rides. Also, improving pedestrian infrastructure in suburban areas

by adding pathways, sidewalks and traf<U+FB01>c calming measures such

as painted lines that reduce street-width, could go a long way in
encouraging teens to walk.
Further work should be done to take a closer look at the kinds

of discretionary trips teens in the GTA are making. Are they
usually driven to these activities as is suggested by the TTS data?
Are these trips generally longer than their trip to school? Do these

trips differ for various age cohorts? And <U+FB01>nally, who ultimately
makes the mode choice — is it the teen’s decision or the parents’
decision to use the auto-passenger mode? Are these teens being

driven around because they lack adequate means of transit; or are

other personal or parental concerns such as the dangers of traf<U+FB01>c
or fear of crime driving this decision? Determining the constraints
on discretionary travel, and whether these constraints are in<U+FB02>u-

encing the ‘‘choice’’ to be driven around, will help inform transit
policy that can effectively meet the needs of this demographic.
Exploring these questions may require conducting interviews

or focus groups with different groups of teenagers around the
GTA. It may also require collecting more detailed data regarding
mode choice and attitudes toward various modes. While the

results presented con<U+FB01>rm that built form is one of many factors

that shape teen travel, they do not reveal the other factors
involved in the process. For example, what role do attitudes and

perceptions play in the decision-making process, and how are

these attitudes shaped? The key will be to tease out the various
factors that mingle in order determine the trip-making process for
Policy 18 (2011) 623–630
this group. This understanding can help with the development of
policy that encourages more active travel amongst teens, and
hopefully, other groups of travelers.
