(World Health Organization, 2020). Active School Transportation (AST)
contributes to achieving the recommended exercise rates among chil-
dren and teenagers.
AST has been studied intensively due to its manifold positive effects.
The literature confirms that it contributes to improving children's
health, as it impacts their physical, social and mental development and
overall well-being (Schoeppe et al., 2013; Stark et al., 2018c; Waygood
et al., 2020). Independent mobility in children is associated with child
health, including good motor skills, cognitive development (Scheiner,
2016) and a better understanding of their surrounding environment
(Mitra and Buliung, 2015). Waygood et al. (2017) explore the way AST
promotes social interactions for children during their trip to school in
Canada, Japan and Sweden, and its importance for their personal well-
being. As important spillover effects, AST has direct implications for the
environment and sustainable transportation, as it reduces accompanied
transport and leads to a decrease in congestion and pollution.
The aim of this paper is to gain a better understanding of mobility
patterns in children and teenagers in regard to their travel choice to
school in a hilly urban environment, and to discuss measures to im-
prove sustainable mobility. The case study in this work is the city of
Dresden in eastern Germany, whose sustainable transport policy was
recognized by the Civitas initiative in 2005 (Civitas, 2013). This study
focuses on secondary schools (Gymnasium in German), attended by
students between 10 and 19 years old, and offers a detailed analysis of
the factors that contribute to AST by analysing the height profile of the
cycling routes taken to school, thus increasing the reliability of the
outcomes. One limitation of our study is the lack of additional personal
information and environmental variables discussed in the literature.
This paper is divided into seven sections. After the introduction and
background, the third section describes the case study. Section four
focuses on the methodology and data. The fifth section presents the
model specification, and section six reports the results. Finally, section
seven contains the conclusions and discusses the main findings and
implications of this study.

2. Background

As discussed by various authors (Mackett, 2013; Mitra and Buliung,
2015), the way children and teenagers commute to school has notably
evolved in the last few decades. In the past, students would have been
more likely to commute unaccompanied to school. Current worldwide
trends in car ownership and car-oriented urban developments have
directly transformed the way children go to school, as they now tend to
be escorted by motorized transport modes, while the distance to the
nearest school has also increased.
Several studies deal with AST in various developed countries, such
as those by Shaw et al. (2015), Habib and Daisy (2013), Yang and
Markowitz (2012), Mitra and Buliung (2015) and Curtis et al. (2015).
Many authors point out that apart from personal socio-demographic
information, family background, socio-cultural and economic char-
acteristics, along with geographical, spatial, and urban factors, all have
a major influence on the preference for a certain mode.
Gender is a controversial topic in the literature. Some authors report
that it influences AST whereas others find no influence. For example,
the studies by Scheiner et al. (2019a, 2019b) with information from
children aged 6 to 10 show that primary school girls are escorted more
often than boys, most notably those aged 6–7 years, and that female
children are less likely to choose cycling as model choice, especially on
morning trips. The study by van Goeverden and de Boer (2013) using
data from Dutch and Flemish national travel surveys and information
from children attending primary and secondary education shows that
girls may travel less independently than boys because they are exposed
to higher security risks. This variable is significant in Flanders, whereas
in the Netherlands there is no impact. Conversely, Kemperman and
Timmermans (2014) found that in children between 4 and 11 years in
the Netherlands gender has no relation with either active travel

behaviour or with any of the other variables in their analysis. Helbich
et al. (2016) focused on a subsample of 97 children aged 6 to 11 years in
six elementary schools in mid- to large-sized Dutch cities with GPS
available information; they also reported gender to be insignificant, as
did Stark et al. (2018c), who only found out that male children rated
biking as being “cooler”. The latter authors observe that a larger het-
erogeneous sample would be necessary to get more insights about
gender.
Deka (2013) studies how parents' mode of travel to work is directly
interrelated with children's trip mode to school in the United States. If
the parents choose to drive to work, children are likely to be dropped
off at school, hence decreasing the possibilities of AST. The study by
Stark et al. (2018b) in Austria highlights the importance of parents'
attitudes for an understanding of the mobility patterns of primary
school children, as they may subsequently influence how their children
will commute alone to their secondary and tertiary education. In the
study by Pojani and Boussauw (2014) in Albania, most of the children
who were driven to school came from higher income families.
Studies such as that of Sharmin and Kamruzzaman (2017) show that
the country and regional context also play a major role. For example,
Finnish children and young people are traditionally very independent
in their mobility (Kyttä et al., 2015); in the study by Sarjala et al. (2016)
in two different regions in Finland, children were escorted by parents
on only 7% of trips. In contrast to children in developed countries,
children in developing countries may rank choices differently. For ex-
ample, in the case study of Kanpur, India (Singh and Vasudevan, 2018),
the authors highlight that children rely on motorized modes such as
family cars and paratransit modes in detriment from active modes due
to an unbalanced distribution of schools, along with the lack of good-
quality school bus services, the low standard of the public transport
infrastructure, and the inadequate safety of the pedestrian and cycling
infrastructure. They also observe that the students' mode choice reflects
a gender-biased society.
Many authors point to the inextricably intertwined relation between
active transportation and the built environment. Rodri´guez and Joo
(2004) highlight the positive effects of active transportation on the built
environment, as it fosters the presence of mixed land use and higher
employment and population density. Sarjala et al. (2016) analyses
children and adolescent mobility in Finland by using a Topographic
Dataset produced by the National Land Survey of Finland (SLICES da-
taset) which includes land use, land cover, soil types and special use
and restricted areas. They found that places with large commercial
buildings and green environments had the highest proportions of car
use. Scheiner et al. (2019a, 2019b) give a thorough analysis with de-
tailed information on the built environment and on many other vari-
ables that influence AST in Lünen, Germany. The authors found that
traffic calming routes are associated with more independent mobility
for children. Helbich et al. (2016) studied commuting patterns of
children aged 6–11 years and found that well-connected streets and
cycling lanes are positively associated with AST; the authors describe
the horizontal dimension with a rich set of built environmental char-
acteristics. The meta-analysis by Sharmin and Kamruzzaman (2017)
also suggests that a wide variety of land-use patterns and a convenient
street design helps promote policies for children's independent mobi-
lity. Broberg and Sarjala (2015) mention that major roads on the school
journey lower the odds of cycling to school, and that dense school
networks support AST. Other authors also mention that school spatial
planning plays an important role in fostering active mobility in
schoolchildren; this is the case of Boussauw et al. (2014) for primary
schools in northern Belgium. Similarly, Marique et al. (2013) also
mention, based on two decennial surveys in Belgium, that well-dis-
tributed, decentralised nursery and primary school services reduce the
use of private cars and encourage more walking and cycling alter-
natives.
Longer trips clearly hinder walking and cycling alternatives, espe-
cially for children, as confirmed by Stark et al. (2018a) in their study of

secondary pupils in Austria and Germany. Although some authors re-
port that active transportation may increase the risk of injury from
collisions (Vanparijs et al., 2020) and health risks due to exposure to
motor vehicles and their emissions, this risk declines significantly as the
number of people using active modes rises (Reynolds et al., 2010). In
overall terms, the benefits of physical activity outweigh the traffic-as-
sociated disadvantages, as highlighted by Mueller and colleagues
(Mueller et al., 2015). Indeed, authors like Lopes et al. (2014) focus on
the importance of transforming a motorized city through walkable
policies to foster safe AST.
In order to propose specific measures to foster AST, it is important to
analyse the factors that promote active school transportation among
children and young people. As it plays such a key role, the urban en-
vironment must be studied in greater depth. To our knowledge, there
are limited examples of the use of technology systems or devices to
determine and understand more accurately which other factors in the
urban environment influence active transportation for children and
adolescents; questionnaires and interviews tend to be used, probably
due to legal restrictions. One such study by Verhoeven et al. (2018)
considers cycling trips by secondary school adolescents using global
positioning systems. However in terms of slope conditions, most studies
focus mainly on adults. For example, Rodri´guez and Joo (2004), Li et al.
(2012), Broach et al. (2012), Paige Willis et al. (2013) and Milakis and
Athanasopoulos (2014) analyse cycling route choice in adults, in most
cases for commuting purposes. Li et al. (2012) use a dummy variable as
a proxy for hilly and flat urban environments to inform perception of
cycling comfort. Broach et al. (2012) take three alternatives (catego-
rical variables) for the part of the route with a certain average upslope
in order to choose a cycling route. Paige Willis et al. (2013) ask parti-
cipants about slope satisfaction. Milakis and Athanasopoulos (2014)
consider the riding difficulty variable as a function of slope in a certain
section to understand cycling route preferences. Table 1 presents de-
tailed information on AST studies and others that take slope into ac-
count in their analysis. In this work, we focus on slope as the main
topographic condition in the city of Dresden, and seek to understand
how this variable influences transport choice in children and teenagers.

3. Case study

Dresden is located in the eastern part of Germany, close to the Czech
Republic (Fig. 1). It is the capital of the state of Saxony and a very
important cultural and educational hub in Germany (Dresden, 2018a).
Dresden is also acknowledged as one of the greenest cities in Europe
(Civitas, 2013); woods and green spaces account for 62% of the city's
territory. The city is located in a widening of the Elbe valley, sur-
rounded by the foothills of the Eastern Erzgebirge Mountains, the Lu-
satian Granite Uplands and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains (Dresden,
2018b). The length of the river within the city is about 30 km, and it is
crossed by ten bridges at different points. (See Fig. 2.)
According to the state's own statistics (Dresden, 2018b), Dresden's
population in 2005 was approximately 487,000, and now stands at
557,000 with a density of about 1696 inhabitants/km2. It is the fourth
largest city in Germany and has a total area of 328 km2. Built-up areas
and their associated open-spaces account for 6310 ha, while 3377 ha
are dedicated to traffic. The highest point (Triebenberg) is 383 m a.s.l.
and the lowest point (Cossebaude) is 101 m a.s.l.
The city's geographic location directly influences its particular
weather conditions. According to the weather statistics (Climate-Data,
2019; WetterKontor, 2018), the average temperatures are -1.8 °C in
January, and the maximum temperatures occur in July (19.8 °C). An-
nual precipitation is 667 mm.
Germany has a longstanding tradition of encouraging active and
independent mobility in children. According to the Children's
Independent Mobility Report (Shaw et al., 2015), German children
come second – after Finnish children – in their freedom to travel in-
dependently on local buses. An earlier study by Shaw et al. (2013)



Journal of Transport Geography 88 (2020) 102872


found that between 1990 and 2010, students attending secondary
school in Germany transitioned from walking and cycling to taking
public transport or school buses.
It should be noted that schoolchildren in Germany take a cycling
proficiency course and test before entering secondary school. This en-
courages independent mobility while emphasizing safe cycling at an
early age.
In the last decades, the mobility patterns of children have also
changed in Germany. Many children are being escorted, leading to a
decrease of AST.The German Ministry of Transport recently presented
the results of a study on family mobility (Manz et al., 2015). The study
by Scheiner (2016) reports that 16% of parental trips in Germany are
for the purpose of escorting children, increasing to 22% for families
escorting children aged ten or younger. Although this may be done by
private car in most cases, 22% of these trips involve active mobility,
while escorting children on public transport accounts for only 2% to 7%
of all cases, depending on the city type.
Germany has an established policy for school network planning
aimed at providing basic social infrastructure, known in German as
Daseinsvorsorge (Küpper, 2012), including a minimum access to certain
public services such as schools and transport (Gawron, 2008). In recent
years many towns and cities have seen a drop in the number of stu-
dents, leading to school closures. When a school closes, it has a direct
impact on the way students commute to the other available schools, and
on the transport services in the areas of both their former school and
their new schools. Various studies show how school closures trigger
changes in travel patterns (Haase and Müller, 2013; Müller et al., 2009;
Müller, 2011).

4. Methodology and data

This paper covers secondary schools with a focus on high academic
performance (Gymnasium in German) attended by students between 10
and 19 years old. Only a certain number of students may attend these
types of schools. At the time of the survey, around 45% of the students
in this age range went to a Gymnasium. Students who normally attend a
Gymnasium have higher grades and a better performance in elementary
school, while other students go to secondary schools known as
Mittelschule or Realschule, Hauptschule, Realschule and Gesamtschule. We
chose the Gymnasium because students show more variance in mode
choice compared to elementary and middle school. Younger students
often walk to school or are escorted by car. Few elementary or middle
school students choose public transport (Manz et al., 2015). There are
more middle schools than Gymnasium in Dresden, hence the average
commuting distances are shorter. Gymnasiums also offer specific
learning areas (school profiles) which impact the students' choice of
school (Müller et al., 2012), so longer commuting distances and a more
diverse mode choice pattern can be seen among Gymnasium students.
This paper uses the data from Müller et al. (2008) as the base model
choice. The data is available at GitHub.1 An analysis of the results re-
veals singularities in the case study that require further exploration.
From the literature review, we know that the built environment plays
an important role in the likelihood of riding a bike. In this study we
follow a comprehensive approach.
Different hypotheses are tested to improve the original model. First,
the predictive quality of the model can be enhanced by choice models
that explicitly allow for correlation among transport modes; and
second, the model can also be improved by considering the topography
of Dresden. We therefore present a methodology that takes account of
the “energy exerted” by cycling in the city of Dresden due to its hilly
profile. Third, we use age and gender as additional control variables.
The information collected in 2004 covered approximately 4700 of
the 14,000 school students at 12 out of the 23 schools in Dresden.

S. Müller, et al.


Although the data are over 15 years old, it is reasonable to assume that
the basic underlying patterns of mode choice have not changed sig-
nificantly since then. Most recent studies show the impact of distance
and weather. According to Manz et al. (2015), the mobility choices seen
in the information on secondary students' travel patterns in Germany
between 2002 and 2008 did not change noticeably. The same report
also shows that school closures have affected other secondary schools,
but not Gymnasiums, whose locations remain similar all over Germany.
However, the variance in more recent data may differ from our own, so
the alternative-specific constants of our model are likely to be biased.
Since this is only of interest in forecasting scenarios, we can disregard

this issue in this paper. More importantly, the topography and school
locations have not changed since then, and we are therefore convinced

our data are still valid for the purpose of our study.
It should be noted that due to data protection laws, students cannot

be asked their detailed whereabouts such as their home address, which

made it necessary to design a methodology to obtain a proxy for their

place of residence and route. Other authors mention data protection

laws as a drawback (Stark et al., 2018c), which has also been cir-
cumvented by using an alternative approach (Scheiner, 2016).
The students were asked to specify the closest bus stop and the es-

timated walking time from home to the bus stop. We also had small-

scale demographic data at the block level (smallest administrative

census units in Dresden). Using this information, we built an isochrone

around the bus stop for each student, so each isochrone might be fea-

sible for several students. We then assigned the census blocks inter-

secting an isochrone to that same isochrone. All the students in an
isochrone were distributed to each block in line with the frequency in

the census of individuals aged between 10 and 19. Using a shortest-path

algorithm, we were able to determine the street network distances be-
tween all the blocks in Dresden. These had to be interpreted as walking
distances in the absence of information about car accessibility around
one-way street systems. As this paper considers only the commute to
school, cars and motorcycles did not play an important role. Detailed
information on this methodological approach can be found in Müller
et al. (2008).


4.1. Topographical analysis and its transformation in energy

This study considers Dresden's topographic profile. There are major

differences in elevation across the city. For example, the Klotzsche
District is 227 m above sea level, whereas the inner city is only 112 m
above (see Fig. 3). To improve the model, topographical patterns are

used to obtain the energy required by students on their individual
commuting trip to school when they cycle.
We use a digital terrain model with the exact topographic

information for the area of Dresden (Federal Office of Cartography and
Geodesy (BKG) (bkg, 2018)) to obtain a height profile for the commute
to school on the shortest path for each student in our sample. To cal-
culate the expected energy expended by a cycling student, we consider
En = Fn· vn.                                                                        (1)

The exogenous variable, power (En), is formed of force Fn and speed
vn, according to Gressmann (2005)
Fn = F roll Fndrag Fnslope                                                          (2)

The rolling friction      Fnroll
is derived from the contact of the tyre with
the surface. It is calculated as
m
F roll = 0.0058 9.81     (15kg + 65kg)
s                                                            (3)

which is the product of a given constant, gravity, and the weight of

the systems (i.e., the sum of the weight of the student and the bike). Due

to lack of data, we assume an average student weighs 65 kg and a bike is

about 15 kg. The drag

Fndrag = 0.5 c A       vn2                                                          (4)

comprises a drag coefficient c = 1.1, air density <U+03C1> =1.25 kg/m3,

and the squared speed of student n. Due to lack of data, we assume the

surface area (A) of a student to be 0.42m2. We subdivide the route

length of student n from home to school into sections kn. Each section kn

is distinctly characterized by either positive, negative or zero slope. The

topography is considered in the friction due to slope

m                            Hkn      Hk + 1n
Fnslope = 9.81     (15kg + 65kg)
s                       kn
D kn                            (5)

where Hknis the height of knin metres above sea level and Dknis the
length of knin metres (see Fig. 3 for some numerical examples of how
Fnslopeis computed). Since the topography differs between the route to
and from school, we consider Fnslope1for the route to school and Fnslope2
for the route back home.
To determine speed vn, we use the GoogleMaps API (Googlemaps,
2015), which allows us to query the distance travelled on the shortest
path and the expected travel time depending on the topography
(Fig. 4). We then calculate the expected speed on the shortest path from
student's home n to school vn1and back vn2. So (2) is rewritten as

dataset also contains information about the distance in kilometres from
a student's home to school by the shortest path. We use the “season”
variable to consider the impact of weather conditions on the mode

choice, since many people in Germany alter their travel behaviour de-


pending on the season and weather conditions, as in many other cities
with adverse meteorological conditions (Amiri and Sadeghpour, 2015).
The survey contains two questions regarding the commute-to-school
mode choice: one for winter and one for summer. As can be clearly seen
in Table 1, there is a significant difference in bike share between
summer and winter, as expected. Our control variables are the students'

age, class and gender, and whether a car is always available or not. The
descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2. For further details, see
Müller et al. (2008).

5. Mode choice model specification

We assume that student n chooses exactly one main commuting
mode i from a given choice set {walk, bike, public transport, car}.
Choosing alternative i yields utility

with Vni representing the deterministic part of the derived utility,
and <U+03F5>ni the stochastic part. The deterministic utility is defined as

Vni =            Xnim
im
(9)
m

The exogenous variables Xnim are age, distance, energy En, etc. The
coefficients ßim represent the marginal contribution to utility and are
estimated via maximum likelihood. We further assume that student n
chooses the alternative i that maximizes her utility:

Uni > Vnj        j   i                                                              (10)

Since utility (8) is a stochastic quantity, we can only make prob-
ability statements about (10); i.e., the probability that n chooses i is:
Pni = Prob (Uni > Vnj           j   i)                                              (11)

If we now assume that <U+03F5>ni is an identically and independently dis-
tributed (IID) extreme value, then (11) becomes the multinomial logit
model (MNL):
eVni
Pni =
(8)                  j
eVnj                                                                      (12)

The MNL model (12) exhibits the property known as independence
from irrelevant alternatives (IIA), which states that every alternative j is
an equal substitute to i. Technically speaking, by using the MNL we
assume there is no correlation between the alternative modes, although
we can easily find situations that violate this assumption. For instance,
the alternatives “walk” and “bike” might both be sensitive to the
weather and therefore share some unobserved effects, which could in
turn cause correlations between “walk” and “bike” that are neglected
by the MNL. We use the McFadden omitted variables test to verify
whether the IIA assumption holds or not. If the assumption does not
hold, we must make different assumptions about the distribution of <U+03F5>ni.
Here we assume <U+03F5>ni to be a multivariate extreme value distribution.
Thus from (11) we obtain the nested logit model (NL):
µ


Pni =
e µs Vni        (     j Bs
e µs Vnj   )   µs

µ
e µs Vnj
j Bs             S
t=1   (   j Bt
e µt Vni        )   µt
(13)

where (13) is the choice probability of alternative i in nest Bt. We
partition the choice set into S nonoverlapping subsets denoted B1, B2,
…, BS and call them nests from hereon. The parameter µs is a measure of
the degree of independence in unobserved utility among the alter-
natives in nest s. Scale parameter µ is normalized to 1. The NL exhibits
the following properties:

1. For any two alternatives that are in the same nest, the ratio of
probabilities is independent of the attributes or existence of all other
alternatives. That is, the IIA property holds within each nest.
2. For any two alternatives in different nests, the ratio of probabilities
can depend on the attributes of other alternatives in the two nests.
IIA does not hold in general for alternatives in different nests.

The assignment of alternatives to nests is arbitrary. We test the nest
specifications shown in Fig. 5. We understand that walk and bike may
have unobservable sources of correlation (as AST modes) and we
therefore test different alternatives to improve the model. We also test
whether car and public transport (PuTr) – as non-active transportation
–, and the environmentally friendly choice of PuTr, bike and walking,
share unobserved characteristics. Fig. 5 shows the models tested in this
study.

6. Results

Table 3 contains the respective estimated coefficients im and other

parameters within the base model and the nested models. For com-

parison we added a MNL specification. We tested different MNL spe-

cifications (see Table A1 in the appendix) and decided to maintain the

one in Table 3. As expected, we found a decline in utility with distance

between students' home and school. The slope is steeper for non-mo-

torized modes than for motorized modes. Car availability increases the

likelihood of commuting by car, and winter particularly decreases the

utility of walk and bike. These results are in line with the findings of

Müller et al. (2008).

However, this study adds to these findings by using a gender

dummy, an age (or rather class) variable, an interaction between dis-

tance and season, and of course our energy variable. Interestingly, we

found that female students are less likely than male students to choose

bike, while gender has no impact on the other commuting modes.

The class variable reveals that higher classes are more likely to

choose “parent-independent” commuting modes, and the utility of cy-

cling specifically increases with class. We assume that older students

are more likely to be allowed to take “riskier” or more independent

modes rather than being driven by their parents, which can be seen as a

sign of the students' growing independence. The interaction between

distance and season reveals some interesting insights. The magnitude of

the distance slope for walk and public transport declines in winter

compared to bike and car, showing that students are more willing to

walk longer distances in winter than in summer. We can assume that it

is more convenient for students to walk in snow or rain than taking the

bike (an umbrella can be used while walking, for instance).

As expected, the energy consumption on the commute to school by

bike reduces the bike utility. Specifically, for one unit increase in the

energy variable we expect a exp.(-0.188) = 0.83; i.e., a 17% decrease

in the odds of choosing bike assuming MNL.

The nominal explanatory power of nested models 2 and 3 is very

similar. The nest parameters non-active transportation, and active trans-

portation are not statistically significant for nest structure 1. The nest

coefficients do not support utility maximization theory as they are

larger than one. The ratio of the significant alternative variables com-

pared to the initial model also decreases from 78% to 46%. Above all,

the significance of the vehicle availability variable drops sharply when

using the nest structure compared with the base model.

In the nested logit model 2, the nest environmentally friendly is sta-

tistically significant. The distance variable for the public transport al-

ternative is also significant. Within Nest B, the increased system speed

of public transport is stronger than non-motorized transport. The IIA

property may be violated because more than two alternatives belong to

Nest B. For this reason, a McFadden omitted variable test was

conducted for the alternatives public transport, bicycle, and walking. The
inaccuracies in the unobserved characteristics between bicycle and
walking and between all three alternatives in the nest increased in re-
lation to the initial model. A third nest structure was therefore eval-
uated to determine whether it might be a better alternative.
The additional sub-nest proposed in nested model 3 minimizes the
likelihood ratio value compared to the other models. The significance
values of the variables also change minimally. At a significance level of
95%, the network parameter active mobility is not significant. We prefer
the Nested 2 or Nested 3 specification due to their significance, con-
formity with utility theory and complexity.

Table 4 presents different statistical measures, known as the clas-
sification function. Although these values must be carefully analysed,
they provide good information on the reliability of the different models.
We analyse two situations, one for summer and one for winter. For the
basic model, the Nested 3 model presents better explanatory results for
the walking and bike alternatives. The number of students using mo-
torized traffic is 40% lower than in the original model. 95% of this
decline comes from the drop in the number of public transport users.
Only 61% of all car and public transport users are correctly assigned in
the nested logit model, while 89% of public transport users and 76% of
motorists are still correctly calculated in the initial model. The rate of

correct assignment decreases with each level of the nested logit model.
At level 1 (car/non-environmentally-friendly vs. environmentally
friendly), 94% of all allocations are still correct, while only 81% are
correct at level 2 (PuTr/non-active vs. active transport).
Fig. 6 presents the results, and shows the difference between the
alternatives bicycle and public transport in the base model (left) and
nested logit 3 (right). The alternative bike has increased the overall
probability values. For both models, the distance is about two kilo-
metres. It is worth noting that the selection probability of the NL model
remains above zero over a wider distance interval than in the initial
model. The alternative public transport is complementary. Assuming that
no vehicle is available, the probability of selecting the base model for
the alternative public transport from a distance of more than five kilo-
metres is close to 100%. In the case of Nested 3 model, such a high level
of probability of choosing public transport is valid only between five
and ten kilometres, depending on the energy expenditure. The greater
influence of the energy variable in the NL model can also be seen in the
same figure.
The energy variable only affects the cycling alternative, so an in-
crease in the probability of the public transport (PuTr) alternative, with
increasing energy consumption, negatively influences the benefits of
the cycling alternative.
Car availability mainly affects the decision in the first nest level.
Fig. 6b shows the probability of selecting the two environmentally-
friendly nests at the first decision-making level (top of the figure) and
active transportation at the second level (at the bottom of Fig. 6b), each
without (left) and with (right) individual vehicle availability. Clearly,
when a vehicle is not available, 99-100% choose an alternative in the
environmentally friendly nest, whereas when it is, this figure is between
50 and 100%. The probability depends mainly on the distance. In the
lower decision-making level, the choice between the active transporta-
tion nest and the non-active alternative (in other words, public transport),
vehicle availability is almost non-existent. These results confirm the
logical correctness of the nested approach.

7. Conclusions and final discussion

This paper seeks to understand the mobility patterns of children and
teenagers on their travel choice to school and to discuss measures to
improve sustainable mobility in a hilly urban environment. It uses a
wide variety of models, only three of which are presented here. These
models slightly improve the base model, although all offer a very good
level of explanation. However, the nested logit structures circumvent
the violation of the IIA property in the initial model.
Active transportation is clearly sensitive to different characteristics
of the urban environment such as changes in topography. This study
identifies that the energy exerted in overcoming differences in level is a
significant parameter. More specifically, the energy variable, which
describes the effort made by students when cycling to school while
considering the topographic differences during the whole trip, improves
the results. A failure to take into account the energy expenditure in hilly
environments evidently produces misleading results.
In terms of policy implications, this study sheds new light on the
analysis of active transportation. One significant measure for promoting
AST is the cycling proficiency test for students in Germany, but other
alternatives such as “walking buses” should be promoted for younger
students. Hilly environments undoubtedly play a role in the choice of a
certain transport mode; a similar analysis is therefore recommended for

bike-sharing systems to ensure realistic results. This type of analysis
could be used to inform city planners about better locations for docking
stations in hilly urban environments, taking into account the topo-
graphic conditions and making the relocation of bicycles more efficient
as a result.
As highlighted in the literature review, a dense and equitable school
network positively influences AST. In contrast, a school's closing may
affect students' modal choice, as they are forced to change their travel
patterns according to the location of their new school, in many cases by
using less environmentally friendly modal choices. This discussion
needs to be part of a fairer social infrastructure planning
(“Daseinsvorsorge”). Disadvantages in transport may increase the like-
lihood of people moving away from sparsely populated areas, thus
further increasing their unattractiveness and leading to higher social
costs.
It is important for the city to favour transport policies that promote
environmentally friendly modal choices for students, and particularly
choices that support active transportation to schools. The models show
that environmentally and non-environmentally friendly alternatives are
being considered when making a decision. AST has traditionally en-
joyed positive support in German society, so public authorities should
increase the measures to promote it. Special attention should be paid to
policies that support female AST, since this paper shows that gender
plays a role in the choice of bike for commuting; the reasons for this
require further analysis. It is also necessary to provide support for en-
vironmentally friendly modes and especially for active transportation,
even if children are escorted to school.
This study also opens up many avenues for further research: for
example, a comparative study of other areas with important topo-
graphic changes, as in this case study; testing other detailed spatial
characteristics of the urban environment and school transport policy
concepts; the factors underlying gender and AST shares, detailed
weather information, or a new survey to understand the changes in
mobility choices in the same city in light of the new mobility alter-
natives. It would help to include other important information from
students and their families, such as socio-cultural and economic char-
acteristics. Finally, Pedelecs (pedal electric cycle) are becoming in-
creasingly popular among various sectors of the population in
Germany, and their use is being widely promoted by different autho-
rities (RadKULTUR BW, 2019). Given the results, and in light of the
new micro-mobility alternatives and citizens' greater environmental
concern, the perception and acceptability of e-mobility assistance in
hilly environments could be further explored among different popula-
tion groups such as escorting parents in different areas of Germany.
