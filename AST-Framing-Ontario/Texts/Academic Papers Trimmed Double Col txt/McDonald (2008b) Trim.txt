Abstract
    This study evaluates how household interactions a<U+FB00>ect walking and biking to school. The cross-sectional research design uses a rep-
resentative sample of trips to school by US youth (n = 8231) to test how parental employment status and commute patterns a<U+FB00>ect non-
motorized travel. Results from a binary logit model show that young children (5–14) with mothers who commute to work in the morning
are less likely to walk or bike to school after controlling for individual, household, and neighborhood factors. Policymakers may there-
fore want to create programs that allow parents to share chaperoning responsibilities for the school trip to address parental time
constraints.
