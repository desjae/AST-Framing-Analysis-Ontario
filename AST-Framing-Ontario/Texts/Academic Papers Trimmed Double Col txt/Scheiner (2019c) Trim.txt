pavements along the route increase the odds of being driven rather than walking. Secondly, tra<U+FB03>c calming is
associated with higher odds of cycling against walking. Parental attitudes and concerns also play a signi<U+FB01>cant
role in child mode choice.




1. Introduction                                                                                     Children's travel has substantially changed over the past decades,
the most striking changes being probably the shift from active modes,
Children's travel to and from school has been the subject of research                       especially walking, to being driven by car, and the associated decline in
since the 1970s (Rigby, 1979, see for a comprehensive review of early                           independent travel (McDonald, 2007, for the US; Shaw et al., 2013 for

increasing debate in the general media about problems associated with                           and target variables. Two basic distinctions can be made. Firstly, a large

studies often have their roots in cultural sciences.
Neither of these two distinctions is a subgroup of the other.
Qualitative as well as quantitative studies may pay attention to parents'
and/or children's travel. Nor is either of the two distinctions exclusive;
rather there is overlap to some extent, although the majority of studies
can still be clearly located in one <U+FB01>eld. Table 1 gives some examples.
This paper uses standardised data collected in 2017 in a ques-
tionnaire survey in the mid-sized suburban town of Lünen, Germany. It
studies children's mode use on the trip to primary school and back
home. Hence, the paper can be <U+FB01>led in the upper left-hand <U+FB01>eld of the
table. The study was motivated by the observation that there is a
striking lack of research on the topic in Germany. This is despite the
early contribution of Germany to research about child mobility
(Hillman et al., 1990). More speci<U+FB01>cally, to the best of our knowledge
this is the <U+FB01>rst study from Germany that investigates child mode use
using multivariate methods to simultaneously include multiple factors
(see Scheiner, 2016, for a study on children's independent travel).
Hence, this paper asks for sociodemographic, attitudinal and environ-
mental factors that may a<U+FB00>ect children's trips to school in Germany.
The next section provides a brief overview of literature on children's
mode use. Section 3 introduces data and methods, and Section 4 pre-
sents the results. The paper concludes with a summary and draws
conclusions for policy and research.


2. Background – children's mode use

Research on child travel has matured to the extent that literature
reviews have been conducted for various sub-<U+FB01>elds including children's
mode use (Rojas Lopez and Wong, 2017; Rothman et al., in print), in-
dependent mobility (Sharmin and Kamruzzaman, 2017), environmental
factors that a<U+FB00>ect the use of active modes (Pont et al, 2009; D'Haese
et al., 2015), interventions to promote active travel (Smith et al., 2015;
Pang et al., 2017; Larouche et al., 2018), associations between child
travel and child health status (Schoeppe et al., 2013), methods of
capturing children's independent mobility (Bates and Stone, 2015), and
children's mobility/school travel in general (McDonald, 2005;
McMillan, 2005; Curtis et al., 2015). This also includes multiple review
sections in empirical studies on mode use (Wilson et al., 2010; Zhang
et al., 2017; Hatamzadeh et al., 2017) or independent mobility (Shaw
et al., 2013; Kyttä et al., 2015; Buliung et al., 2017).
Hence, this section focuses – though not exclusively – on studies of
mode use employing standardised data that have been published in the
past few years. There is, however, much overlap between studies of
mode use and studies of independent mobility. In strongly car-based
environments independent mobility coincides largely, though not
strictly, with the use of active modes (Carver et al., 2014, for Australia;
Hsu and Saphores, 2014, 550 for California), while in less car-based
environments parents may accompany their children on foot or by bi-
cycle (Scheiner, 2016, for Germany; Buliung et al., 2017, for Toronto).
The literature on children's independent mobility is somewhat di<U+FB00>erent
from the mode use literature as the latter tends to use measures of
realised travel, while the former is often based on surveys asking for
‘mobility licences’, i.e. parental allowances for travelling or being
outside without supervision (Hillman et al., 1990; see Kyttä et al., 2015,
and Schoeppe et al., 2016 for the use of both types of measures). Fur-
ther, it should be noted that most studies focus on school travel, while


Travel Behaviour and Society 15 (2019) 15–27


there is less research on other trip purposes (see for a comparison be-
tween the two, Stark et al., 2018).
One needs to point out that children's mode use is not necessarily a
preferential choice as it is for adults. Children, particularly at younger
ages, are largely dependent on their parents' choices though they de-

velop strategies to resist and strive for autonomy (Barron, 2014).


Hence, their travel is constrained by parental considerations, daily
needs, resources, attitudes and fears. Generally, children's mode use
may be understood in the context of seven dimensions that can be
modelled using a large number of variables: (1) trip characteristics, (2)
child characteristics, (3) the household context, (4) subjective concerns,
attitudes and perceptions, (5) the transport environment, (6) the built
environment and (7) the social environment.

2.1. Trip characteristics

Studies consistently report that longer distances to school are as-
sociated with less active (non-motorised) travel (Wilson et al., 2010;
Hsu and Saphores, 2014; all for the US; Mitra and Buliung, 2012; Mitra
and Faulkner, 2012; Stone et al., 2014; Rothman et al., 2015; Guliani
et al., 2015; Mitra et al., 2016; and Larsen et al., 2016, for Toronto,
Canada; Clark et al., 2016; and Ahern et al. 2016 for the UK;
Hatamzadeh et al., 2017, for Iran; Zhang et al., 2017; and Jing et al.,
2017, for China; Helbich, 2017, for the Netherlands; Mehdizadeh et al.,
2017, for Iran; van Goeverden and de Boer, 2013, for the Netherlands
and Flanders; Easton and Ferrari, 2015, for She<U+FB03>eld, UK; Waygood and
Susilo, 2015, for Scotland; Moran et al., 2016, for Israel; Stark et al.,
2018, for Austria). Thresholds for the acceptance of active travel may
vary with cultural norms or constraints set by the environment (see
Waygood and Susilo, 2011, for a comparison between Japan and the
UK; van Goeverden and de Boer, 2013, for the Netherlands and Flan-
ders). In Germany, two thresholds can be identi<U+FB01>ed. The share of pri-
mary school children walking drops from 85% to about 60% when the
distance to school is longer than 600 m, and to 34% at a distance of
1.2 km. The share of the bicycle has its maximum in the range from 1.2
to 2.0 km (14%) (Mobilität in Deutschland, own analysis, unpublished).
Over and above distance, mode choice is a<U+FB00>ected by topography
(slope) along the route (Lin and Chang, 2010, for independent travel)
and climatic or (more short-term) weather variations (van Goeverden
and de Boer, 2013; Oxford and Pollock, 2015; Kamargianni et al.,
2015). Mitra and Faulkner (2012) do not <U+FB01>nd signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects of
(weekly) weather conditions on mode choice.
The homebound trip from school is more often conducted in-
dependently of parents than the morning trip to school, and this is as-
sociated with less car travel (Lin and Chang 2010, for Taiwan;
Schlossberg et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2010; and McDonald and
Aalborg, 2009, for the US). This may re<U+FB02>ect parental work schedules
and safety considerations which preclude parents from letting their
children walk in the rush hour or on dark winter mornings.

2.2. Child characteristics

Children become more independent as they grow up. Hence, age has
been found to be one of the most important factors to explain children's
mode use, as can also be seen in e<U+FB00>ects of school stages that re<U+FB02>ect age
(Zhang et al., 2017). The probability of walking or cycling to school
increases with age (Wilson et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2011; Helbich,
2017), and the same has been found to be true for using public trans-
port (Wilson et al., 2010), while the probability of being driven de-
creases (Wilson et al., 2010; van Goeverden and de Boer, 2013; see He
and Giuliano, 2017, for a joint mode and escort model). Conversely,
Easton and Ferrari (2015) <U+FB01>nd that teenagers are less likely to walk to
school than younger children, once distance is taken into account, and
rather use motorised modes. Pabayo et al. (2011) and Manz et al.
(2015) also <U+FB01>nd that from the age of ten walking decreases and, hence,
forms a bell-shaped age curve.

J. Scheiner et al.


Environmental conditions may mediate age e<U+FB00>ects. Lopes et al.
(2014) <U+FB01>nd that children in highly urbanised environments in Portugal
are allowed to be independently mobile only at a greater age than those
living in more rural environments. Scheiner (2016) con<U+FB01>rms this for
Germany, but adds that older children tend to be escorted less often by
their parents in cities.
Boys use active modes and the bus more often than girls (Mitra and
Faulkner, 2012; Stone et al., 2014; Guliani et al., 2015; Easton and
Ferrari, 2015; Larsen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Jing et al., 2017),
and they are driven less often (van Goeverden and de Boer, 2013, for
the Netherlands and Flanders) which is probably due to parental con-
cerns about harassment and the vulnerability of girls (Zhang et al.,
2017). Other studies <U+FB01>nd no signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects of gender on mode
choice (Helbich, 2017; Frater et al., 2017, for the intention to cycle) or
independent travel (He, 2013).

2.3. The household context

The family in which a child lives a<U+FB00>ects the child's mode use in a
myriad of ways. These include more objective factors such as household
and parental resources, needs, activity patterns, the existence, gender
and age of siblings, and their school trips, as well as subjective parental
attitudes, concerns and fears. These factors may intersect in multiple
and complex ways. For instance, parents may be inclined to let their 7-
year-old son walk to school without parental escort as long as the elder
daughter takes the same route. The elder daughter, however, may
prefer to walk with her friends rather than looking after her younger
brother. Finally, the father may take the son to school by car and drop
him o<U+FB00> on the trip to work. The interactions between household
members have been studied by Ermagun and Levinson (2016) using a
group decision making approach that captures intra-household bar-
gaining.
Various studies found that children living in high-status households
are less likely to use public transport (Wilson et al., 2010, for the US;
Ermagun and Samimi, 2015, for Iran; Zhang et al., 2017 for China), less
likely to use active modes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017, for Iran), and more
likely to be driven (Zhang et al., 2017) and travel less independently
(Yoon et al., 2011; Pabayo et al., 2012; He, 2013; Hsu and Saphores,
2014). Socioeconomic status is re<U+FB02>ected in various variables in these
studies, such as income, parental education, or home ownership. There
is no ultimate theoretical mechanism to explain this. Privileged
households may be more protective (Yoon et al., 2011; Kamargianni
et al., 2015), or they may live more distant from the school, e.g. because
parents are more likely to choose the ‘best’ school for their children
(rather than the nearest), if the school system allows this (e.g.,
Andersson et al., 2012, for Sweden). High-status households are also
more likely to include two employed parents and have multiple cars,
which facilitates dropping a child o<U+FB00> at school on the commute, as long
as the work schedule is <U+FB02>exible or <U+FB01>ts school start time (and location)
(Oxford and Pollock, 2015; Zhang et al., 2017). On the other hand, time
constraints are more severe when both parents are in full-time em-
ployment. Parents being ‘unavailable’ early in the morning due to their
own work schedules may motivate their child to walk alone (Mitra and
Buliung, 2012). Mothers with longer working hours and/or longer
commutes are less likely to escort their children, resulting in an in-
creased probability of alternative options (He and Giuliano, 2017),
while <U+FB02>exible work schedules may increase the propensity of escorting
their child (Buliung et al., 2017; He and Giuliano, 2017). Carver et al.
(2013) <U+FB01>nd that in Australia the likelihood for a child to be driven home
from school increases when at least one parent is not employed full-
time (and, hence, may have the option to pick up the child).
Household car ownership is a key resource for travel that may op-
erate over and above its link to social status. It has consistently been
found to increase the chance of being driven (van Goeverden and de
Boer, 2013; Zhang et al., 2017) at the expense of active modes (Mitra
and Faulkner, 2012, Guliani et al., 2015; Rothman et al., 2015;


Travel Behaviour and Society 15 (2019) 15–27


Waygood and Susilo, 2015; Mitra et al., 2016; Moran et al., 2016;
Mehdizadeh et al., 2017; Stark et al., 2018).
Household composition may be important in various ways. Single
parents may have less chance to escort their children due to time
constraints (He and Giuliano, 2017). Pabayo et al. (2012) report that
having an older sibling increases the likelihood of active travel, as joint
travel with older siblings may reduce parental fear. On the other hand,
having to drop o<U+FB00> another child at the same or another school along the
route may increase the chance that the sibling child is driven (Stone
et al., 2014; Oxford and Pollock, 2015).
Parents' general travel behaviour also a<U+FB00>ects children's travel.
Henne et al. (2014), Susilo and Liu (2016) and Jing et al. (2017) <U+FB01>nd a
positive association between parents' and their children's use of active
modes. This may contribute to longer-term mobility biographies.

2.4. Subjective concerns and attitudes

Safety and security concerns may lead to more parental escort
(Alparone and Pacilli, 2012; Hsu and Saphores, 2014; Waygood and
Susilo, 2015) and have been found to reduce cycling as well as walking
among children (Guliani et al., 2015; Rothman et al., 2015;
Kamargianni et al., 2015; Curtis et al., 2015; Moran et al., 2016).
Parental or children's fears may refer to tra<U+FB03>c safety or security from
crime and harassment (‘stranger danger’). Parental concerns, however,
are themselves to some extent a function of the environment (Evers
et al., 2014; Guliani et al., 2015). For instance, heavy tra<U+FB03>c levels may
encourage parents to protect their child, thus preventing the child from
developing travel competence, which in turn may lead to a negative
parental perception of the child's competence (Hüttenmoser, 1995). The
interrelations between subjective perceptions and the actual environ-
ment may lead to unexpected results, which are not easy to interpret.
For instance, Waygood and Susilo (2015) <U+FB01>nd that the parental per-
ception that tra<U+FB03>c is slow and safe has a negative e<U+FB00>ect on the prob-
ability that their child walks to school. They suggest that this percep-
tion ‘may be associated with neighbourhoods that have low congestion,
thus making it easier for the parent to drive their child’ (Waygood and
Susilo, 2015, 128).
Another dimension of parental attitudes is that driving is perceived
to be convenient and fast (McDonald and Aalborg, 2009; Stone et al.,
2014), and a welcome opportunity for parents to spend time with their
child (Carver et al., 2013). Parental pressure based on their mode at-
titudes has been found to a<U+FB00>ect adolescents' willingness to cycle to
school (Stone et al., 2014; Frater et al., 2017). What is more, parental
mode habits have been found to exhibit a strong impact on child mode
use in China (Jing et al., 2017).

2.5. The transport environment

High tra<U+FB03>c density, high speed levels, wide streets, a lack of pa-
vements, the need to cross (major) intersections and, more generally,
stress resulting from motorised tra<U+FB03>c on the trip to school may prevent
parents from allowing their children to walk or cycle independently
(Stone et al., 2014; Rothman et al., 2015; Ahern et al. 2016; Larsen
et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; see Ghekiere et al., 2018, for an ex-
perimental study of the tra<U+FB03>c and infrastructure design factors that
increase parents' willingness to let their children cycle). Conversely,
factors such as the existence of pavements and/or bicycle paths, tra<U+FB03>c
calming measures, good road connectivity and the existence of short-
cuts have been reported to positively a<U+FB00>ect walking and/or cycling
(Noland et al., 2012; Stone et al., 2014, Guliani et al., 2015;
Kamargianni et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2016). On the other hand,
Helbich (2017) <U+FB01>nds no signi<U+FB01>cant associations between objective
tra<U+FB03>c safety and mode choice to school in the Netherlands, which may
be due to the omnipresence of bike lanes and pavements.
It is often di<U+FB03>cult to draw consistent conclusions from the multi-
tude of attributes of the transport network and their possible e<U+FB00>ects. For

17

J. Scheiner et al.


instance, Guliani et al. (2015) <U+FB01>nd that the need to cross major roads
increases the likelihood of walking. This sounds counterintuitive as the
need to cross intersections should increase parental safety concerns
(e.g., Stone et al., 2014). The authors suggest that the presence of major
intersections may represent good connectivity in the road network
which may in turn increase active and independent travel (similarly:
Schlossberg et al., 2006).

2.6. The built environment

More general measures of urbanity, such as population density,
land-use diversity, city population size and a generally urban (as op-
posed to suburban or rural) location encourage active and independent
travel (van Goeverden and de Boer, 2013; Hsu and Saphores, 2014;
Curtis et al., 2015; Waygood and Susilo, 2015; Mitra et al., 2016). On
the other hand, urbanity is typically associated with parental tra<U+FB03>c
safety and security concerns (Lopes et al., 2014) and, hence, results on
the role of the built environment are not fully consistent (see Kyttä et al.
2015, for discussion). Inconclusive results may also be due to simpli<U+FB01>ed
coding of modes (e.g. mashing up walking and cycling into active
modes) and/or purposes. For instance, Moran et al. (2016) <U+FB01>nd that
density encourages walking to school in Israel, but discourages cycling
to neighbourhood destinations or for leisure purposes. Helbich (2017)
supports the separate treatment of walking and cycling.

2.7. The social environment

Intra-neighbourhood social interaction may a<U+FB00>ect mode use, e.g.
children are more likely to walk to school in neighbourhoods where
other people walk. This may re<U+FB02>ect a sense of pedestrian safety or a
collectively shared walking culture. Neighbourhood social capital, so-
cial trust or a sense of community may also motivate parents to not
drive their children on short trips (McDonald, 2007; Alparone and
Pacilli, 2012; Carver et al., 2013; Lopes et al., 2014; Kyttä et al., 2015).
Conversely, walking may increase the chance for a child to see friends
or other known people on the trip and, thus, increase incidental com-
munity connections (Waygood and Friman, 2015). Social pressure by
peers has been found to strongly a<U+FB00>ect adolescents' willingness to cycle
to school (Frater et al., 2017).
Taken overall, a rich array of factors that contribute to under-
standing children's mode choice to school have been studied, though
there is arguably no single study that integrates all the relevant factors
in a comprehensive way. Additionally, there are inconsistencies be-
tween <U+FB01>ndings in various studies, and between <U+FB01>ndings and their in-
terpretation. For Germany, this is the <U+FB01>rst study that simultaneously
models associations between children's mode choice on the school trip
and a large number of variables that re<U+FB02>ect all the dimensions discussed
above.

3. Data and method

3.1. Survey and study site

The data used for this paper were collected in January 2017 in a
questionnaire survey. Parents of children in one of seven primary
schools (forms 1–4, age 6–10, out of a total of 14 primary schools) in
Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, were asked to complete a ques-
tionnaire that was distributed via teachers in the classrooms and col-
lected a week later (with a second round of collection two weeks later
to account for late responses). All children in the seven schools
(n = 1763) received a questionnaire. Separated parents were informed
that the questionnaire should be completed by the parent where the
child spends most of his/her time on schooldays. A response rate of 60.3
percent resulted in n = 1064 completed questionnaires. This unusually
large response rate testi<U+FB01>es to the strong motivation of schools and
parents to support studies of school trips (as can also be seen from


Travel Behaviour and Society 15 (2019) 15–27


parental comments written on the questionnaires).
Lünen is a medium-sized town located at the border between the
metropolitan Ruhr area and the more rural Münsterland. It has a dis-
tinct suburban character, and it can be considered a somewhat typical
representation of mid-to-late 20th century developments in low-to-
middle-class regions.
The weather at the time of survey was cool but sunny and dry (no
snow), with daytime temperatures slightly exceeding the freezing point.
The following information was collected:

• the child's trip to and from school: usual mode in the week prior to
the survey and in summertime, accompanying persons (separate for
outward and return trip, respectively), reasons for accompaniment,
distance to school
•   child sociodemographics: age, gender, school form
•   household sociodemographics: household type, age of other chil-
dren in the household, household income, the respondent's and his/
her partner's age, gender, nationality, education level (school and
job training), employment situation
•   travel behaviour of the responding parent and her/his partner: li-
cense possession, number of cars, mode choice to work (or educa-
tion, if applicable),
•   the responding parent's attitudes and concerns about safety, se-
curity, the social environment, and the transport environment on
the trip to school. This included 20 items that captured the level of
trust in other tra<U+FB03>c participants, neighbourhood trust, trust into the
capabilities of the child, fears related to the child when (s)he is
outside, and seven items related to perceived transport infra-
structure design and tra<U+FB03>c dangers on the route to school
•   the responding parent's attitudes about gender role worksharing in
the household (four items)
•   the household residential address.

Privacy concerns led to a questionnaire instruction explicitly stating
that information on the home address and household income was not
mandatory (though this is a matter of course). We received full in-
formation for regression modelling in 581 cases (morning trip) and 576
cases (afternoon trip), with 477 respondents omitting the income
question, and 385 respondents omitting their address. The net sample
of n = 576 still re<U+FB02>ects a good response rate of 33 percent of the gross
(n = 1763).

3.2. The transport and built environment

The survey data were matched with detailed information that was
extracted from digital sources and collected on site in August 2017.
Route information was collected for the shortest walking route in-
cluding paths and tracks suitable only for non-motorised transport.
These formal or informal shortcuts (see Clark et al., 2016) were de-
tected manually on site.
The geodata used includes information on speed limits, the classi-
<U+FB01>cation of roads, pavement designs, pedestrian crossing facilities,
parking regulations, right-of-way regulations at intersections, land-use
along the trip, and tra<U+FB03>c safety. The survey of parking regulations was
limited to intersections where it is most likely that parked vehicles
restrict the view for crossing pedestrians. Information on tra<U+FB03>c loads
was not available, but it can be assumed that the classi<U+FB01>cation of a road
is strongly associated with tra<U+FB03>c loads. Similarly, industry and trade
areas taken from the detailed on-site survey are associated with heavy
tra<U+FB03>c loads. Various kinds of artifacts (plants, street furniture, vehicles
etc.), some of them temporary, restrict the view at road crossings. An
attempt to reduce bias was made by surveying only on weekdays during
working hours. Still, the variables may include arbitrary information.
This vast amount of information was used in two di<U+FB00>erent ways.
Most research in the <U+FB01>eld relies heavily on 'variable approaches', i.e. the
e<U+FB00>ects of a number of separate variables on child travel are estimated

18

J. Scheiner et al.


simultaneously. As many geographical variables correlate with each
other, this procedure may mask interactions between the variables, i.e.
it does not provide a holistic picture of a route. On the other hand,
working with ‘holistic’ variables that capture the ‘total’ of a route does
not allow a detailed examination of the e<U+FB00>ects of certain land-use or
road attributes.
We therefore use ha combined approach. We assume that two issues
are particularly relevant for parental concern: the need to cross roads
and/or walk along insu<U+FB03>cient pavements, and tra<U+FB03>c safety. The latter
is particularly true in small or medium-sized towns where people may
recall severe accidents including the places where they occurred.
Therefore, we work with original measures here, while we reduce other
geographical variables in a principal component analysis to account for
the general character of the route.

3.2.1. Tra<U+FB03>c safety
We use accident data covering the period 2008–2016 that distin-
guish victims by age group, mode and injury severity. We tested several
measures and found that accident hot spots contribute to explain mode
choice better than the mere number of injuries along a route. This is
especially true with respect to hot spots where pedestrian injuries (re-
gardless of age) or child injuries (pedestrian or cyclist) have occurred.
These two types of hot spots lead to very similar results, but are only
moderately correlated. We merged both into one binary variable that
captures whether or not the child needs to pass a site which can be
de<U+FB01>ned as either of these two hot spot types. We de<U+FB01>ne a ‘hot spot’ as a
place where at least four pedestrians were injured or killed in the ob-
servation period, or at least three children were injured or killed as
pedestrians or cyclists. These thresholds result in 16 and 15 hot spots,
respectively, and 26 hot spots overall. All hot spots are intersections.
The operational de<U+FB01>nition includs a radius of 30 m around the centre of
the intersection.

3.2.2. Road crossings and pavement width
Data on road infrastructure along the route does not necessarily
refer to the exact route a child actually takes. For instance, there may be
a convenient pavement on one side of the road, but not on the other.
However, the child may need to cross the road an extra time to use the
convenient pavement.
We manually reconstructed the ‘optimal’ route based on local
knowledge and plausibility considerations. We extracted width of pa-
vement (none, < 1 m, 1–1.5 m, > 1.5 m) and number of road crossings
required by type (light signal, zebra crossing, pedestrian refuge island,
other pedestrian facility, no facility (which mainly refers to low-speed
residential roads). Two variables exhibited signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects in bi-
variate regression: the number of zebra crossings that need to be
crossed, and length of road sections with narrow pavements (< 1 m).
These two variables are used for analysis. Interestingly, the length of
road sections with no pavement did not show any e<U+FB00>ect, probably be-
cause these mainly refer to tracks at a distance from roads.

3.2.3. Other built environment variables
A total of 31 variables (excluding tra<U+FB03>c safety and the need to cross
roads or use narrow pavements) were inspected with regard to bivariate
correlations. Strong correlations led to the decision to reduce the
variables using principal component analysis. Using Varimax rotation
(Eigenvalue > 1) resulted in eight dimensions explaining 75.1 percent
of the variance of the initial variables (Table 2). This procedure has
been used before in related research (e.g., Broberg et al., 2013). A
stepwise modelling process in which we exclude and re-include various
factors resulted in four out of eight factors that exhibited signi<U+FB01>cant
e<U+FB00>ects on mode choice. These are included in the <U+FB01>nal model. The use
of factors is in line with <U+FB01>ndings by Helbich (2017). He compares
various measures of land-use in child mode choice models, and achieves
the best explanation of variance with the use of principal components,
as compared to individual variables or composite measures.


Travel Behaviour and Society 15 (2019) 15–27


The <U+FB01>rst factor may require some explanation. The term ‘general
residential area’ is a formal term taken from German land-use planning.
It refers to a residential area with some limited non-residential use, such
as retail, services and businesses, but not industrial use. These areas
may be located either close to a city centre or – as in our case – in more
remote, former villages that have become part of an urban area. Given
their historical growth, they are often characterised by irregular
parking and sub-standard pedestrian and cycling facilities that fail to
meet today's planning standards.
Tables 4 and 5 give an overview of the variables <U+FB01>nally used in the
models.

3.3. Parental concerns, attitudes and perceptions

We also used principal component analysis with Varimax rotation
(Eigenvalue > 1) to reduce the 20 items that captured the respondents'
attitudes and concerns. This resulted in eight attitudinal dimensions
explaining 61.5 percent of the variance of the initial variables (Table 3).
This procedure has also been used before in related studies (Guliani
et al., 2015). As there is complete attitudinal information in only 851
cases, we use the factors to group variables into mean value scales as
indicated by the horizontal lines in Table 3 that show when at least two
valid answers are available for any scale. Three items were excluded to
achieve higher scale validity. Cronbach's alpha ranges between 0.60
and 0.86 for all scales but the last (‘child is competent’), which has a
Cronbach alpha value of only 0.31. After some discussion of this issue
we decided to use the scale anyway for theoretical reasons, as it may be
expected to exhibit an important e<U+FB00>ect on child travel (e.g., Villanueva
et al., 2013).
Only three factors show signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects and are thus retained in
the model. This means that some concerns and attitudes are insignif-
icant despite having been shown to be signi<U+FB01>cant in previous research,
including fear of nuisance, neighbourhood social capital, and a gen-
erally strong wish to protect one's child. This may be due to the geo-
graphical setting where the study was conducted, and where there may
be little variation in these variables.

3.4. Sociodemographics

We tested a variety of sociodemographic variables. The following
turned out insigni<U+FB01>cant in various modelling stages and were excluded
from the <U+FB01>nal models: household type (traditional family, lone parent,
other), parental education level (either separately or combined),
household income and equivalent income, household car ownership.
Mothers' and fathers' employment (full-time, part-time, none; either
separate or combined) was only signi<U+FB01>cant in the return trip model.
Further, we use child age and gender, mother's age (that was con-
sistently signi<U+FB01>cant), presence of a sibling of primary-school age, and
parental car use for the commute (that may to some extent capture
employment e<U+FB00>ects).

3.5. Trip distance

Trip distance is known to be among the strongest determinants of
mode use. However, it is likely that trip distance does not a<U+FB00>ect mode
use in a linear fashion. For instance, the probability to cycle rather than
walk may increase with distance, but decrease in higher distance
ranges. Hence, we include trip distance as a quadratic function.

3.6. Travel modes

The mode normally used for three types of situations was recorded
in the questionnaire: the outward trip and the return trip in the week
prior to the survey (January), and the school trip in summertime.
Respondents could state more than one mode for each of the trips. This
would typically refer to short-term variations in mode use but may

4. Findings

4.1. Descriptives



We begin with descriptive statistics to provide an overview of the
data. Table 4 shows mode use for the morning and the afternoon trips.
Mode use in summertime is also included for information.
About 38 percent of children walk to school, 32 percent are driven
by car, just under 12 percent cycle or use a scooter, 10 percent take the
bus (split evenly between school buses and public busses, not reported

in the table), and 8 percent combine or alternate between the car and

an active mode. Di<U+FB00>erences between the morning and afternoon trip are
only minor, but in summertime there is considerably more cycling (27
percent), while fewer children are driven by car (21 percent). The
combination of the car and an active mode is less frequent as well.


These <U+FB01>gures di<U+FB00>er somewhat from a trip-based analysis of trips to
and from school made by children of the same age (6–9) based on
nationwide data. Manz et al. (2015, 95) report a higher share of
walking trips (44 percent) and trips made by public transport (20

percent), but less cycling (8 percent) and less car use (28 percent). As

this study uses data collected in 2008, one may suspect that car use has
increased in the meantime, but it appears more likely that the stronger
car use and lower level of walking and public transport use in Lünen
re<U+FB02>ects the suburban character of the study area and increased car use
in winter.
A comparison between the schools reveals striking di<U+FB00>erences,
which are shown for the morning trip in Table 6.

The Kardinal-von-Galen school has the highest share of walking,
while other modes are below average. This corresponds with short trips
to school, i.e. a small catchment area, which may be because the school

is positioned close to the town centre.

The Leo and Lüserbach schools show the highest shares of car use,
while the Lüserbach school still has a strong share of walking children.
Long mean distances travelled to both schools contribute to this <U+FB01>nding,
while the distance median travelled to the Lüserbach school is low. This


implies that a strong share of students live in proximity to the school,
while others travel long distances. The long distances travelled to the
Leo school may have to do with the school's attractiveness for some
German-born parents. The school has a strikingly low share of im-

migrant students. Only 2 percent of the students do not speak German

at home, as compared to 15 percent for all schools taken together
(values for 2016/17 provided by the City of Lünen, unpublished). What
is more, the Leo school is located very close to an overly wide main road
with a heavy tra<U+FB03>c load, which is re<U+FB02>ected in low subjective safety.
The statement ‘I consider the route to school safe’ reaches a low 2.73
agreement on a scale ranging from one to <U+FB01>ve, as compared to 3.08 for
all schools considered together (di<U+FB00>erence signi<U+FB01>cant, p < 0.001).
The Elisabeth school has an almost zero share of the bus, while the
share of cycling is above average. Students in this school also travel
short distances on average. Virtually all students live in Brambauer, the

neighbourhood that hosts the school in its periphery. This location
contributes both to not using the bus and to cycling.
The Gottfried school has high shares of cycling and bus use, while
walking is below average. The Matthias-Claudius school has an ex-
tremely large share of bus use, while all other modes are below average.
Two-thirds of the bus travellers use a school bus here. Both schools are
located in the same place, a comparatively a<U+FB04>uent residential area at
the edge of town. Distances travelled are longer to the Matthias-
Claudius school than to the Gottfried school, which explains the strong
use of the bus, while the remote location also helps explain the high
shares of cycling and bus use in the Gottfried school.
The Heikenberg comes closest to the average of all schools, although
trip distances are somewhat higher than average. This is again due to
the school being located at the edge of town.


4.2. Regression models

We start by presenting the morning trip model (Table 7) and add
<U+FB01>ndings from the afternoon trip model (Table 8) where there are no-
table di<U+FB00>erences. It should be noted that in all cases where an e<U+FB00>ect is
signi<U+FB01>cant in one of the models, but insigni<U+FB01>cant in the other, the e<U+FB00>ect
sign is in the same direction. Walking serves as a reference category.
Both models show a good <U+FB01>t, with Pseudo R-square values ranging
between 0.33/0.34 (McFadden) and 0.65 (Nagelkerke).


4.2.1. Sociodemographics
As expected, the odds of cycling as opposed to walking increase with
child age. Children receive an informal cycling license in the fourth
form after a test supervised by the police. Other modes are less dis-
tinctly di<U+FB00>erent from walking, as regards age. Girls are less likely to
cycle as opposed to walking (e<U+FB00>ect is insigni<U+FB01>cant in the afternoon trip
model). Having a sibling of primary school age (who may possibly at-
tend the same school, although we cannot conclusively determine this)

reduces the odds of being driven home from school.
Interestingly, having an older mother reduces the odds of cycling or
being taken to school by car, as opposed to walking (car use e<U+FB00>ect in-
signi<U+FB01>cant in the afternoon trip model). We have no clear interpretation
for this <U+FB01>nding, but we want to point out that the associations between
maternal age and mode use turned out signi<U+FB01>cant in all modelling
stages. Older mothers (with children of a young age) tend to have fewer
children, and we suspect that this may motivate them to walk their
child to school more than other mothers do.
Parental employment status was excluded from the morning trip
model due to a lack of signi<U+FB01>cance. From the afternoon trip model it
can be seen that mothers being unemployed is associated with lower
odds of bus use and car use (the latter just fails to reach signi<U+FB01>cance).
Part-time employment among mothers does not show a signi<U+FB01>cant ef-
fect that di<U+FB00>ers from full-time employment. Also, paternal employment
does not have any e<U+FB00>ect on child mode use, no matter which categories

are distinguished.

4.2.2. Commute mode
Mothers driving to work strongly increase the odds of their child
being driven to school. The father's mode to work does not exhibit any
signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect.


4.2.3. Attitudes
Three dimensions of parental concerns show some signi<U+FB01>cant ef-
fects. Firstly, a general di<U+FB00>use feeling of fear increases the odds of being
driven, rather than walking to school. In the afternoon model the same
association is found for combined use of active modes and the car, but
just fails to reach signi<U+FB01>cance. Secondly, the more the parents judge
pavements (sidewalks) and lighting on the school route to be in good
condition, the more likely it is that their child may cycle to school,
rather than walk. On the afternoon trip, this perception is also sig-
ni<U+FB01>cantly associated with lower odds of car use. Thirdly, the more a

parent considers the child competent, the less likely it is that the child is
driven to school, rather than being allowed to walk. On the afternoon
trip, this attitude is also signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with lower odds of bus
use.
Attitudes and concerns may be endogeneous to sociodemographics
and the built environment. Additional models were estimated excluding
attitudes (available from the authors upon request). These largely
con<U+FB01>rm the results of the models presented here and, thus, there do not
seem to be notable biases in estimations.

4.2.4. Trip distance
Trip distance has a non-linear relationship with mode use, as ex-
pressed in signi<U+FB01>cant quadratic functions. The e<U+FB00>ects of distance and
squared distance need to be considered in tandem. They suggest that
the odds for any mode against walking increase with distance, but the
slopes decrease. The maximum increase for car passenger and, even
more so, for bus travel, is at a lower distance than for cycling. The
bicycle reaches its maximum odds against walking at a distance of
about four kilometres.


4.2.5. Built environment

Four general factors describing the built environment along the

route a<U+FB00>ect child mode use. Firstly, routes along ‘general residential

areas’ are associated with higher odds of bus and car use against

walking. Bus use is insigni<U+FB01>cant in the afternoon model. On the other

hand, the afternoon model suggests higher odds of cycling in general

residential areas. These associations can be linked to the remote loca-

tion of the residential areas that score high on this factor.

Secondly, routes in areas characterised by industrial land uses are

associated with lower odds of bus use. This relates to an industrial area

close to the Kardinal-von-Galen school (low level of bus use) on the one
hand, and the Gottfried and Matthias-Claudius schools on the other
hand. Both schools are located in a somewhat remote residential area
(i.e. very low values of industrial land use), and characterised by high
shares of bus use.
Thirdly, routes along main roads with a restricted view may be
associated with higher odds of car use (but note that the e<U+FB00>ect just fails
to reach signi<U+FB01>cance, and is clearly insigni<U+FB01>cant in the afternoon
model). Fourthly, areas with tra<U+FB03>c calming are associated with higher
odds of cycling, but also bus use and, in the afternoon, car use.
Neighbourhoods with high values on this dimension are Nordlünen and
Lünen-South. In Lünen-South children typically attend either the Leo or
Lüserbach school, which may explain the positive e<U+FB00>ect on car use. The
Lüserbach school is located somewhat remote in a low-density area,
where driving is more common, while the Leo school – as pointed out
above – has a large catchment area due to its attractiveness, which
results in long distances travelled. In Nordlünen things are somewhat
more mixed. Children mostly attend the Kardinal-von-Galen school or
Gottfried school. The Gottfried school is located in a somewhat remote
area, and it scores high on the tra<U+FB03>c calming factor. It has the lowest
share of walking in all schools, but high shares of cycling and bus use.

The Matthias-Claudius school is located at the same site, and has the

strongest bus use among all schools, which also contributes to the po-

sitive bus e<U+FB00>ect. The Kardinal-von-Galen school is centrally located and

scores very low on tra<U+FB03>c calming, while many children walk. All these

local circumstances may contribute to the association between tra<U+FB03>c

calming and mode use.

Over and above these broad factors, three more speci<U+FB01>c variables

exhibit signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects. Firstly, route length along roads with narrow

pavements is associated with higher odds of cycling and car use. The




J. Scheiner et al.


latter e<U+FB00>ect is insigni<U+FB01>cant in the afternoon model. While the e<U+FB00>ect on
car use is in line with expectations, the cycling e<U+FB00>ect may again be due
to local circumstances. Two residential neighbourhoods score low on
the narrow pavements variable, and at the same time many children
from these neighbourhoods attend the Lüserbach school where the
share of cycling is low.
Secondly, the number of zebra crossings that need to be crossed is
positively associated with both regular car use and occasional car use
(combined with an active mode). Both e<U+FB00>ects are insigni<U+FB01>cant in the
afternoon model, while in this model the need to cross zebra crossings is
associated with lower odds of bus use. Thirdly, accident hot spots along
the route are negatively associated with bus use. Again, this e<U+FB00>ect is
insigni<U+FB01>cant in the afternoon model. The Leo and Lüserbach schools
(and, less so, the Kardinal-von-Galen school) stand out with above-
average shares of students who need to pass an accident hot spot, and at
the same time these schools are characterised by low bus use.
Conversely, the Gottfried and Heikenberg schools have a low pre-
valence of accident hot spots, while bus use is strong.

5. Summary and conclusions for policy and research

This paper is one of the few studies of children's mode use for school
trips in Germany. It is arguably the <U+FB01>rst one in Germany that simulta-
neously looks at the full range of dimensions that may help under-
standings of mode use: (1) trip characteristics, (2) child characteristics,
(3) the household context, (4) subjective concerns, attitudes and per-
ceptions, (5) the transport environment, (6) the built environment and
(7) the social environment. In constrast to the majority of studies in the
<U+FB01>eld, an attempt was made to capture a holistic picture of the transport
and land-use environment along the route, while at the same time some
key attributes of the route were used as separate variables.
The results are largely in line with existing research in terms of
distance e<U+FB00>ects, age and gender di<U+FB00>erences. It is also well-known that
mothers' attributes a<U+FB00>ect child travel, but fathers' attributes less so
(here in terms of car use, employment and age). The reason for the
signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects of mothers' age is not clear and warrants further
consideration.
In contrast to much other research we found no direct e<U+FB00>ects of
income or parental education, nor did we <U+FB01>nd evidence for e<U+FB00>ects of the
social environment (as re<U+FB02>ected in subjective judgements of parents). It
has also been found before that the probability of walking and cycling
increases with age while we found only a signi<U+FB01>cant increase in the
odds of cycling against walking. An important conclusion is thus that it
may not be reasonable to merge cycling and walking into one mode
category, as the two modes have distinctly di<U+FB00>erent characteristics.
The impact of urban form and the transport system along the trip is
of particular interest from the perspective of urban development and
transport planning. A number of points may be highlighted.
One dimension of parental attitudes clearly refers to the transport
environment. Parents who state that pavements and lighting are in a
good condition seem to be more inclined to let their child cycle rather
than walk, and they have lower odds of picking their child up by car
after school. The link between pavements and cycling is not obvious,
but note that primary-school children are allowed to cycle on pave-
ments in Germany up to their 10th birthday (and are legally supposed
to do so until their 8th birthday). This is clearly supported by reason-
ably wide paths to avoid con<U+FB02>icts between cycling children and pe-
destrians. This e<U+FB00>ect suggests that good infrastructure helps.
The other signi<U+FB01>cant attitudes rather suggest broader concerns that
may or may not refer to the local environment along the route. Parents
who exhibit fears in a broad sense have stronger odds of driving their
child to and from school. The opposite is the case for parents who
consider their child competent. While the <U+FB01>rst of these e<U+FB00>ects seems to
refer to a psychographic attribute of the responding parent, the second
may well refer to inter-individual di<U+FB00>erences between children over
and above ‘naturally’ increasing competence emerging with age. Both

associations, however, do not necessarily preclude policy interventions,
as the concerns expressed may well be addressed by interactive con-
cepts.
The general attributes of the areas along the route di<U+FB00>er between
the morning and afternoon trip in terms of signi<U+FB01>cance, but are con-
sistent in terms of e<U+FB00>ect signs. Nonetheless, some of them are not easy
to interpret. Routes along general residential areas seem to increase the
odds of cycling, bus use and being driven as opposed to walking. One
reason for this may be that these areas are often characterised by re-
mote post-war developments with mixed land-use, but dominant
housing, often with little dedication in terms of upgrading pedestrian
networks.
Tra<U+FB03>c calming is associated with higher odds of cycling, which is in
line with expectations, and bus use or being driven (back home), which
is less in line with expectations, but may be due to local circumstances.
Having to walk along main roads with a restricted view may also in-
crease the likelihood to be driven, but the e<U+FB00>ect is only moderate and
just fails to reach signi<U+FB01>cance.
The prevalence of narrow pavements along the route increases the
odds of car use, but also cycling, against walking. This is again probably
due to local circumstances in two residential neighbourhoods. The need
to use zebra crossings shows increased odds of car use. This may well
indicate parental concern about letting their child cross the road at a
site where the child has the right of way but drivers may not always
give it to them (which is di<U+FB00>erent from a light signal). Objective tra<U+FB03>c
safety is found to a<U+FB00>ect mode use very moderately at best. The only
signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect is the reduced odds of using the bus for routes that
cross accident hot spots. This may again be due to local situations.
Two more transport-related parameters deserve attention for policy,
although they are not strictly related to the transport environment.
Firstly, distance belongs to the most consistent variables that a<U+FB00>ect
children's mode use. Reducing distances to schools (or at least main-
taining the existing distances) by providing a decentralised network of
schools thus contributes to stronger use of active modes. Secondly, any
attempt to reduce parental car use may also reduce the likelihood that a
child is driven to or from school.
Taken overall, the results provide a rich, but mixed picture. Some
environment variables have notable signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects that generally
con<U+FB01>rm other studies and/or are in line with reasonable expectations
and may be generalised, while other signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ects are more likely
due to speci<U+FB01>c local circumstances that make straightforward inter-
pretation di<U+FB03>cult in some cases.
For future research, this means that there still seems to be a lot to do
even though the <U+FB01>eld has increased tremendeously in the past few
years. We struggled with the strong correlations between various built
environment and transport environment variables that preclude the
identi<U+FB01>cation of clear-cut isolated variables that help understand the
e<U+FB00>ects of the environment. What is more, we suspect that there are very
nuanced details of the environment that motivate parents to let their
child walk or cycle, or not (as studied by Ghekiere et al., 2018, using an
experimental approach). Such nuances may relate to the social en-
vironment (e.g., temporal meeting places of elder children along the
route), to parental activity patterns (e.g. timing of work trips), and to
interactions between parents and their children, e.g. when children
pressurise parents to drive them.
