weekday school commutes, most migrant pupils walk (77.48%) or commute by motorcycle (17.57%), whereas
most household registered pupils walk (34.51%) or commute by private car (29.53%) or motorcycle (24.67%).

Plan (STP) program. Buliung et al. (2009) explained temporal and
spatial trends in active transportation for school trips in the Greater
Toronto Area, Canada's largest city-region. McDonald (2007) identi<U+FB01>ed
the causes of change in active transportation to school over the past 30
years in the U.S.
In addition to the trend of pupils' active commuting, several studies
have also found the impact of personal characteristics, distance, built
environment, parents and other in<U+FB02>uence factors on pupils' active
commuting. Leslie et al. (2010) and McDonald (2012) studied the e<U+FB00>ect
of gender on students' active commuting and found that boys biked to
school more than girls. Hinckson et al. (2011) reported a high like-
lihood of older children engaging in active commuting. Distance is an
important in<U+FB02>uential factor in pupils' active commuting to school.

Analyzing the United States National Personal Transportation Survey
data, McDonald (2007) showed that distance from home to school

might account for a decline on the number of students who walk or bike

to school. In the aspect of built environment, Mitra and Buliung (2012)

found that block density, signalized intersections and walking density

were associated with active travel. In addition, the impact of parents on

students' active commuting mainly included parents’ perception of

tra<U+FB03>c danger (Rothman et al., 2015), parental employment status and

commute patterns (McDonald, 2008b). The latter is caused by the fact
that many children who commute to school are accompanied by their
parents.
Studies on students' active commuting from the perspective of
household registration are rare because household registration systems
are uncommon worldwide. Foreign research on di<U+FB00>erent groups of
people focuses mainly on analyzing of low-income and minority groups.
McDonald (2008a) showed that low-income and minority groups, par-
ticularly blacks and Hispanics, use active travel modes to commute to
school at much higher rates than whites or higher-income students.
Moreover, few people pay attention to students’ active commuting to
school in China. Sun et al. (2015) examined the mode of transport to
school in China in terms of the physical and mental well-being of na-
tional representative samples of children. In China, most scholars
studying students’ commuting focus mainly on analyzing the compo-
sition of students’ travel mode; then, they put forward the corre-
sponding tra<U+FB03>c improvement measures (Han et al., 2011; He and Li,
2007). The survey of a primary school in Nanjing found that the pupils
who commute to schools mainly take private cars, electric bicycles and
bicycles, and measures to encourage public transportation and school
bus service were proposed (Han et al., 2011). Several scholars have also
begun to pay attention to the in<U+FB02>uence of parents' travel mode and
employment status on students' mode of commuting (He et al., 2014;
Ma et al., 2016).
Students' active commuting is a<U+FB00>ected by personal characteristics,
the built environment, family and so on, but few studies have analyzed
the di<U+FB00>erences in students' active travel in di<U+FB00>erent groups from the
perspective of household registration. Therefore, this paper aims to
conduct research on this aspect. The overall framework is as follows:
Sections 2 and 3 describe the study areas and investigation process of
student commutes. Through the data obtained, Section 4 provides de-
scriptive statistics on characteristics of students' commutes to school,
which includes statistics of modes and distance regarding students'
commutes to school; Section 5 establishes the logistic regression model
of students' active commuting to school; Section 6 discusses and sum-
marizes this research and prospects for the next stage of the study.

2. Geographical setting

Located in the southeast coast of Fujian Province, Jinjiang is one of
the most developed cities in China. Its comprehensive competitiveness,
it ranked <U+FB01>fth of the top 100 counties (cities) in 2012. Most enterprises
in Jinjiang are labor-intensive enterprises that attract a large number of
migrant workers to work in Jinjiang. According to the sixth national
Chinese census data (Jinjiang Statistics Bureau, 2012), the permanent

Case Studies on Transport Policy 5 (2017) 656–661
population in Jinjiang is 1.99 million, of which the migrant population
with registration in other cities is 1.01 million. At the end of 2012, the
number of pupils in Jinjiang reached 164,100, of which the number of
local household registered pupils was 54,900 and the number of mi-
grant pupils was almost twice as large (109,200). Most migrants in
Jinjiang do not have urban household registration, and the di<U+FB00>erences
in employment and income between migrant people and household
registered people cause di<U+FB00>erences in their children’s school commute
characteristics. This paper uses Jinjiang as an example to provide a
basis for school commutes between di<U+FB00>erent groups of pupils during the
urbanization process in China.


3. Data sources and investigation design


Because of the unknown amount of household registered and mi-

grant pupils for all schools, a two-stage sampling survey was adopted;

sampling was <U+FB01>rst conducted on schools and then on students.

Moreover, because of the di<U+FB00>erent distances between students’ re-

sidences and schools, the school commute pattern may vary. Therefore,

this study designed the questionnaire based on students’ school com-

muting patterns.


3.1. Phased sampling design

Provision 12 of the “People’s Republic of China Compulsory
Education Law” stipulates that local governments at all levels should
guarantee the education rights of school-age children and adolescents
to attend nearby schools in household registered districts without en-
trance exams. In recent years, a student who enters a school outside of
household registered districts must pay high-priced school selection
fees, which attempt to deter students from attending these schools and
thereby avoid overcrowding in schools that o<U+FB00>er higher-quality edu-
cation. Meanwhile, housing prices increase every year in the districts
with high-quality schools. To some extent, high-quality schools are
often surrounded with students from high-income families. Therefore,
the research data includes commuting conditions for pupils throughout
the city and also re<U+FB02>ect that di<U+FB00>erent groups of people have di<U+FB00>erent
access to education resources. School samples were collected from
various districts, and student samples were collected from di<U+FB00>erent
schools.
The total urban area of Jinjiang is 721.7 km2 and includes the fol-
lowing four districts: the main urban district; the west urban district;
the Andong district; and the Jinnan district. According to their educa-
tion quality, primary schools are classi<U+FB01>ed into demonstration schools
and regular schools, where demonstration schools o<U+FB00>er higher educa-
tion quality than regular schools. Because Jinjiang city is a balanced
development, each district has demonstration schools and regular
schools. The di<U+FB00>erence is that the demonstration schools are located in
the central area of each district, and the density of the road network is
higher. Because of the implementation of zone divisions and the policy
of admission into the nearest school in Jinjiang, housing prices are high
around demonstration schools, and many migrant children have no
opportunity to attend these demonstration schools. According to the
district distribution, one primary school was selected from each district.
Then, two demonstration schools and two regular schools were sampled
on the basis of di<U+FB00>erent types of schools. The speci<U+FB01>c sampling method
is shown in Fig. 1.
Given the strict management of Jinjiang primary schools, it is dif-
<U+FB01>cult to investigate all students at all schools after the school sampling,
so the better choice is conduct a sampling survey in classes. Two classes
(excluding experimental classes, key classes and other special classes)
were randomly selected in each grade, and students were randomly
selected from the sampled classes for investigation. Special classes were
excluded because the proportion of students in these types of classes is
less than 10% of a regular class (Fig. 2).

3.2. Questionnaire design based on school commuting patterns

3.2.1. School commuting patterns
Because the distances between students’ residences and the school
vary, some local parents shorten their children’s school commute dis-
tance by adjusting their residence. For instance, some parents may rent
an apartment that is closer to the school, thus creating a school com-
muting pattern: renting housing near schools. Commuting to school
means that students go back and forth between schools and home on
weekdays. Renting housing near schools is a special school commute
pattern in which students live in a rented place during weekdays and
return home on the weekends. The two patterns are very di<U+FB00>erent from
one another and can easily be distinguished.
These di<U+FB00>erent school commute patterns generate weekday com-
mutes and weekend commutes. Students who commute to schools only
have weekday commutes, and students who rent housing close to
schools have both weekday and weekend commutes. To obtain a de-
tailed understanding of students’ school commuting characteristics
when designing the questionnaire, we investigated weekday school
commutes according to the students’ school commuting patterns.

3.2.2. Main content of the questionnaire
The questionnaire includes the following: (1) students’ individual
characteristics, including age, gender, place of household registration,
school attended, grade, address during school time, weekend address,
etc.; and (2) students’ school commute characteristics and records of
types of school commuting modes, commuting time and whether or not
they are picked up by their parents.

3.2.3. Survey implementation
From September 5 to September 10, 2012, the questionnaires were

distributed to each school, and the survey was organized by the cor-
responding teachers. The number of students in Schools A1, A2, B1, and
B2 is 274, 746, 2902 and 1589, respectively. Because there are fewer
demonstration schools, the number of students in the demonstration
schools is higher than that in the regular schools. Schools A1, A2, B1,
and B2 returned 244, 272, 267, and 295 surveys with valid information,
respectively, which were equally distributed in each grade, as we
sampled 2 classes in each grade in every school. Low-grade pupils (1–2
grades) were represented by teachers who completed the ques-
tionnaires after consulting the students, whereas high-grade pupils (3–6
grades) <U+FB01>lled in the questionnaire by themselves with the help of their
teachers.
According to Table 1, female students account for 40%–50% of all
students (according to statistics, the proportion of female pupils was
43.8% in Jinjiang City by the end of 2012.). In the course of the in-
e.
vestigation, some students are registered as “Xusui” (In China, “Xusui”
means one year or two years older than the actual age), which makes
statistical analysis a di<U+FB03>cult task. Therefore, we count the pupils in
each grade for replacement, and the proportion of low-grade pupils is
approximately 30% of the sample. In addition, migrant pupils attend
mainly regular schools (the proportion of migrant pupils in school A2
was 90%), and almost no migrant pupils attend demonstration schools.
From the perspective of school education quality, the household re-
gistration system leads to an uneven allocation of education resources.
Consequently, schools A1 and A2 represent migrant pupils, whereas
schools B1 and B2 represent the household registered pupils. We also
<U+FB01>nd that the proportion of parents accompanying household registered
pupils to and from school is much higher that the corresponding pro-
portion for migrant pupils. Even high-grade household registered pu-
pils, the proportion of parents accompany is also high (more than 70%).
However, for migrant pupils, the proportion of parents accompanying
high-grade and low-grade students varies greatly, and the proportion of
parents accompanying high-grade pupils is low (Table 1). In addition,
the school hours of the 4 primary schools investigated are 8:10–11:25
a.m. to 2:20–5:05 p.m., and they all have bicycle parking for students.


4. School commuting characteristics

The average daily trip distance of the surveyed students is 1.57 km,
which indicates that most of the students reside close to schools. All the
migrant pupils commute to school, with a commuting ratio (the pro-
portion of the commute between schools and home on weekdays) of
100%. Small numbers of household registered pupils rent housing near
their schools, with a commuting ratio exceeding 90% (Table 1). These
658

Y. Gao et al.
<U+FB01>ndings are related to the relatively small size of the city, and the
sampled schools do not have boarding students.
The weekday school commute may cause many tra<U+FB03>c problems, so
the following section of this paper analyzes the relationship between
pupils’ weekday school commute modes and active commuting char-
acteristics. The commuting distance is a signi<U+FB01>cant factor a<U+FB00>ecting
students’ active commuting to school. Therefore, this study further
analyzes the school commute distance distribution for di<U+FB00>erent groups.

4.1. Weekday school commuting mode

Currently in Jinjiang, the weekday school commuting modes in-
clude walking and commuting via bicycle, electric bicycle, private car,
motorcycle, bus, or taxi. Walking and commuting by motorcycle and
private car are the main commuting modes for pupils’ school trips,
accounting for 92.79% of all school trips.
The distribution of pupils’ weekday school commuting modes
among household registration groups was tested using Pearson’s chi
Square. The results show that 77.48% of migrant pupils walk to school,
whereas 34.51% of household registered pupils walk to school.
However, the proportion of private car trips for household registered
pupils is much higher than the proportion of private car trips for mi-

grant pupils (29.53% versus 2.06%, respectively). It is also worth
noting that motorcycle trips represent a certain proportion of Jinjiang
pupils’ school commutes for both household registered pupils and mi-
grant pupils (Table 2).


4.2. Weekday active commuting to school

The pupils’ primary commuting modes are walking, which is char-
acterized as active commuting, and commuting via private car and
motorcycle, which are classi<U+FB01>ed as inactive commuting. The proportion

of pupils’ active commuting (accounting for the above three trip modes)
is 59.91%, and the proportion of parents accompanying pupils’ active

commuting is only 14.14%. That is to say, most students are in-

dependent active commuters. Table 2 shows that the proportion of

household registered pupils’ active commuting is much lower than

migrant pupils’ active commuting (38.9% compared with79.79%).

Household registration is strongly associated with pupils’ active com-

muting (<U+03C7>2 = 102.122, df = 1, p < 0.001).


4.3. Weekday school commute distance distribution

The trip distance of the pupils’ three primary trip modes reveals that
the majority of the migrant pupils attend nearby schools. More than
90% of the migrant pupils’ commute distances are within 2 km, while
the corresponding percentage for household registered pupils is
66.06%. It is worth noting that 23.55% of the household registered
pupils’ commute distance exceeds 3 km. The commute distance of the
household registered pupils exceeds the commute distance of the mi-
grant pupils by more than 2 km, which increases the motorized trips for
the household registered pupils. Meanwhile, the proportion of the

household registered pupils whose trip distance is within 2 km is more

than 60%, while the proportion of their active commuting is less than
40%. Therefore, some household registered pupils who live near
schools also use motorized transportation.

5. Weekday active commuting and school choice

To analyze the individual commuting regularity of di<U+FB00>erent groups,
this study uses age, gender, and trip distance as factors to analyze the
two groups of students because trip distance is a signi<U+FB01>cant factor of
students’ active commuting choice. In Jinjiang, 6-year-old children
enter primary schools for compulsory education; therefore, the majority
of students’ age in the same grade is the same. In the modeling process,
the grade index is used instead of age.

5.1. Analysis method

A binary logistic regression model was conducted to examine the
e<U+FB00>ect of multiple factors on pupils’ choices of weekday active com-
muting to school. Grade is a dummy variable, and gender is a catego-
rical variable. The speci<U+FB01>c formula is shown below:
P= exp(a + ß1x1 + ß2 x2+…+ ßm xm)/(1 + exp(a + ß1x1 + ß2 x2+…+ßm xm))

…,xm- Factors that in<U+FB02>uence pupils’ weekday active commuting to
school; and a,ß1,ß2,…,ßm– Regression coe<U+FB03>cient.
We used the odds ratio (OR value) to judge the di<U+FB00>erences in in-
<U+FB02>uencing factors between the two groups, which is an index that re-

<U+FB02>ects the correlation intensity:
OR = P/(1 - P)                                                                     (2)


5.2. Model results


The model <U+FB01>ts better for the migrant pupils (Nagelkerke

R2 = 0.382) than for the household registered pupils (Nagelkerke

R2 = 0.362). Table 3 shows that for household registered pupils, grade

has no signi<U+FB01>cant in<U+FB02>uence on their active commuting to school

(p > 0.05), while gender and commute distance signi<U+FB01>cantly impact

their active commuting to school (p < 0.05). For migrant pupils, both

grade and trip distance signi<U+FB01>cantly in<U+FB02>uence their active commuting
to school (p < 0.001).
Age was found to be a signi<U+FB01>cant contributor (Hinckson et al.,
2011). The probability of weekday active commuting to school among
migrant pupils from <U+FB01>rst grade to fourth grade increases each year. The
OR value for <U+FB01>rst grade is 0.004, and for fourth grade, it is 0.123, which
shows that the students' independence becomes increasingly stronger
with the increase in age. However, active commuting to school de-
creases beginning in <U+FB01>fth grade (OR = 0.062). For the household

registered pupils, grade is not signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with active
commuting to school.
In terms of commute distance, the probability of active commuting
to school because of trip distance is greater for the migrant pupils than
for the household registered pupils. For household registered pupils, the
OR value of the trip distance is 0.263; however, for migrant pupils, the
OR value of the trip distance reaches 0.461. The household registered
pupils’ active commuting to school is in<U+FB02>uenced signi<U+FB01>cantly by the trip
distance, and its probability distribution based on the variable trip
distance is shown in Fig. 3. There is a nonlinear relationship between
trip distance and the probability of household registered pupils’
weekday active commuting to school. With increasing trip distance, the
probability of household registered pupils’ weekday active commuting
to school gradually decreases. When the commute distance is 2 km, the
probability of the household registered pupils’ active commuting to
school drops below 20%. When the commute distance is 4 km, the
probability of the household registered pupils’ active commuting to
school is approximately 0%, but for migrant pupils, the commute dis-
tance is 6 km (Fig. 3).


6. Discussion and conclusion


We designed the questionnaire according to domestic pupils’ school

commuting patterns (commuting and renting housing near schools) and

conducted the survey to obtain data on the household registered and

migrant pupils’ weekday school commuting. Although we still need to

investigate students' family and built environment as future work, we

nevertheless found di<U+FB00>erences between migrant and household regis-

tered pupils’ commutes in the context of urbanization in China.

In China, several scholars have found that the travel mode varies by

the type of primary school (Han et al., 2011; He and Li, 2007). He and

Li’s (2007) study of two demonstration schools and one regular school

in Wuhan City found that pupils from the demonstration schools mainly

use cars (> 30%) followed by buses, and approximately 70% of pupils

from regular schools walk to school. In addition, Han’s (Han et al.,

2011) study of a demonstration school in Nanjing City revealed that

electric bicycles and cars are the main commuting modes; the propor-

tion of private cars used was 29%. Due to the di<U+FB00>erent sizes of di<U+FB00>erent

cities (Wuhan and Nanjing are big cities in China, while Jinjiang is a

medium-sized city), students’ commuting distance is di<U+FB00>erent, which in

turn makes the students' travel modes di<U+FB00>erent. Meanwhile, these dif-
ferences can also apply to di<U+FB00>erent types of schools. Private motorized
transportation modes are the most common among pupils of demon-

stration schools, and walking is the main mode for pupils of regular
schools. This result reveals that pupils from regular schools mainly at-

tend nearby schools. Unlike other cities, Jinjiang has a larger propor-
tion of migrants, most of whose children study in regular schools.
Meanwhile, Jinjiang has a higher level of economic development,

which leads to a higher proportion of private cars used for commutes to
demonstration schools. Moreover, the rate of pupils walking to schools
is high, which has a certain relationship with the subtropical climate
zone in which Jinjiang is located.
Commuting distance has a signi<U+FB01>cant impact on active transporta-
tion in Jinjiang city. Moreover, the commute distance has a greater
in<U+FB02>uence on household registered pupils than on migrant pupils; 2 km
is a barrier for household registered pupils’ weekday active school
commuting, which is related to the pupils' active commuting mode:
walking. In addition, given that pupils' independence is relatively low,
these students are unable to walk or ride bikes to schools independently
because they do not have enough capabilities to navigate the neigh-
borhood environment when the distance exceeds a certain limit. At the
same time, according to He et al. (2014), the commuting constraints
related to the occupations of students’ parents have an impact on the
travel modes of di<U+FB00>erent groups. Since most of the migrant population
in Jinjiang is low-income workers, the probability of migrant pupils’
active commuting is higher than that for household registered pupils.
Moreover, most of parents in migrant group accompany pupils to and
from school only when students are at low-grade, while the proportion
of parents accompany is high for both low-grade and high-grade

household registered pupils. Therefore, age signi<U+FB01>cantly a<U+FB00>ects only
migrant pupils. Because the proportion of migrant pupils’ parents who

accompany their children when commuting is low and regular schools

are not usually at the center of the district, the corresponding measures

should be taken to build a safe route for migrant pupils, while the safety

education of migrant pupils should address this issue, as children’s

safety behavior is not yet mature.

Existing studies have found that the school commuting modes

among pupils of di<U+FB00>erent groups are comprehensively a<U+FB00>ected by in-

dividual characteristics, such as the family, built environment and other

factors. However, there are other aspects that we are unable to cover in

our research. Parents' subjective attitudes towards younger pupils' in-

dependent commuting is not considered here. Additionally, the in<U+FB02>u-

ence of cultural di<U+FB00>erences between migrant populations and house-

hold registered populations on students' commutes is uncertain.

Transportation facilities such as school buses and city buses should also

be further assessed in terms of school commutes. In conclusion, we

leave these in<U+FB02>uential factors for future work to be able to provide more

exact and comprehensive results for tra<U+FB03>c measures based on di<U+FB00>erent

groups
