data were collected with the help of travel diaries including speci<U+FB01>c information on travel accompaniment. In
the second step, in-depth interviews with parents were conducted. Although the data can only provide a
snapshot of the independent mobility of primary school children, this study con<U+FB01>rms that active and in-
dependent mobility is the result of a variety of factors. The results indicate that – besides trip distance and age
–the type of school (all-day/half-day primary school) is likewise relevant. Based on the parents' assessments,
signi<U+FB01>cant sharing of trips takes place in case travel accompaniment is unnecessary. Depending on the parents'
attitudes towards AIM, we identi<U+FB01>ed three “pro<U+FB01>les” (Promoters, Pragmatists and Protectors). Linking these
pro<U+FB01>les to indicators of AIM reveals that di<U+FB00>erent attitudes manifest themselves in children's travel patterns. The
results are limited as only two schools served as sources of data and it was not possible to decouple the parental
pro<U+FB01>les from children's ages. Overall, it can be concluded that there is potential for improved active and in-
dependent mobility in children. To be e<U+FB00>ective, future campaigns need to consider parental attitudes.

terviews in pursuit of better understanding of the background be-
hind mobility decisions and linking these parental attitudes to their
children's mobility licenses and other indicators of AIM.

The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of
<U+FB01>ndings from existing studies in the <U+FB01>eld of the independent mobility of
children. The survey approach and instruments are described in Section
3. This section also includes a presentation on the school settings and
sample characteristics. The results are presented in Section 4, starting
with an overview of indicators of children's active and independent
mobility given consideration of the two school locations (Section 4.1).
The results on parents' attitudes and their interrelation with their
children's mobility behaviour are subsequently shown (Section 4.2). In
the conclusion section (Section 5), the determinants of children's in-
dependent and active mobility are discussed and recommendations for
future research are derived accordingly.

2. Literature review

An international study of the Policy Studies Institute on children's
independent mobility throughout 16 countries (Austria did not take
part) found that children's independent mobility varies widely (Shaw
et al., 2015). Where comparable data are available, studies show that
the independent mobility of school children has actually declined over
time (e.g. Hillman et al., 1990; Shaw et al., 2013; Frauendienst and
Redecker, 2011; Funk, 2008). Independent mobility is a complex phe-
nomenon resulting from various in<U+FB02>uences. According to the beha-
vioural model of school transportation (BMST) (Mitra, 2013), key fac-
tors are the physical environment, external in<U+FB02>uences such as the
surrounding social-political context, but also child, parent (or guardian)
and household characteristics. According to the conceptual framework
of BMST, all of these factors directly or indirectly a<U+FB00>ect the child's
travel patterns and show complex interconnections. What's more, in-
dependent mobility and mode choice a<U+FB00>ect each other, since car use
leads inevitably to escorted travel. From a legal perspective, this is also
the case for cycling up to the age of 12 or 10, respectively (after positive
cycling pro<U+FB01>ciency test) in Austria. Meanwhile using public transport
unaccompanied is allowed from the age of 6.
Although literature reviews show that studies in this <U+FB01>eld o<U+FB00>er a
variety of (partly inconsistent) <U+FB01>ndings which are not generalizable
(Potoglou and Arslangulova, 2017), they are unanimous in their as-
sessment that parents and their perception of the urban environment
are a relevant factor for independent mobility (Shaw et al., 2015). This
is obvious, as the mobility of children – especially at a young age – is to
a large extent an outcome of choices made by parents. Parental concern
about the danger caused by road tra<U+FB03>c is speci<U+FB01>cally identi<U+FB01>ed as a
motivation for frequent shuttling by car (e.g. Limbourg, 2010; Funk and
Fassmann, 2002; DiGuiseppi et al., 1998; Wittenberg et al., 1987;
Waygood and Susilo, 2015; Wen et al., 2008). This connection reveals a
vicious cycle. Parents' risk perception prevents them from granting
active and independent mobility (AIM) to their children. As a con-
sequence, motorized tra<U+FB03>c then increases and leads to subsequent
higher risk perception, also for parents of children who walk or cycle. In
addition, household interactions such as parents' work travel patterns
likewise play an important role (e.g. McDonald, 2008).
Parents however often do not take into account that these changes
in children's mobility may result in a negative impact on the child's
personal development (Hüttenmoser, 2004, 2006). Moreover, the ex-
periences which children and youth gain on their trips hardly a<U+FB00>ect
only their future travel behaviour (Limbourg et al., 2000; Hurrelmann,
1998; Moczek and Rambow, 2004). That is, less AIM in<U+FB02>uences a child's

human being (BMLFUW, 2005; Hillman, 2006). AIM is crucial for the
development of psychomotor and cognitive abilities, such as spatial
orientation, perception and estimation of distances, time and speed
(Limbourg, 2006). Children with car-dependent lives can also su<U+FB00>er
from a learning de<U+FB01>ciency, a slower development of social behaviour,
missing balance or spatial awareness (Zimmer, 2003; Limbourg, 2010).
Schützhofer et al. (2015) state that a child with su<U+FB03>cient physical ac-
tivity in his/her daily life will subsequently have well-trained balanced
senses, and will thus be able to deal with critical situations when, for
example, he/she is cycling on the road. Furthermore, a child with good
motor skills can rely on a higher level of awareness of road tra<U+FB03>c. Both
may ultimately lead to a lower risk of children being injured in a tra<U+FB03>c
accident.
As mentioned above, actual and representative studies on the in-
dependent mobility of children are lacking in Austria. In particular, no
comparable studies exist on mobility licenses as conducted by Shaw
et al. (2015) or Hillman et al. (1990). The nationwide household travel
survey of 2013/2014 (Tomschy et al., 2016) includes an unweighted
sample of 444 trips (one reporting day) on the part of 163 6-to-9 year-
old children living in Vienna. Although the survey does not o<U+FB00>er any
information about accompaniment on trip level, key mobility <U+FB01>gures
can nevertheless be derived. Modal split data on school trips of Austrian
primary school children were collected between 2013 and 2017 in the
context of a consulting programme for educational institutions
(Klimaaktiv homepage, 2017). As only those schools were involved
which were interested in the mobility management program, the data
might well be biased. In an individual study on children's mobility in
2000, data on parents were collected at nine primary schools in dif-
ferent Austrian provinces (three schools in Vienna, N = 220) (Sigl and
Weber, 2002). The results show that children from Vienna are less
mobile than children from small towns or rural areas. Most of them
(80%) travel less than 1 km to their primary school. A high share of
children is escorted by car due to the fact that parents judge the tra<U+FB03>c
situation to be too dangerous for independent travel. On trips to school,
every second child is always accompanied. The results reveal that un-
supervised play in the vicinity of the residential environment is not
possible because play areas are di<U+FB03>cult to access or displaced by car
tra<U+FB03>c. Although the study o<U+FB00>ers useful information about independent
mobility, some aspects remain unclear from a methodological per-
spective, as the questionnaire has not been published. For example,
how accompaniment is de<U+FB01>ned or how reasons for accompaniment are
collected. No trip diaries were used; mobility licenses were not sur-
veyed. Overall, comparability with the present study is therefore lim-
ited.
Further individual studies focus on children of kindergarten (e.g.
Ausserer et al., 2010) or older age groups (e.g. Stark et al., 2014, 2015;
Füssl et al., 2012).
This study explores characteristics of children's AIM in their ev-
eryday mobility and the attendant underlying reasons. In this context,
children's behavioral characteristics are linked to parent's attitudes.
Two primary schools in Vienna are used as an example. Although our
two-step survey does not claim representativeness, the methodological
approach and results presented in this paper are expected to be useful
for transport researchers, urban planners, as well as municipal autho-
rities when planning campaigns to strategically promote physical ac-
tivity amongst this important target group.

3. Methods

3.1. Approach and survey instruments

We conducted a two-stage survey in two primary schools in the city
of Vienna. To measure and examine characteristics of AIM, the <U+FB01>rst
stage contained a paper-and-pencil survey investigating the children's
mobility behaviour on two days (one weekday, one weekend day). In
the second stage, parents were invited to take part in an in-depth face-

to-face-interview which aimed at involving the one parent <U+FB01>lling in the
trip diary beforehand as well as the child. The survey documents were
distributed in all school classes and collected again over the following
weeks. All children were approached during the same survey period
between mid of October and mid of November 2013. The following in-
depth face-to-face interviews were conducted in early 2014. Table 1
gives an overview of all sections of the two-step survey which are de-
scribed in the following.
The paper-and-pencil survey consisted of two questionnaires. The base-
line questionnaire contained questions about the household in general (e.g.
home address, number of adults and children in the household, age and
gender of the child for which the trip diary was <U+FB01>lled in). Data about the
parents' occupation and the number of vehicles in the household were
collected. Mobility licenses were enquired about using the approach by
Hillman et al. (1990). In comparison to other studies (e.g. Kyttä et al.,
2015), we only asked parents about the licenses, not the children. As only
one reference weekday was covered in the trip diary, the general fre-
quency of accompaniment on school trips (to and from school) was also
collected. Further questions were asked to obtain information on mobility
habits, i.e. the frequency of use of travel modes was examined for each
parent and child. Furthermore, the child's frequency of bicycle use during

his/her leisure time and to school during spring/summer time in good
weather was asked in order to check for the possibility of seasonally-
skewered bicycle use given in the trip diary. The last page contained the

invitation for an in-depth interview. Whereas the baseline questionnaire
could be <U+FB01>lled in by the parents alone, the trip diary had to be completed
together with the child.

We used a travel diary principally based on the KONTIV-format

(Brög et al., 1983) to collect mobility data on the children. The ques-
tionnaire was adapted according to our research questions. In doing so,
we collected the travel modes used in a given trip in the order of their
usage (trip stages). Trip stages were used as the basic unit for gaining

detailed information on duration, accompanying persons (supervisors,
friends etc.) and the necessity for supervision.

The answers given by the written questionnaires provided the basis

for the in-depth face-to-face interviews which were customized to the
respondents' speci<U+FB01>c situations. As determinants of children's AIM are
very complex, we tried to understand the principles behind existing
mobility patterns. For that reason, we used a semi-structured ques-
tionnaire containing mainly open-ended questions. Based on the trips

stated in the travel diary, trip-speci<U+FB01>c reasons for accompaniment and
mode choice for each speci<U+FB01>c trip were collected in the introductory
part. In this regard, we asked the child why he/she travelled together
with another person(s) (supervisors, friends etc.) or why the child tra-
velled alone in this speci<U+FB01>c situation. We also tried to <U+FB01>nd out what
reasons caused the parents or the child to choose the travel mode(s) for
the given trip.
Further guiding questions referred to children's allowances and the
subjective perception of tra<U+FB03>c and social safety. Parents' attitudes re-
garding AIM were investigated, as well as their viewpoint on their own
responsibility to act as a role model by using active travel modes
whenever possible (see Fig. 1). Additionally, some attitudinal indicators
were collected quantitatively through closed-ended questions. This re-
fers to indicators which were as independent as possible from one's own
child's age or trip length. Parents reported their general attitudes with
regard to social and tra<U+FB03>c safety (for example per travel mode) or their
attitude towards the most appropriate age for independent travel using
<U+FB01>ve-point assessment scales. Discussions and quantitative indicators are
used to point out disparities in parental attitudes.
Based on the information collected, we explored whether attitudinal
di<U+FB00>erences <U+23AF> expressed in parental “pro<U+FB01>les” <U+23AF> manifest themselves in
children's travel patterns, particularly, in indicators of children's AIM.

3.2. The setting

Two public schools were selected to cover di<U+FB00>erent organisational

types (half-day and all-day school) and di<U+FB00>erent locations in the out-
skirts of the city of Vienna. Due to budget constraints, it was not pos-
sible to consider more than two schools for our survey.


School A is a standard, half-day primary school. It is located in the
19th district of Vienna and is surrounded by very dense settlement

structures of multilevel residential constructions of a high re-
sidential quality from the pre-war era. Two tramway lines pass close
to the school; the next bus stop is within 10 min walking distance.
Children who use public transport for their school trips have to cross
several streets in the process. Although there is a marked pedestrian
crossing and a tra<U+FB03>c-calmed street (30 km/h-zone) in front of the
school building, high tra<U+FB03>c volumes and a high demand for parking
spaces in the vicinity of the school can be observed.
School B is an all-day primary school. This means that compulsory
education and further courses take place throughout the day until at
least 3:30 p.m.; childcare is provided until 5:30 p.m. Children from
this school mainly reside in the 22nd district of Vienna with a lower
population density compared to the 19th district (Fig. O-A 1). In the

immediate surroundings of school B, there are tall o<U+FB03>ce buildings of
the post-war era to the west, as well as a suburb area to the east on
the other side of the Old Danube. The school is situated directly at a
six-lane city entrance road (Annual average daily tra<U+FB03>c of 36,000

motor vehicles; Verkehrsplanung Käfer GmbH, 2010); this leads
many parents to drop o<U+FB00> their children on their way to work in
Vienna's city centre. Due to the less central location, the level of
motorization within the pick-up area of school B is generally higher
compared to School A (Fig. O-A 2). To consider these aspects in the
sample, we collected information on the vehicle ownership and the
overall car use by the mother and father.

In summary, the two primary schools of di<U+FB00>erent organisational
types located in di<U+FB00>erent areas in Vienna provide data which enable us
to derive fundamental insight on di<U+FB00>erent determinants of AIM, in-
cluding parental decision-making patterns, although the sample is not
large enough for extracting generalizations about the entire population.

3.3. The sample

In sum, 380 questionnaires were distributed. Table 2 shows a
summary of sample characteristics. The response rate was much higher
at School B (58% vs. 41%). This can be explained by the strong support
of School B's principal who distributed an additional cover letter en-
couraging the parents' participation. In sum, 1,052 trips and 1,583 trip
stages from 190 children (49% girls) were collected. The age distribu-
tion in School A (mean 7.5) and School B (mean 7.8) is almost identical
with a slight surplus of the oldest age group in School B at the expense
of the children aged 6. Those six children aged 10 were assigned to age
group 9. In 37 cases of the 190 returned questionnaires, parents stated
that they were willing to take part in a face-to-face interview. 12 of
those parents were not able to actually take part in the interview, the
main reasons for which being insu<U+FB03>cient contact information, such as
incorrect or partly illegible information of the telephone number or e-
mail address and lack of response to contact. The net sample consisted
of 25 parents – 40% were parents of a daughter. In 80% of the cases,
children took part in the in-depth interview. Table 2 shows some
household characteristics of the sample. There is a low rate of un-
employed mothers at School B, since the working status is one pre-
condition for being accepted into this all-day school. The average
number of persons per household is similar, along with the vehicle
ownership status.

3.4. Analysis methods

The quantitative data of the baseline questionnaire and travel diary
were recorded in a database. Data analysis was performed using IBM
SPSS Version 21 software. For the aggregation of mode choice from
stage to trip level, a usual fundamental de<U+FB01>nition of a hierarchical
structure was used (BMVIT, 2011). Following the preliminary study
design model by Mayring (2001), parental attitudes were analysed
based on (i) qualitative content analysis using transcripts of the in-
depth interviews and quantitative indicators, and by (ii) linking the
results subsequently to the data on children's actual travel behaviour by
means of bivariate analyses.

4. Results

4.1. Indicators of active and independent mobility (AIM)

4.1.1. Mode choice
The modal split strongly depends on the trip purpose and school site
respectively its catchment area: children at School A demonstrated a
higher share of walking trips (47.0%) at the expense of car use (24.4%)
than school B (23.2% walking, 38.1% car passenger) (Table 3). One
main reason for that is the shorter average trip distance in School A,
which is 1.8 km for trips to school (School B: 2.7 km) and 5.5 km for
other trips (School B: 7.6 km). Longer average trip distances cause more
complex trips at School B: 29% of the children's local travels involve
more than one trip stage (19% School A). A disaggregated analysis of
the modal split based on trip stages <U+23AF>which depicts the share of active
mobility in children's travel behaviour more accurately <U+23AF> shows that the
share of pedestrian children in School B (44%) does not vary that
widely from those of School A (55%) in contrast to the trip-based modal
split. Because of the longer average trip distance, children of School B
thus have a lower chance of trips featuring non-stop walking. The share
of cycling is low at both sites which can also be attributed to the survey
timing in autumn. However, 80% of the parents stated that their child
never uses the bicycle on the way to school regardless of the weather or
season. In leisure time, cycling is an option for joint family excursions

(60%), but not in the urban area. Compared to the modal split of
children based on the data of the Austrian household survey2 (car use
36.3%, public transport 22.3%, bicycle 3.4%, walking 38.0%), our
sample shows lower shares of car use in favour of public transport and
bicycle use. This re<U+FB02>ects the selection of our sample in the outskirts of
Vienna.
Relating mode choice to trip purpose, a conspicuous fact stands out,
namely, that children walk more on trips to school compared to trips
with other destinations3. Overall, no signi<U+FB01>cant dependencies on
gender and age could be found. The <U+FB01>nding on gender is in line with
other studies (e.g. Potoglou and Arslangulova, 2017; Pojani and
Boussauw, 2014; D'Haese et al., 2011). No relation of mode choice or
age was con<U+FB01>rmed by Sigl and Weber, 2002.
In the results, the in<U+FB02>uence of the school location becomes clearly

visible: Children from School B have longer school trip distances re-

sulting in higher shares of car use as a passenger. They also have longer
non-school-related trip distances. The higher motorization in the
catchment area of School B is not re<U+FB02>ected in the number of motorized
vehicles per household, but in the families' car use, which is much
higher in families from School B than from School A (mother F = 2.5,
df = 1, p = 0.118; father F = 4.8, df = 1, p = 0.030; child F = 7.0,
df = 1, p = 0.009). A look at the parents' travel patterns revealed that
parents from School A walk on longer distances signi<U+FB01>cantly more often
than from School B (mother F = 31.7, df = 1, p = 0.000; father
F = 16.5, p = 0.000; child F = 26.2, df = 1, p = 0.000). This may re-
sult from the dense urban settlement structure of School A's catchment
area. The children's modal split correlates strongly with their parents'
mode choice. The correlation is stronger for the mother than for the
father, with both correlations showing high signi<U+FB01>cance across all
modes (see Appendix Table A2). This is plausible, since – generally – a
gender gap in childcare indeed exists (Scheiner, 2016). It should be
emphasized that these results are based on general information re-
ported by the parents, not on travel diaries.


4.1.2. Mobility licenses
Fig. 2 shows the mobility licenses by age which are collected within
the baseline questionnaire. Signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences emerge between the
age groups (F = 14.9, df = 4, p = 0.000); mobility licenses increase
with age. This corresponds to results of similar studies in Germany
(Frauendienst and Redecker, 2011), Finland (Kyttä et al., 2015) and
other countries (Shaw et al., 2015). Licenses for going out after dark,
cycling on main roads alone and using buses alone are least prevalent.
This result corresponds to the international study on children's in-
dependent mobility (Shaw et al., 2015).

Findings of previous studies (e.g. Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008) show that mode
choice by children can di<U+FB00>er depending on the direction (home-to-school trips vs. school-
to-home trips). Hence, in our study, school trips are de<U+FB01>ned as home- school relations.

Fig. 2. Mobility licenses by age, reported by parents (n = 141), (*p < 0.01,

**p < 0.001).


The mean scores of mobility licenses of the two school locations do not
di<U+FB00>er for the most part. However, a detailed look revealed that children of
School A have a signi<U+FB01>cantly higher license in crossing main roads alone
(F = 8.6, df = 1, p = 0.004) and in traveling home from school alone
(F = 12.5, df = 1, p = 0.001), although younger children are slightly
overrepresented. We were also able to <U+FB01>nd out that children from School A
tend to have higher licenses at a younger age. This may be due to the fact
that trips from children of School A are generally shorter. However, the
bivariate correlation of allowances and average trip distance at the in-
dividual level is not signi<U+FB01>cant (rs = -0.18, p=0.214). There is a slight
tendency indicating that the higher the allowances, the lower the fre-
quency of accompaniment (rs = -0.25, p = 0.064). This cannot be ob-
served for children from School B, where no relationship between allow-
ances and trip distance (rs = 0.09, p = 0.080) or frequency of
accompaniment (rs = -0.06, p = 0.207) exists.
Apart from age, the working status of the parents seems to have an
in<U+FB02>uence. That is, the mobility license score increases with the mother's
employment rate (not employed, part-time, and full-time). This means
that children of mothers employed full-time have higher allowances
than children from unemployed mothers or mothers employed part-
time. This e<U+FB00>ect only occurred for School A. A similar e<U+FB00>ect was re-
ported by Kyttä et al. (2015) and seems to be plausible because children
at half-day schools have to be more self-organized if parents are at work
during the day. For children at all-day schools, it is not relevant if
parents work the whole day or not. However, this e<U+FB00>ect does not occur
in terms of the working status of the father. No signi<U+FB01>cant connections
to gender can be found.
As no earlier study in Austria on mobility licenses exists, only a com-
parison with other existing individual studies in an international context is

possible. However, the di<U+FB00>erent frameworks have to be considered.

Whereas our study is conducted in a big city, the surveyed areas in UK and

Germany comprised “a range of (…) geographies” (Shaw et al., 2015,

p15). Five schools of di<U+FB00>erent areas in England and Germany were chosen
to provide a cross-sectional snapshot of the countries. However, the

were made primarily because they had to accompany their parents due

literature, the individual perception of tra<U+FB03>c and social safety of var-
ious travel modes play an important role in parents' argumentation. In
this regard, parents di<U+FB00>er in their mention of fear, supervision and
control. In the discussions, some parents strongly emphasize the com-
patibility with their daily routines –whilst some of them less so. Their
individual perception of AIM bene<U+FB01>ts for the child (e.g. in terms of
health) turns out to be a factor when it comes to AIM-related decision
making. It became clear that for some of the interviewees, one im-
portant aspect is the parents' self-image or, more precisely, how they
de<U+FB01>ne their role model function in this context and how they re<U+FB02>ect on
their responsibility to promote these issues. Based on the attitudinal
di<U+FB00>erences, three pro<U+FB01>les of parents emerged, which we named (i)
Promoters, (ii) Pragmatists and (iii) Protectors (“P-types”). They are
characterized as follows:
Promoters encourage their children to engage in independent mo-
bility very early on; they try to practise AIM as often as possible. “(…) if
they [children] want to travel somewhere, you can support them by ex-
plaining the routes (…) or by ensuring that they travel in a group - if they
[trips] are longer. There is no need to escort them.” With regard to walking
and cycling, they often mention the bene<U+FB01>t of the positive health im-
pact. These parents try to be a role model, use the bicycle often for their
everyday travel, and try to avoid car use. “We go for a walk regularly,
cycling, hiking, we make a lot [actively].” “I walk a lot with the kids (…) I
attach great importance to that.” “In my opinion, ‘city children’ do not walk
enough. (…) Sometimes we directly walk home from the metro station
[instead of using the bus].” “One must train the children even more [if there
is a hazardous area]. This concerns parents with their role model function.”
It is noticeable that they often make generalized statements (“parents
should”, “one should”), for example: “One must give the matter [of pro-
moting AIM] some thought.” “One really can support them by training the
routes.” “Of course, parents have to play their part, this is very clear. What
they [parents] do not exemplify, does not last.”
They describe walking and public transport as safe modes of travel
in terms of social and tra<U+FB03>c safety. Promoters see tra<U+FB03>c and mobility
education not primarily as a task of the school; they feel responsible for
taking charge of it themselves. Some of them also point out that it is or
must be feasible for parents to promote AIM independent of challenging
everyday situations (e.g. time constraints). “Sometimes I try to organise
the daily routines in such a way that she can travel alone for the last part of
the journey.” In this context, Promoters mention <U+FB02>exibility in working
hours. They trust their children to be out on their own in the residential
environment and foster their children's freedom of action and choice. In
that sense, it seems to be important that their children learn to take
responsibility on their trips from an early age, such as the following
parents reported: “I try to motivate her to walk on her own – on trips she
knows well and where I trust her.” “Sometimes, when I pick him up (…) I
ask him if we should drive or walk.” “We practice the trips until it really
works.” “I don't hold his hand, I try [to help him] that he <U+FB01>nds his way by
himself. [I] let his hand go step by step.” “We taught her to go by scooter,
bicycle (…); she can decide by herself.” “[With regard to independent travel
of children:] They need to have an immediate sense of achievement. Then the
<U+FB01>rst step has been made.”
Meanwhile, Pragmatists particularly emphasize that they try to re-
concile their own trip chains and the promotion of AIM for their chil-
dren. They point out that making decisions on travel accompaniment
and travel modes on their children's trips in an appropriate, functional
and time-saving manner. They justify car use with time constraints,
stress and a low compatibility of shuttling back and forth with the
household duties. “We have a lot of errands to run. We have to use the car
for organisational and temporal reasons. We have to use it to enable active
recreational programmes [for the child]. This sounds contradictory, in fact.”
They often allow their children to travel independently to school or to
leisure activities, but pick them up afterwards by car and take the
children along on errands. They like to use non-motorized modes for
joint weekend excursions. However, active mobility in daily travel only

takes place under certain conditions. Their deliberate attempt to

promote independent mobility often ends with a compromise.
Pragmatists often describe inner con<U+FB02>icts: “It is very di<U+FB03>cult for me, since
actually it [independent mobility] would be very important for me (…).”
The third group, the Protectors, usually chooses the car for their own
trips, and tend to have a negative attitude towards public transport.
Their children are mainly escorted by car and have consequently little
chance of experiencing independent mobility at the primary school age,
demonstrated by the following example of one father: “[…] it would
never have happened that he [son] would have taken public transport [to
ride to school]. Firstly, because he is not familiar with it since we never tried
it out and [secondly] we [parents] ourselves only get around by car.”
Another parent states: “I do not yet promote [her] independent mobility, it
is like that, that you even have to work actively against it, because she would
like to do it on her own.” Their children's independent travel is seen as
less important. Protectors emphasise tra<U+FB03>c safety and comfort as rea-
sons for escorting their children. They assess the social safety of walking
and public transport to be rather low. It seems that they want to justify
themselves in their respective decisions using “self-centred” statements.
It also appears that they have the need to always feel fully in control:
“There [inside the car] he [son] has his child seat … he is strapped, there, I
know, he is stored securely. There is always the chance that something might
go wrong, however, inside the car – that is the safest.” Another parent
states: “I can't promote it [cycling], because, you know, there are crowds of
people. That's dangerous.” In this context, parents also mention low
con<U+FB01>dence in their children's abilities to travel independently; a mother
reported: “I try to observe how they behave. I let them walk short trips by
themselves (…) they are issued with mobile phones.” In contrast to
Promoters, Protectors seem to be also very restrictive when letting
children playing outdoors without supervision. Talking about their
children's <U+FB01>rst experiences of traveling independently, a particularly
conspicuous aspect is that Protectors mention a comparatively higher
age, often starting at secondary school.
Based on their statements, nearly all of the parents could be as-
signed to one of the three groups. To verify this assignment and to cope
with unclear cases, we considered quantitative information which was
collected complementarily within the interviews. For example, parents'
mode-speci<U+FB01>c attitudes with regards to tra<U+FB03>c and social safety were
considered (complete list of 14 indicators, see Table A3). For these
attitudinal indicators, the scales were standardized to derive a <U+FB01>nal “P-
score” re<U+FB02>ecting the parents' tendency to promote a child's AIM (from 1
to 5). By our de<U+FB01>nition, a high P-score indicates rather promoting at-
titudes, whilst low scores indicate rather protective attitudes. Based on
the individual P-scores, a <U+FB01>nal assignment of each parent was made
(Table 4). As a result, in our sample, 9 parents belong to the group of
Promoters, 9 to Pragmatists, and 7 to Protectors. All P-types can be ob-
served at each school location. This suggests that the P-type is not solely
a matter of the school location and respective residential location. Al-
though the sample size is very low, we found the tendency that parents
of older children are rather Promoters. Examining single age classes,
however, indicates the existence of di<U+FB00>erent P-types for same-aged
children. In terms of trip distance, the in<U+FB02>uence is inconclusive. For
school trip distances, longer trips seem to favour Protectors, yet this does
not apply for the overall average trip distance. The absolute level of trip
distance related to one P-type nevertheless varies between the schools.
In order to analyse the impact of parental attitudes on children's
mobility behaviour, in a next step, data collected in the quantitative
survey were linked to the results of the in-depth interviews. As a result,
bivariate analyses were carried out depicting the following indicators
describing the nature and extent of the child's independent and active
travel behaviour: (i) overall mobility licence score, (ii) share of ac-
companied trip stages, (iii) share of walking, (iv) share of car use, (v)
independent action radius at residential location4 and (vi) average
weekly duration of unsupervised outdoor playtime4. The scales of these
