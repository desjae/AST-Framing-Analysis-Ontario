can be affected by many factors, including their own self-esteem, perceived road safety, active travel and
independent mobility, amongst other factors. Cities should plan for neighbourhoods that are safer for
children to use, socialise and travel in, for the sake of promoting children’s wellbeing.

1. Background                                                                         and Loo, 2014; Waygood and Kitamura, 2009; Harten and Olds,
2004; Armstrong, 1993).
‘Mobility’ refers to ‘‘[t]he ability to move or be moved freely and                   Very much intertwined with mobility, the concept of ‘‘wellbe-

world, but whether this holds true in an East Asian context is not
well studied. Also, whether independent and active travel amongst
primary school children is associated with more positive evalua-
tive wellbeing (e.g. life satisfaction) remains to be examined in
both the western and East Asian contexts. This study also intro-
duces a fresh perspective in investigating children’s scheduled
activities and associated travels, in addition to the more typical
studies that only discuss journeys to and from school. Investigation
of children’s scheduled activities are an important complement to
the general children’s mobility literature. This study thus serves as
the starting point to fill in these research gaps, in order to better
understand the different dimensions of active and independent
travel of children. This study also investigates how children’s travel
characteristics, amongst other key factors, affect wellbeing of chil-
dren, in experiential (momentary) and evaluative (overall) terms.
This study draws upon the above literature to examine the
question of whether higher levels of mobility and autonomy for
children have any effect on attitudinal measures of psychological
wellbeing, through the children’s lens. Through questionnaire sur-
veys, it is possible to consider how children rate different experi-
ences (momentary wellbeing) and evaluate the domains of
school and life in general (overall wellbeing), via the concept of
‘‘happiness”. It is easier for primary school students to understand
and describe how ‘‘happy” they are, instead of relatively more dif-
ficult concepts such as ‘‘satisfaction” or ‘‘wellbeing”. Furthermore,
children’s own perceptions of their surroundings and self-
confidence in daily life provide a voice for the children themselves,
such as in previous work by Page et al. (2010) and Tonucci and
Rissotto (2001). Children’s perspectives are important and deserve
more research and recognition. Parents have considerable influ-
ence over their child’s travel, so listening directly to the child’s
views, as this study intends, provides an opportunity for adults
to work towards improving children’s psychological wellbeing
with a better comprehension of children’s own perceived capabil-
ities and preferences.
Age is a major factor in influencing levels of independent mobil-
ity among children, and is often a determinant of when children
are ready to safely navigate the street network and neighbourhood
environment alone (e.g. Fyhri et al., 2011; Lam and Loo, 2014). The




Fig. 1. Conceptual model for

concept of mobility licences was first proposed by Hillman et al.
(1990) to identify when parents would allow their children to do
certain things outside of home independently, such as to cross
roads, go out after dark, leave school, etc. Parental perceptions on
neighbourhood safety and belief in their child’s ability to navigate
these potential hazards have already been shown to greatly influ-
ence children’s travel behaviour (Susilo and Liu, 2015; Waygood
and Susilo, 2015; Alparone and Pacilli, 2012; Panter et al., 2010).
The Italian study by Alparone and Pacilli (2012, p. 113) studied this
as the ‘‘maternal perception of positive potentiality of outdoor
autonomy”, i.e. how the mother decides if her child is ready to nav-
igate the outdoors independently, judged by daily ability to take
care of themselves, being responsible, socialising skills, and other
factors. With parental concerns discussed quite widely in the liter-
ature, this study’s incorporation of children’s own self confidence
and perceptions, as discussed in the above paragraph, is a contribu-
tion to the literature from a novel, understudied angle.
Formulated from the above and based on the Hong Kong con-
text, a conceptual model has been constructed and is shown in
Fig. 1. Conceptually speaking, this study aims to examine children’s
overall wellbeing, in particular their satisfaction with life, with the
factors of 1) children’s socio-demographic characteristics, 2) their
activities, 3) travel behaviour, 4) self-confidence, perceptions and
knowledge and 5) momentary wellbeing. The specific dimensions
marked by asterisks fall within the scope of this study, listed along
with some other important factors that are worth future consider-
ation, though this is by no means an exhaustive list. To be specific,
a list of aims based on the conceptual model is detailed henceforth.
The first aim of this paper is to study children’s travel behaviour for
journeys to and from school and all scheduled activities, among
selected groups of Hong Kong primary school children, and how
the travel characteristics vary for children of different age and gen-
der. The second aim is to understand children’s subjective feelings
of their happiness of different experiences (momentary wellbeing)
and in the domains of school and life in general (overall wellbeing),
in terms of children’s age, gender and travel characteristics. The
third and final aim is to tie all the strings together, in terms of chil-
dren’s socio-demographic characteristics, self-confidence, percep-
tions, travel behaviour and momentary wellbeing. This

contributes to achieving the ultimate aim of this study, which is to
understand the predictors of children’s life satisfaction, and point a
possible way forward for policymakers to improve children’s lives
in the East Asian context.


2. Methodology

This paper’s methodology is based mainly on questionnaire sur-
veys, conducted on both children and parents. This was considered
to be the most suitable way to collect data of subjective percep-
tions and feelings across a large number of school children, supple-
mented by data on their school travel characteristics provided by
their parents. Through using a variety of question types, such as
multiple choice, ordered category items and semantic differential
ratings, the questionnaire surveys provided respondents with the
opportunity to convey their views within a reasonably structured
format.
The child questionnaires were administered by a team of
trained research assistants via face-to-face interviews with chil-
dren at their schools. Data were collected about 1) their subjective
feelings of wellbeing in their travel and daily life, conceptualised
under the umbrella of ‘‘happiness”, which can be easily understood
by children, 2) questions regarding confidence in self-care ability
and perception of road-crossing safety in Hong Kong and 3) the
duration, number, type and travel characteristics of their sched-
uled activities. Data with respect to children’s reported ‘‘happi-
ness” were measured across five items of momentary wellbeing,
namely happiness during 1) the journey to school, 2) the journey
from school, 3) physical education (PE) lesson, 4) computer games
and 5) outdoor play and two items of overall wellbeing, namely
happiness with 1) school overall and 2) life in general. The ques-
tions were asked beginning ‘‘How happy are you in the following
situations?” and children answered along a ten-point semantic dif-
ferential scale, with ‘‘very happy” and ‘‘very unhappy” at 1 and 10
respectively. Difficult language was avoided in order to enable chil-
dren to easily understand the question. Apart from ‘‘affective expe-
rience” of children during travel, previously explored in the
literature (e.g. Westman et al., 2013; Romero, 2015), this study
design incorporated the proposition that PE lessons, computer
games and outdoor play with friends and classmates may also be
sources of fun, enjoyment and happiness (O’Reilly et al., 2001;
Alexander et al., 2015). Questions regarding self-care ability and
perception of road-crossing safety in Hong Kong, on the other
hand, were answered along a 5-point scale of ordered categories,
with ‘‘strongly agree” and ‘‘strongly disagree” at either end. The
parent questionnaire was distributed to all child participants’ par-
ents, asking them to report their child’s travel characteristics in
journeys to/ from school. The data from both the child and parent
questionnaires together have enabled subsequent statistical analy-
sis of reported measures of wellbeing along key variables such as
age, gender and travel behaviour. The collected data correspond
with the three major aims of this study, and provide a thorough
understanding of primary school children’s own views.

The study’s focus on primary school children is chiefly due to
practical considerations. It is the most obvious arena for in-depth

investigation of a wide variation of children – who are still at an

early stage of learning and development – by key variables such

as gender, age, household background and neighbourhood charac-

teristics. They would otherwise be difficult to investigate in a non-
school environment. This study may also serve as a starting point
for future school-based education programmes that encourage
increased walking to school and increased children’s independent

mobility, while taking into consideration their psychological well-

being. To include students of different demographic, household
and neighbourhood backgrounds, invitation letters were sent to

60 randomly selected Hong Kong primary schools per batch in
the 1) fully government-financed (government and aided) and 2)
non-fully government financed (Direct Subsidy Scheme, English
Schools Foundation, Private Independent School scheme and pri-
vate) primary school categories, using the official list of schools
in Hong Kong as published by the Education Bureau (2013).
After three batches of initial contacting by mail in category 1
and two batches in category 2, one school from each category
responded positively. The study, therefore, included one
Cantonese-medium government aided school (category 1) and
one English-medium English Schools Foundation school (category
2). Fieldwork was carried out over five days from November
2015 to January 2016. Invitation letters were sent to all students’
parents in both schools prior to the respective survey days in order
to indicate whether consent would be given for their children to
participate in the study. The survey respondents consisted of 393
students from the two schools, with around 35 students per grade
from Primary 1 to 6 (roughly six to twelve years old) during the
survey days by a team of trained research assistants.


3. Results and discussion

3.1. School and associated journeys

School travel data were provided by children’s parents
(n = 281), describing their child’s travel mode, time taken and
accompaniment in their journeys from home to school and
back. This sub-section shall thoroughly discuss children’s school
travel, in terms of active and independent travel, travel mode
and travel time, which contributes to the understanding of
children’s travel behaviour with respect to their age and gender.
Children’s wellbeing in both momentary and overall terms is
also discussed with respect to their school travel characteristics,
in order to better understand their interrelationships in
descriptive terms.
For continuity and better understanding of the effect of possible
after-school play and other activities on happiness ratings, the
whole journey associated with children’s travel from school to
return back home is analysed, as shown in Tables 1–3 below. From
Table 1, school bus was the main transport mode, for 39% of chil-
dren. This was followed closely by walking at 28% and bus (includ-
ing minibus) at 10%. Rail, ferry and car had around 7–8% of the
share each. Happiness ratings of their journeys departing school
was the highest for ferry (8.84), followed by walking (8.47) and
school bus (8.13). Students travelling from school back home by
bus/ minibus (7.90) rated their journeys as less happy, and lower
still were travellers by rail and car (both 7.64).
After the above overview of travel modes and happiness partic-
ular to the journey departing school, the discussion is expanded to
happiness ratings in terms of both momentary and overall

wellbeing. Using the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the means
of happiness ratings grouped by active versus motorised travel in
their journey departing school, some enlightening results were
found, as shown in Table 2. The main consideration for using the
Mann-Whitney U test was to use a more lenient, non-parametric
test which does not assume normality and is able to accommodate
for variables where normality is uncertain, with various applica-
tions in transportation studies, especially in terms of travel-
related perceptions/ attitudinal measures along a rated scale (e.g.
Xu et al., 2009; Minhans et al., 2014; Dallen, 2007). Happiness rat-
ings were higher nearly all across the board, in particular with hap-
piness in PE class and when playing outdoors with friends, both
significant to the p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 levels respectively. While
not definitive across all happiness items, children engaging in
walking journeys to depart school rated their journeys happier
than compared with those departing school by motorised modes.
These walking children also found more enjoyment in active pur-
suits. This is in line with findings by Romero (2015) and
Ramanathan et al. (2014), which found that children who walked

for school travel had more positive moods.
For companionship, as seen in Table 3, the vast majority (nearly
90%) of children were accompanied by adults during some or the
entire part of their journeys departing school, with 63% of these

children being accompanied by their parents or bus drivers/ nan-
nies. Happiness ratings were the lowest for children with indepen-
dent travel, though it is important to note that there were very few
such children, and nearly half of them were in the 11- to 12-year-

old category. Again using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney

U test, the comparison of means testing was inconclusive
(p = 0.186), and further testing with other happiness ratings with
presence of independent mobility on the school-home journey also
yielded no significant results. However, it is still intriguing to note
that independent travellers seem to be less happy on their school
journeys than their adult-accompanied counterparts. This is a
pathway worth exploring in future studies, as the psychological
wellbeing of children during travel is still understudied. For exam-
ple, children rated their journeys on school buses quite highly,
which may indicate a preference for children to be with other stu-
dents of the same school. This interaction is possible on a school
bus journey, but not if the child is, for example, driven directly
home by his or her parents, or if he or she walks home alone.

Finally, regarding travel time in Table 4, students on average
spent 27–30 min one way for school-associated travels, with girls
travelling slightly longer. Travel duration did appear to differ by
age but revealed no particular pattern. School travel time for the
selected participants in this study are around double the one-
way average travel time, at 13 and 14 min, for primary school chil-
dren in the United Kingdom and Queensland, Australia respectively
(National Travel Survey, 2014; Department of Transport and Main
Roads, 2012). While this study does not claim to represent charac-
teristics of Hong Kong-wide school travel, the figure of 27–30 min
corresponds relatively well with Hong Kong’s figure of 38 min from
the Transport Department (2014) for home-based travel to school
(inclusive of all full-time students, regardless of primary, sec-
ondary or other levels of education).


3.2. Scheduled activities and associated journeys


With scheduled activities being a common part of Hong Kong

children’s daily lives, an analysis of the type, number and associ-

ated travel of children’s scheduled activities is another important

aspect of this study, along with the relationship with children’s tra-

vel behaviour. This sub-section complements the previous discus-

sion about school travel, in terms of understanding children’s

scheduled activities by age and gender, while at the same time

considering their associated travel behaviour. Scheduled activities

are becoming more common in increasingly urbanised and high-

pressure global cities with a large middle-class segment, and with

Hong Kong as one of the more extreme examples (Karsten, 2014),
this study provides a lesser studied dimension for understanding
children’s travel behaviour.
The scheduled activities and associated travel were self-
reported by children, and further categorised based on the
Education Bureau’s (2012) scheduled activity typology, namely 1)
academic, 2) sports, 3) art, 4) interest/ hobby and 5) service. Table 5
shows some examples of these out-of-home activities that sur-
veyed children took part in.
Categorised using the above typology, Tables 6–8 describe
activities that the child respondents participated in with respect
to the activity type, activity duration and associated travel charac-
teristics, such as travel time and presence of adult accompaniment.
From Table 6, it is evident that walking was the main associated
travel mode for close to two fifths of the total number of the chil-
dren’s scheduled activities, closely followed by private car at just

under a quarter, bus/ minibus at 17% and rail at 12%. In this respect,
though active travel is only associated with 38% of children’s activ-

ities, there are over three quarters of the activities where the chil-

dren (often with one or both their parents) walk or take public

transport to attend these scheduled activities.

Table 7 shows that the vast majority of children’s activities –

over four fifths – had associated travel accompanied by an adult,

with nearly one half of which being the mother. This indicates

the traditional role of the mother being responsible first and fore-

most to taking care of their children, in this case with respect to the

choice of and travel for scheduled out-of-home activities. This is in

line with findings in Karsten’s (2014) small-scale pilot study on
middle-class parents in Hong Kong, where it was acknowledged
that mothers in particular exhibited intensive parenting in ‘‘choos-

ing, communicating and supervising extracurricular activities” (p.
567), and also Holloway and Pimlott-Wilson’s (2014) British study,

which found that especially in middle class families, chauffeuring
children between scheduled activities represented an important

commitment for mothers, and a basis for the child-centred organ-

isation of family time.
Table 8 gives an overview of the scheduled activities by the
number of activities, minutes of activities per week and associated
travel time per week. As a whole, the surveyed children had 2.61
weekly scheduled activities, with 9- to 12-year-olds averaging at
around 3 per week and 5- and 6-year-olds at less than two per

week. In terms of time spent participating in scheduled activities
each week, once again, 9- to 12-year-olds averaged far higher than
their younger schoolmates, at nearly six hours per week. 5- to 8-
year-olds still spent over three hours per week participating in
scheduled activities. Associated travel time was higher for older
students, and understandably so as they would be expected to be


capable of travelling longer distances and begin to become more
independent. Children aged 5–6 reported less than one hour per

and perceptions. The variable describing happiness with life in
general was used as the dependent variable, which was deter-
mined to be normal with its skewness and excess kurtosis within
an acceptable range ( 1.27 and 1.42 respectively). Statistical anal-
ysis by ordinary least squares linear regression was conducted.
Table 11 shows the table of coefficients from the model. Collinear-
ity diagnostics were examined, and the VIF and condition indices
were of no concern. The model summary produced a satisfactory
R2 value of 0.266, which indicates that the model explains nearly
27% of the variability of the model. The p-value of the ANOVA
between group means of independent variables in this model stood
at p < 0.001, which is indicative of a strongly significant result.
From Table 11, momentary wellbeing for school travel, PE les-
sons and outdoor play items were all positive predictors for higher
happiness with life in general, at the p < 0.05 level (p < 0.01 for PE
lessons). The relationship of life satisfaction with momentary well-
being in the computer game item was weakly significant, but with
a negative sign at the p < 0.1 level. This indicates that higher hap-
piness while playing computer games is a weak predictor of poorer
overall wellbeing in terms of life satisfaction. Higher overall self-
care ability and overall perception of road-crossing safety in Hong
Kong were significant predictors for increased happiness of life in
general at the p < 0.1 and p < 0.05 levels respectively. This lends

support to the proposition that children’s increased confidence of
independent self-care ability can heighten satisfaction with life
in general, as can children’s perception of road-crossing in Hong
Kong as a whole to be safe for at-grade navigation.
Parental licence to cross roads, while significant at the p < 0.01
level, was unexpectedly negatively associated with the psycholog-
ical wellbeing of the children. In other words, for children who said
they were allowed more often by their parents to cross roads alone
actually tended to rate their lives as less happy in general. Inciden-
tally, this may also echo with the earlier finding for momentary
wellbeing that children who were accompanied in travel on aver-
age rated those journeys as happier than those travelling indepen-
dently. This may at first glance seem to relate with the effect of age,
as there were more independent travellers in the older age groups.
However, after considering all variables in the model, increased
age was positively associated with overall life satisfaction at the
p < 0.05 level. Perhaps primary school children, regardless of age,
actually prefer to have an adult accompanying them to and from
school.
Finally, as different types of motorised travel may have different
relationships with children’s happiness with life in general, the pri-
mary travel modes for children’s school journeys were analysed
separately using dummy variables in the linear regression model,

instead of a binary analysis of active versus motorised travel
modes. Children using rail transport (mainly MTR) to depart school
were less happy with life in general (significant at the p < 0.05
level) when compared with the reference group of ‘‘walking”. This
may be indicative of rail transport being crowded and uncomfort-
able for children, and the need for modal transfer(s) when the MTR
is used. In contrast, children being picked up from school by car
were happier with life in general (significant to the p < 0.01 level)
when compared with walking. One distinct proposition here may
be that children from wealthier family backgrounds are able to
afford to put their children on school bus service or drive their chil-
dren to/ from school, instead of having their children take the MTR,
and these children happen to rate their lives happier. Ultimately,
whether independent and/ or active travel predict children’s well-
being, as a result of family background and socioeconomic status,
is outside the scope of this study, but would undoubtedly be
worthwhile for researchers to further investigate.
Other variables, such as gender, number of scheduled activities
in a week and independent travel for departing school were not
statistically significant at the p < 0.1 level. However, some of these
results’ directions do give some potential cues for further study.
For example, less weekly number of activities pointed toward pre-
dicting a higher life satisfaction rating. This may illustrate that chil-
dren prefer fewer scheduled activities, perhaps a couple they
actually enjoy. This may serve as a starting point for investigation
with a wider sample of primary school children, to understand the
potential effects of scheduled activities and their associated travel
with self-reported ratings of psychological wellbeing, in addition
to the more usually investigated school travel characteristics, in
order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the com-
plex interplay between children’s mobility, wellbeing and their
own perceptions.

interrelationships. Key findings that represent major contributions
to this study’s aims are summarised hereafter.
Over half of travel associated with scheduled activities and
departing from school were completed mainly on foot or by public
transport. Most children’s journeys were accompanied by adults,
especially for children aged 9 or under. Children’s momentary
wellbeing during travel was investigated, and results revealed hap-
pier school travel for active and accompanied journeys. Children
who walked to depart school rated these journeys considerably
happier than their counterparts who used motorised transport.
Furthermore, children who departed school walking rated PE les-
sons and outdoor play with friends as significantly happier than
their non-walking counterparts. Children travelling accompanied
by adults (particularly school bus drivers/ bus nannies) rated these
journeys happier than their independently travelling counterparts.
Regarding travel behaviour and momentary wellbeing, it seems
that increasing the rate of active travel and keeping the current sta-
tus quo of low independent travel seems to be a viable way for-
ward to improve primary schoolchildren’s momentary wellbeing.
Regarding children’s overall wellbeing, in particular their satis-
faction with life, a linear regression model was used to identify
explanatory factors. Overall, happiness during school travel, PE
and outdoor play, children’s confidence in their self-care ability,
positive perception of road-crossing safety in Hong Kong and being
driven from school by car (relative to walking) were significant
predictors of increased psychological wellbeing. Happiness while
playing computer games with friends, parental licence provision
and using rail to depart school (relative to walking) were negative
predictors. In terms of improving overall psychological wellbeing, a
reasonable way forward may be to continue improving neighbour-
hood road safety in Hong Kong to enable children to feel safer
when using the road network, and also improve children’s self-
esteem via teaching them the skills needed to better take care of
themselves.
In summary, using the conceptual model in Fig. 1, this study
explored the factors behind children’s life satisfaction, namely 1)
age and gender under socio-demographic characteristics, 2) their
school activities and extracurricular activities, 3) dimensions of

104                                                     K.Y.K. Leung, B.P.Y. Loo / Travel


their travel behaviour, 4) their own estimation of self-care ability

and perception of the road environment and 5) both activity-

specific and mobility-specific momentary wellbeing. The concep-
tual framework that this study has proposed allows researchers
to consider the children’s socio-demographic characteristics, their

activities, their travel behaviour, perceptions and momentary well-
being in a holistic manner.
In moving forward, future research may consider complement-

ing children’s own views with parental perception data, focusing
on child-parent differences in the perception of children’s capabil-
ities, for better understanding of children’s mobility and wellbeing.

This would fit under the umbrella of perceptions, attitudes and
knowledge in the conceptual model, which may contribute to
shaping children’s overall wellbeing and life satisfaction. Future

studies may also examine other relevant socio-demographic char-
acteristics and travel behaviour variables as listed in the concep-
tual model, such as children’s residential locations and their

actual travel routes to and from school respectively (Lam and

Loo, 2014). Actual – in addition to perceived – neighbourhood
characteristics may affect when children are granted mobility
licences by parents, and travel behaviour is also likely to be closely

related as well.
Considering the above conclusions and recommendations, it is
hoped that this study may enable policymakers to plan for and reg-

ulate neighbourhoods safe for children to use, socialise and travel
in. Children’s mobility and autonomy interact with wellbeing in a
complex manner. Further research would allow deeper investiga-

tion into the interplay between children’s travel behaviour and
parental concerns, alongside various facets of children’s wellbeing
and development.
