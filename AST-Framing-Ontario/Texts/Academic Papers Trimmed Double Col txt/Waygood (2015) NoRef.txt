can be a strong explanatory factor, it is necessary to consider other
in<U+FB02>uences.
Considering that there is likely some limit to what a reasonable
walking distance is, some papers have used increments of 0.5 miles
[13,14], 0.5 km [15], or categories [16]. Other authors have used
dummy variables based on the average distance deemed walkable by
parents [17]. Some of that research [13,15,17] on why children are driv-
en to school also found that even children who live less than the
smallest increments used (0.5 miles or 0.5 km) were chauffeured by
car. Thus, taking into consideration that this distance might vary be-
tween cultures and that 0.5 miles is not equivalent to 0.5 km
(0.5 miles is roughly 0.8 km), there appears to be a gap in knowledge
about country-speci<U+FB01>c “reasonable” walking distance. Such a threshold
is likely an important explanatory factor in children walking to school.
Thus, though distance is one of the strongest known explanations of
children walking to school, it is not the complete picture. To understand
other in<U+FB02>uences on children's travel some authors have examined the
reasons that parents give as to why their children do or do not walk to
school. When parents are asked why they drive children to school, fre-
quent answers that do not relate to distance are not only often tied to
safety concerns such as fear of child abduction or “stranger danger”
[13,2,18] and traf<U+FB01>c danger [2,19,18], but also the parent's convenience
[13,15,20]. Related to convenience, a parent's usual means of travel
might also explain a child's mode as Susilo and Liu [21] found that a
parent's habit of routinely travelling by non-motorised modes was pos-
itively correlated with children's active travel. In contrast to the study
presented in this paper, those studies were based on transportation sur-
veys examining the problem of children not walking to school, so par-
ents would likely be giving responses to justify why their child is not
doing the preferred behaviour.
The propensity of children to walk to school may also depend on the
quality of the physical environment. Related to traf<U+FB01>c safety, parents in
Australia were concerned about safe crossings and large roads [22]. A
UK study on attitudes towards walking and cycling [23] found that car
culture dominates consideration of mode choice, which was built off
fear and poor perceptions of the physical environment. For Scotland,
the perceived quality of walking was found to be related to deprivation
levels1 of the neighbourhood [24]. That research found that the
measures that in<U+FB02>uenced walking for adults in deprived areas made
less difference in non-deprived areas. However, how neighbourhood
deprivation impacts the propensity of children to travel to school is
still largely unknown.
When a wider consideration of the physical environment is taken,
two relevant studies have been conducted in the UK. The <U+FB01>rst was con-
ducted in Bristol [25] and examined 23 different parental perceptions
related to aesthetics, nuisance, safety, and access to local destinations.
In that study, distance was again the strongest explanatory variable
for active travel (AT) to school, but ease of access to local destinations
was positively associated for boys' AT, while nuisance (based on three
components: crime, noise, and bullying) was negatively associated for
girls.
The second study was conducted in Norfolk, UK [16]. In this study,
parental attitudes and safety concerns, as well as the presence of social
support from parents and friends were associated with AT to school.
However, that study's measures were mostly limited to those related
to traf<U+FB01>c or stranger danger, with the exception of the sense of commu-
nity which was positively associated with walking for trips under 1 km.
Thus, apart from Page et al. [25], the potential for parental perceptions of
general neighbourhood quality has not been well studied.
Other studies have included parental perceptions such as
neighbourhood safety or risk. Perceptions of neighbourhood safety
were not signi<U+FB01>cant in explaining children walking to school in

ic, and housing issues (Scottish Government, 2009).

the USA [26], while Wen et al. [15] found that the perceptions of
neighbourhood and road safety were different between parents of chil-
dren who themselves walked and those who did not. Also in Australia,
Carver et al. [27] found that parents' perceptions of risks in their
neighbourhood were linked to defensive behaviour, which was then
linked to reduced active travel. However, these studies did not consider
other aspects of the neighbourhood such as the overall rating of the
neighbourhood or perceptions of anti-social behaviour that may affect
the general sense of security.
As shown by the discussion above, while parents' perceptions might
in<U+FB02>uence whether children would be allowed to walk to school, it is
largely unknown which perceptions or preferences matter most. It is
important to understand which matter the most in order to design the
most suitable policy intervention.
Using data from the 2006 Scottish Household Survey, this paper ex-
plores whether perceptions of the neighbourhood are related to a child
walking to school. Unlike the previous studies cited above that exam-
ined parent justi<U+FB01>cations for not driving children to school, which pri-
marily focused on traf<U+FB01>c safety and personal security, this research
uses data from a general household survey that, while it includes ques-
tions related to traf<U+FB01>c, children's security, and general safety, it also in-
cludes many other questions such as the quality of local shops and
facilities and community measures such as friendly people, good
neighbours, and community spirit. Thus, it not only examines the safety
component, but also removes the “justi<U+FB01>cation” element in responses,
and expands the research consideration to other qualities of a
neighbourhood and reasons for their household location choice.
The next section will discuss the dataset and methods used in this
paper. The <U+FB01>rst section of the analysis lays down basic <U+FB01>ndings on
modal share and establishes what the “reasonable” walking distance to
school is for children in Scotland. Fifty-nine subjective values by the par-
ents are considered, and those that are signi<U+FB01>cantly correlated with chil-
dren walking to school are then considered in a binary logit model that
includes parents' commitments, their perceive quality of the built envi-
ronment and the traditional characteristics of the built environment.
The paper closes with Section 4 Discussion and Section 5 Conclusions.


2. Material and methods

Data for this research comes from the geographically representative
2005/2006 Scottish Household Survey2 (SHS). It is a continuous cross-
sectional survey with roughly 31,000 households participating over a
two-year period. The survey considers three main policy areas: Housing,
Social Justice and Transport. The survey was designed to provide informa-
tion about the characteristics, attitudes and behaviour of Scottish house-
holds and individuals on a range of issues including transport. Within the
survey, a few questions pertain to one child's mode to school.
For this study, responses from household surveys where the random
child was between the ages of 10 and 11 years were used. Children aged
10 and 11 years old were used for two reasons. The <U+FB01>rst is that this cor-
responds with the age where parents in the UK expect their children to
be able to travel to school independently [28]. Secondly, a considerable
amount of the research on children's travel focuses on children aged 10
and 11, thus this age allows for comparison. The relevant descriptive
variables for the children, their households, and their neighbourhoods
can be seen in Table 1. Unfortunately, variables such as the number of
cars within the household, population density and shop density were
unavailable. Because of the protection of personal identity, geographical
identi<U+FB01>cation is not possible, so proxy measures for those are also not
possible. However, information on car availability, the parent's mode
to work, and variables related to perceptions of local shops and facilities
were included, and thus related relevant measures are included.

The urban/rural classi<U+FB01>cation that is used in this study is the Scottish

6-fold urban/rural classi<U+FB01>cations that are: large urban (N 125,000 people),

other urban, accessible small town, remote small town, accessible rural,

and remote rural. In this classi<U+FB01>cation, “accessible” distinguishes rural

areas or towns that are within a 30-minute drive of a town or an urban

area respectively. It therefore differentiates between potential commuter

towns or rural areas and those that are more autonomous (here,

“remote”).

The deprivation index that is provided in the dataset is the Scottish

Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). It is the Scottish Government's

of<U+FB01>cial measure of area based multiple deprivations. The 2009 indices

encapsulate 37 different indicators in seven domains including income,

employment, health, education, skills and training, accessibility, and

crime. In combination or individually, these indices provide a relative

measure of deprivation for each data zone [29].


3. Analysis and results

3.1. Mode share and reasonable walking distance
To begin, the mode shares of children aged 10 and 11 years with re-

spect to gender are presented in Fig. 1. Very little difference can be seen
with respect to gender, with a larger percentage of girls taking school

buses and a smaller percentage travelling by cars than for boys.

If distance is considered as a de<U+FB01>ning measure, then clear differences
in mode use are evident. Taking the 80th percentile of the distance
walked by those children in the dataset (see [30] for further discussion

of this threshold concept), it was found that for Scotland the “reason-
able” walking distance for children aged 10 to 11 years was 0.78 km.
The 80th percentile represents an “elbow” in the distribution of dis-
tances, after which a few students travelled considerably longer dis-

tances (whom may be considered outliers or anomalies). Using this

criterion, 83.5% of children living within 0.78 km walked to school,
while only 26.7% of those living beyond that threshold did.


3.2. Analysis of the factors related to a child walking to school


Several steps were taken prior to the <U+FB01>nal models that are presented
below. The initial steps related to the variable attrition method are sum-

marized before the <U+FB01>nal models are given.


In the <U+FB01>rst step of the variable attrition method used, correlation
analyses (chi-square tests for independence for non-parametric and
bivariate correlation for parametric) were completed between the
dummy variable child walks to school and measures for: neighbourhood

perceptions (23 positively framed and 25 negatively); reasons for

choosing the current residence (11 questions); household characteris-
tics (e.g., family structure, income, education, car availability and use,
etc.); child's characteristics (e.g., sex, age) and built environment char-
acteristics (e.g., deprivation categories, built environment categories).3

Of those, 21 variables were found to be signi<U+FB01>cantly correlated at

a b 0.1. In the second step, those 21 variables were used in an initial ex-

panded binary logit model that did not include the threshold distance.

Variables that were signi<U+FB01>cant in that step (the 2nd) at a b 0.1 were

retained for the <U+FB01>nal analyses.

Two binary (or direct) logistic regression models were tested: one

with the signi<U+FB01>cant variables from the preliminary (expanded) binary

analysis; a second that also included the threshold distance dummy var-

iable (Table 2). The coef<U+FB01>cients indicate a propensity to walk to school

(dependent variables: 1 = walk to school; 0 = otherwise). Binary logis-

tic regression models were used as the research question relates to a bi-

nary variable (e.g., either the child walks to school or they do not). With

consideration to the number of potential variables, a reduction tech-

nique such as factor analysis could have been used. However, such a

method results in indices that cannot be easily interpreted. The variable
attrition technique used in this study allowed for many variables to be
considered without limiting the research to only that which the re-
searchers might have considered important. The results shown in
Table 2 are discussed in the next section.

4. Discussion


A number of important <U+FB01>ndings can be found in Table 2. First, from

the potential 70 plus different variables, only <U+FB01>ve variables (not includ-
ing distance) were retained in the <U+FB01>nal models following the attrition
process. Unlike most previous studies, this research did not pre-select

the variables to be included, thus any variable (within the limits of the
survey) that might in<U+FB02>uence walking could have been retained. Further,

this is possibly the <U+FB01>rst time where parents' general perceptions of their
neighbourhood and reasons for choosing a house have been used with

respect to explaining walking to school. Previous studies that have con-

sidered parents' attitudes or perceptions have mostly focussed on spe-
ci<U+FB01>c transportation considerations.
Before interpreting the results of the regression analysis, the
<U+FB01>nding for the threshold distance (a “reasonable” walking distance) is
discussed. For Scottish children aged 10 and 11 years this was deter-
mined to be 0.78 km based on the 80% threshold used in previous

studies [31,30]. This distance is comparable, if slightly shorter, to those
found by Morency et al. [30] who examined children in Montreal,
Canada and reported distances of roughly 0.88 km for 9–10 years old
and 1.09 km for 11–12 years old. Thus, for children in Scotland of this
age, 0.5 miles (e.g., [13]) might be an appropriate threshold, but it ap-
pears that for children in Montreal at least, it is too short and for both
0.5 km is below the threshold (e.g., [15]).
The inclusion of the distance threshold variable to the binary logistic
regression model reduced the number of signi<U+FB01>cant variables, while at
the same time considerably increasing (at least doubling) the variation
explained by the model. This con<U+FB01>rms that distance is probably the
strongest explanatory factor when it comes to walking to school,
which is in-line with McDonald and Aalborg's [13] <U+FB01>ndings, for exam-
ple. Their study showed that, in the United States, the number of chil-
dren walking to school nationally is only about 13%, but when it is
broken down by 0.5 mile increments, nearly 80% of children who live
within 0.5 miles walk or cycle [13]. For this sample, roughly 83% of stu-
dents within the 0.78 km (roughly 0.5 miles) threshold walked to
school, thus supporting McDonald and Aalborg's [13] <U+FB01>ndings. Lastly,
in this sample from Scotland about half of all children lived within the
“reasonable” walking distance, and national averages for walking to
school are around 50% [3]. This result points towards school location
policy and housing development policies as being key tools in improv-
ing walking to school.
However, while distance is a strong determinant for children walk-
ing to school, it does not explain everything. With respect to perceptions
of their neighbourhood, three measures were retained in the models
and two measures were found to be statistically signi<U+FB01>cant. Past re-
search that considered parents' perceptions of their neighbourhood
had mixed results [15,26,27,32,21]. Here, the measure good local shops
was positively correlated, while traf<U+FB01>c is slow or safe was negatively
correlated. The latter result is non-intuitive and both variables are
discussed next. The third perception variable contained in the model,
friendly people in the neighbourhood, was not signi<U+FB01>cant once the dis-
tance threshold was included. So, although intuitively and corroborated
by studies in sociology [33] we might expect that a neighbourhood with
friendly people would support children walking to school by reducing
parental anxiety, it was not found to be statistically in<U+FB02>uential here.
The perception of good local shops may indicate an area where there
is local walking, as people who would consider their local shops to be
good, would likely do some of their shopping locally. Unfortunately, it
is not evident how the individuals would interpret this question, as it
is subjective. We offer that the respondents would likely think of not
only whether the shops were useful to accomplish daily tasks such as
buying groceries, but also whether the upkeep of the shops was reason-
able (e.g., the shops are visually well-maintained). In Scotland and in
the United Kingdom in general, high streets with small-scale shops are
still a regular part of the urban environment. Interaction between
IATSS Research 38 (2015) 125–129
shoppers and shopkeepers is common, which was found to be an im-
portant factor in sense of place [34] and may result in the parent feeling

that there are familiar “eyes on the street” [35]. Such a feeling was men-
tioned as being a factor in letting children walk alone to places [33,36]. If
suf<U+FB01>cient people were walking in the neighbourhood, it would also sug-
gest a social norm of walking. Unfortunately, what constitutes ‘good’
shops is not clear, but should act as a proxy of the likelihood of the par-

ents using them.

Continuing with parental perceptions, the negative correlation of
traf<U+FB01>c is slow and safe is at <U+FB01>rst counter-intuitive as one would expect
that such a perception would be related to a decreased sense of traf<U+FB01>c
danger, but given second thought there is a possible explanation. Such

a perception may be associated with neighbourhoods that have low
congestion, thus making it easier for the parent to drive their child.


That would relate to the parent's convenience factor [15,20]. Further,

Babey et al. [26] did not <U+FB01>nd perceived traf<U+FB01>c danger to be a signi<U+FB01>cant
explanatory variable in children walking to school either. Thus, higher
levels of traf<U+FB01>c may actually act as a deterrent to the parent's conve-
nience to drive the child. To be clear though, we do not suggest that
the promotion of traf<U+FB01>c (as opposed to congestion) would be an appro-
priate means to improve walking rates.
Moving onto the impact of household cars. As mentioned previously,
household car ownership was not available, but the variable car avail-
ability was negatively associated to children walking to school. Over
80% of the households reported having access to a car and about 60%
of those households reported driving to work. However, only 30% of
the parents of elementary aged children reported that they drove their
children to school. When those results are considered with the distance
threshold, less than 12% of children within the “reasonable” walking
distance were driven to school compared to over 37% above that thresh-
old. Thus, as the analysis demonstrated, distance is a stronger explana-
tory variable than car availability.
Lastly, none of the built environment measures were retained in the
<U+FB01>nal regression models. This does not imply that the built environment
is not important, as measures such as distance, good local shops, and
traf<U+FB01>c speed were retained in the model and are linked to built environ-
ment. Distance relates to the population or dwelling density and where
the school is located with respect to the population. The probability of
local shops (as opposed to large shops that attract people from outside
the local area) existing relates to the number of people living locally
(again, population density). The traf<U+FB01>c speed would relate to regulation
(what speed is legally allowed), street design (e.g., narrow or wide, sin-
gle lane or multiple lane), and congestion (which would relate to traf<U+FB01>c
generation and street design). Further, the built environment measures
were non-precise, distinguishing only between urban, town, or rural
with the latter two distinguishing between those that are within com-
muting distance of an urban centre or not, and “urban” using a threshold
of 125,000 people.


4.1. Potential solutions

Distance was the strongest explanatory variable in this study. Short-
term solutions to distance are likely dif<U+FB01>cult. As demonstrated by the
difference between the distance threshold for Scottish and Canadian
children, the “reasonable” distance can vary. One means to potentially
increase that threshold would be to address parental concerns. Commu-
nity organized walking school buses led by children, as found in Japan
[7,36], could reduce parental concerns about stranger danger (not di-
rectly included in this study, but signi<U+FB01>cant for children in London
[14]) and traf<U+FB01>c. In one study [7], all children walked to school, regard-
less of distance and the walking school bus was given as the reason for
this success. In a walking school bus, the children walk as a group, thus
they are more visible to vehicles, thus reducing traf<U+FB01>c danger and as a
group they are not isolated (e.g., walking alone), which should also re-
duce parental anxiety about stranger danger.

E.O.D. Waygood, Y.O. Susilo /
Another short-term solution to overcome the problem of distance

without resorting to motorised modes, would be to improve cycling
conditions. Godefroy and Morency [31] demonstrated that for children
aged 5 to 12 years in Montreal, the threshold distance was 1.99 km for

boys and 1.27 km for girls. For boys, this is nearly double the threshold
distance for walking (1.09 km) for children aged 11 and 12 years old.
Improving children's cycling rates is another challenge, and a detailed

discussion of how that might be achieved is not possible here.
Longer-term solutions include addressing built environment aspects
such as land-use, density, school location, and smaller blocks allowing

for greater connectivity (e.g., [37]). Developers play the game within

the rules set by the policy decision makers. It is the responsibility of
planners (land-use, housing, and transportation) to work together to
create rules that result in more travel options for parents and environ-

ments that support children's active travel. Improvements here could
reduce distances, better support local shops, and reduce traf<U+FB01>c speed
through street design and regulation.


5. Conclusions


This paper looked at walking trips to school for children in Scotland
aged ten and eleven years. It identi<U+FB01>ed a cultural-speci<U+FB01>c “reasonable”
walking distance, and then used binary logit analysis to consider the

“reasonable” walking distance, nearly 50 parental perceptions of the
neighbourhood, 11 different possible reasons for choosing a home,
household demographics, and built environment variables. Unique as-

pects of this paper include: a general household survey that did not
focus on children's travel was used, thus avoiding the potential bias of
parents “justifying” why their children do not walk to school; the

breadth of parental perceptions of the neighbourhood; and reasons for

choosing a home.
In the binary logit analysis, few parental perceptions were signi<U+FB01>-

cant. However, the perception of good local shops was associated with

more walking, while traf<U+FB01>c is slow or safe was negatively correlated.
Reasons for such <U+FB01>ndings are discussed above. Car availability was the
largest negatively associated variable.

Living within the “reasonable” walking distance was by far the
greatest explanatory factor considered. Solutions that increase the
“reasonable” walking distance that children will walk such as walking

in groups and infrastructure that support cycling may help increase
overall active travel rates, but some attention must be paid to home lo-
cation choice and development of urban areas.
