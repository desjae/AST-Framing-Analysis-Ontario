were statistically signi<U+FB01>cant only in 1990. In contrast, males biked to school two to three times more than
females. These modal differences may result from females’ observed lower levels of independent mobil-
ity. Policy interventions, such as the Safe Routes to School program, can address gender differences by
providing programs such as the Walking School Bus that provide adult supervision on the school trip.
Bicycle interventions should ensure that females are participating in the programs.

Most studies <U+FB01>nd that males walk and bike to school more than
females. However, differences are often not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant.
McMillan et al. (2006) is one of the few studies to focus on gen-
der differences in school travel. The study found that third to <U+FB01>fth
grade Californian boys were signi<U+FB01>cantly more likely than girls to
walk and bike to school (27% vs. 19%). This study also found that
the amount of time the caregiver walks moderated the effect of
gender on active transportation to school. When caregivers spent
more time walking, there were fewer sex differences in children’s
behavior. Several other California studies have found signi<U+FB01>cant
gender differences. For example, Rosenberg et al. (2006) showed
that fourth and <U+FB01>fth grade boys from southern California were
more likely to walk, bike, or skateboard to school at least 2–3 days
per week than girls. In a study of California teenagers, Babey et al.
(2009) found that the odds of walking or biking to school for girls
were two-thirds that of boys.
International studies have also found signi<U+FB01>cant differences.
Timperio et al. (2006), in their study of 235 5–6 year olds and
677 10–12 year olds in Melbourne, Australia, found boys aged
10–12 biked at signi<U+FB01>cantly higher rates than girls (9.2% vs.
3.7%), but there were no differences in walk rates. The study found
no gender differences in walk and bike rates among younger chil-
dren. A larger Australian study (n = 2961) of 10 and 14 year olds
found signi<U+FB01>cant differences in school travel by sex. They found
girls were more likely to walk to school (44.3% vs. 37.4%), but were
less likely to bike (8.3% vs. 22.4%) leading to lower overall rates of
active travel among females (Leslie et al., 2010). In a London, On-
tario study of similarly aged children (11–13 years old), Larsen
et al. (2009) found that boys were 1.5 times more likely to walk
or bike for school travel. Nelson et al. (2008) found that high school
boys in Ireland were signi<U+FB01>cantly more likely to walk to school
than girls. Yelavich et al. (2008) found similarly results among ele-
mentary school children in New Zealand. In the UK, Panter et al.

(2010) report that boys are more likely to use non-motorized
modes than girls, but among non-motorized mode users, girls were

signi<U+FB01>cantly more likely than boys to walk (boys were more likely

to use bicycles).

There are several examples of studies that found no association

between gender and school travel. Martin et al. (2007) reported no

signi<U+FB01>cant difference in rates of active transportation to school

among a nationally representative sample of 2649 US children

aged 9–15 living within 1 mile of their school. A study of 315 Geor-

gia children aged 5–15 living within 1 mile of school found that

boys walked to school more frequently than girls (19.3–17.9) but

the difference was not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (Bricker et al.,

2002). Kerr et al. (2006) reported no gender differences in walking

and biking to school for children aged 5–18 living in Seattle. Booth
et al. (2007) examined mode choice to school among sixth graders
in New South Wales, Australia, and found no signi<U+FB01>cant difference
in the likelihood of walking (vs. riding in a car or using public
transport) by gender. Similarly, Page et al. (2010) and Black et al.
(2001) found no differences in mode choice to school by gender
for children in the UK and Grize et al. (2010) found no differences
in school mode choice for Swiss boys and girls.

2.1. Age

This review suggests that gender effects may be most important
for third through eighth grade (ages 8–13) students. In fact some of
the variation in results may come from the different age groups
studied. Existing research on children’s mobility shows that age
is a critical determinant of children’s travel and play (Matthews,
1992). In a study of a New England town, Hart (1979) found that
children, particularly boys, gained much more travel independence
around age 10. A study in the UK found the same increase in inde-
pendence occurred around 8 or 9 (Matthews, 1992). This suggests
Transport Geography 20 (2012) 80–86                                      81


that studies which do not disaggregate by age may not detect sex
differences. In other words, children under 8 may not exhibit sex
differences because most are not allowed to travel independently.
Data from the UK also suggest that sex differences disappear for
high school age children (Hillman et al., 1990).
The documented differences in boys’ and girls’ travel freedom
may relate to gendered parenting practices. In-depth qualitative
studies of children’s mobility have found that parental concern
for the safety of females combined with higher levels of household
responsibility may cause girls to have smaller home ranges and
make fewer trips without adults (Hart, 1979; O’Brien et al., 2000;
Valentine, 1997). However Valentine (1997) found that middle
class parents were reluctant to assign older children responsibility
for younger siblings and have strong safety concerns for boys as
well as girls.

2.2. Location in region

O’Brien et al. (2000) found that children’s freedom of movement
was higher for both boys and girls in a lower-density New Town as
compared to London. They concluded that the ‘‘sheer vastness and
social heterogeneity of global cities, such as London, may make
them unknowable to children and adults alike’’. Earlier research
had shown the opposite with sex differences being minimized in
an urban setting and maximized in suburban and rural environ-
ments (Hart, 1979; van Vliet, 1983) Given the vastly different set-
tings these studies used (and differing de<U+FB01>nitions of low density),
this research may suggest that the effect of density is non-linear
and that children have the greatest freedom in places that are
small enough for parents to know their neighbors but large enough
for children to have walkable destinations.


2.3. Sample size


The inconsistent relationship between school travel mode and

gender is also a product of varying research designs. The ability

to detect statistically signi<U+FB01>cant differences, i.e. power, depends

on the size of the differences and sample size. With a small sample,

differences must be very large to be judged statistically signi<U+FB01>cant.

With a very large sample, even quite small differences can often be

statistically signi<U+FB01>cant. Of the studies that report a signi<U+FB01>cant gen-

der effect, the difference in walk rates between males and females

ranges from 4% to 8% points. Detecting a difference of this size

requires a sample of at least 1000–3000 to have adequate power,

e.g. 0.8. Many of the studies discussed above had smaller sample

sizes.


3. Data

The NPTS is a population-based survey conducted by the US
Department of Transportation (DOT) in 1969, 1977, 1983, 1990,
1995, 2001, and 2009. The survey collects information on all trips
undertaken by members of selected households on a randomly-as-
signed survey day. Household members are asked to provide infor-
mation on all trips including purpose, mode, and travel time. Data
are collected on the demographic characteristics, e.g. age and sex,
of all household members. Race and ethnicity are collected for
the adult respondent, generally a parent or guardian. Individual
data are available for the 1977–2009 surveys.
The unit of analysis is the unlinked trip to and from school. Trips
to school had a trip purpose of Civic/Educational/Religious (1977),
School/Church (1983, 1990), School (1995), Go to school as student
(2001, 2009); occurred on weekdays between 5am and 11am from
September to May; the respondent was between the ages of 5 and
18; and the respondent began the travel day at home. Trips from

82                                             N.C. McDonald / Journal of


school had a similar de<U+FB01>nition with the exception that the trip had
to begin between 1 pm and 6 pm. In the limited number of cases
where a respondent had more than one trip qualifying as a to or
from school trip, the earlier trip was counted as the school trip.
To be included in the analysis, respondents had to report travel
mode and sex. Based on this de<U+FB01>nition, 3297 surveyed individuals
made trips to school in 1977, 1295 in 1983, 4048 in 1990, 8398 in
1995, 12,426 in 2001, and 19,363 in 2009. Sample sizes for trips
home from school were slightly lower in each year with 3120 ob-
served trips home in 1977, 1199 in 1983, 4105 in 1990, 7812 in
1995, 11,681 in 2001 and 18,100 in 2009. These varying sample
sizes mean that for similar effect sizes power is lowest in 1983.
Although the NPTS is the only source of trend data on school
travel in the United States, there are several important limitations.
All of the information for youth under fourteen and much of the
data for <U+FB01>fteen and 16 year olds is proxy-reported by adults in
the household (US Department of Transportation, 2004a). How-
ever, it is likely that parents are accurate reporters for school trips.
Next, there have been important changes in the administration and
design of the NPTS. First, the 1977 and 1983 surveys utilized in-
person interviews conducted by <U+FB01>eld staff of the Census Bureau;
subsequent surveys relied on telephone interviews conducted by
private research <U+FB01>rms (Research Triangle Institute and Federal
Highway Administration, 1997; US Department of Transportation,
2004a). Second, prompts were added in the 2001 survey to encour-
age reporting of non-motorized trips (US Department of Transpor-
tation, 2004a). Third, the 1977 and 1983 surveys were based on a
clustered sample design; more recent surveys used a non-clustered
list-assisted Random Digit Dial sample strati<U+FB01>ed by geographic
area (US Department of Transportation, 2004a). Finally, response
rates were signi<U+FB01>cantly lower for the 1995, 2001, and 2009 surveys
due to the introduction of a travel diary system which required a
two-stage data collection process (US Department of Transporta-
tion, 2004a). While it is dif<U+FB01>cult to quantify the effects of these
changes, analyses by DOT have shown that reporting of school
and work trips has been relatively unchanged (US Department of
Transportation, 2004b). Because of that, methodological changes
should not alter the <U+FB01>ndings of this analysis which focuses on com-
paring mode split for a primary trip purpose across years.
Another important consideration with the NHTS is the role of
place. The literature documents variation in school travel behavior
in urban and suburban areas and even suggests the potential for
varying sex effects in different contexts. Analyses looking only at
national averages might miss this important local variation. The
large sample size in the 2009 data allows analysis of regional
and even neighborhood patterns in certain jurisdictions where
additional samples were collected, thereby allowing study of
whether the national patterns are repeated at the local level.


4. Results


The following sections present the <U+FB01>ndings from the NHTS ser-

ies. The <U+FB01>rst section presents national and regional estimates of

school trip mode shares by sex in aggregate and strati<U+FB01>ed by age.

The second section focuses on differences in independent mobility

between boys and girls. The third section develops multinomial

logit models of the trip to school to test whether behavior varies

signi<U+FB01>cantly by sex even when accounting for individual and

household factors. These <U+FB01>ndings are then related to current policy

interventions for school travel.


4.1. School travel

Table 1 shows the modal distribution for trips to and from

school by sex from 1977 to 2009. The data highlight some impor-

tant differences between males and females. Biking rates were two
to three times higher for males than females in nearly every year
(Table 1). However, biking accounted for a small proportion,
approximately one to two percent, of all school travel. The preva-
lence of walking to or from school did not vary signi<U+FB01>cantly be-
tween girls and boys in most years (Table 1). Differences were
generally one to two percentage points with boys often having
the higher prevalence of walking. One exception was 1990 where
signi<U+FB01>cant differences of approximately four percentage points
were observed in the prevalence of walking between males and fe-
males. Given the anomalous nature of this <U+FB01>nding, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to
interpret. The data con<U+FB01>rmed the <U+FB01>ndings from other studies that
automobility has increased and walking is more common on the
trip from school vs. the trip to school (Buliung et al., 2009; Hayghe,
1996; McDonald et al., 2011; Schlossberg et al., 2006). But patterns
of difference between males and females were similar in the morn-
ing and the afternoon even though walking and biking were more
common in the afternoon.

4.1.1. Robustness check: regional analyses
The national results could mask important gender differences at
the local level by ‘‘averaging out’’ gender effects. For example, con-
sider two identical cities. In City A, all girls are driven to school and
all boys walk to school; in City B, the reverse is true. An overall
analysis would <U+FB01>nd no gender differences even though substantial
differences exist at the city level. Oversampling of some regions in
the 2009 NHTS allowed detailed analyses of sub-regional differ-
ences in walk mode share by sex. In <U+FB01>ve metropolitan areas with
large samples of students, there were no statistically signi<U+FB01>cant
differences in the proportion of students walking to school by gen-
der in 2009 (Table 2). This was true overall and when disaggregat-
ed by residential density. For example, in the New York PMSA
(which includes New York City and Westchester, Rockland, and
Putnam counties) 12.9% of boys and 11.1% of girls walked to school
(p = 0.490). A county by county analysis of the PMSA also shows no
signi<U+FB01>cant gender differences. For example in the Bronx, 33.3% of
females walked to school and 34.6% of males walked (p = 0.925).
In Staten Island, 12.5% of females walked and 10.0% of males
walked (p = 0.687). In the highest density areas of the NY PMSA
(de<U+FB01>ned as block groups with densities above 10,000 people per
square mile), 21.9% of boys and 18.4% of girls walked (p = 0.468).
These results suggest it is unlikely that there is substantial averag-
ing out of gender differences.

4.2. Independent mobility

Theory suggests females have less travel freedom than males.
Studies have shown boys traveling further from home and being
more likely to travel without an adult (Matthews, 1992). These dif-
ferences might appear not only in how the student traveled to

school, but also in whom they traveled with. The 1990 through
2001 travel surveys showed that males were somewhat more

likely to be traveling by themselves or with friends and siblings

as they walked to schools; females were more likely to walk with

a household adult (Table 3).1 Many of the differences are not statis-

tically signi<U+FB01>cant but the pattern is consistent particularly for ele-

mentary school students.

The 2009 survey asked parents whose children lived within 2

miles of their school when they would allow their child to walk

or bike to school without an adult. Approximately 6% of parents

planned to give their <U+FB01>rst-graders permission to walk indepen-
dently (Fig. 1). By 12th grade, nearly 90% of parents planned to give

The 2009 data was omitted from this analysis because the results from the travel
diary escort data were inconsistent with the special section on school travel.

The in-depth qualitative studies undertaken by geographers of-
fer a basis for explaining these observations. Research done in the
1970s in the US and UK found that parents were quite concerned
about sexual molestation of girls and therefore limited their time
in the public realm (Matthews, 1992). At the same time, boys were
given substantial independence around age 10 in accordance with
the idea that ‘‘boys will be boys’’ and are less vulnerable to stranger
danger than girls (Hart, 1979). While less discussed in the litera-
ture, this could also explain why a signi<U+FB01>cant proportion of parents
expect to restrict travel freedom for high school girls. There is no
evidence that parents’ intention to limit the travel freedom of high
school girls comes to fruition as there are few gender differences in
the travel pattern of high school male and females.

4.3. Multivariate analysis

The simple proportions revealed strong sex differences in biking
to school and modest to non-existent differences in other modes.
However, the descriptive analyses highlighted the strong in<U+FB02>uence

of demographic factors such as age on mode choice. Multinomial

logit models were developed to better control for this and other
demographic factors. The models focused on trips of less than

2 miles – a common cut point where many school districts provide
school bus service – for students aged 5–14 (McDonald and How-
lett, 2007). The travel decisions of older students are complicated

by the transition to driving and therefore best explored separately.

Rural areas were also excluded from the analysis because of the
different conditions in those areas. By simultaneously controlling
for multiple individual and household factors, the logit models pro-

vided the most ef<U+FB01>cient test of whether there are gender differ-

ences in school travel.
For 1977–1995, multinomial logit models analyzed three modal
options: being driven to school, walking, or taking transit/school
buses. Biking was excluded from these models because the sam-
ples were too small to allow a robust set of covariates. For 2001
and 2009, biking was included as a fourth travel option. The mod-
els controlled for distance to school, age, race, vehicle ownership,
single parent status, and location in region. From 1977 to 1990, trip
distance was available as a two categories variable (<1 mile, 1–1.99
miles); from 1995 to 2009, distance information was continuous
though users tended to report in common increments (e.g. 1/
2 mile, 1 mile). Data from these later years was recoded as a cate-
gorical variable (<0.5 miles, 0.5 miles, 0.51–0.99 miles, 1 mile,
1.01–1.99 miles). Density of a household’s block group was avail-
able for 1990–2009. For 1977 and 1983, only information on

whether the residence was in the census-designated center city
area was available.
The modeling had two goals. The <U+FB01>rst was to test whether males
and females responded differently to the factors that affect walk-
ing. In other words, were the coef<U+FB01>cient vectors equal for males
and females? This required a Chow-type test. However because lo-
git models are conditioned on the variance of unobserved factors, a
standard Chow test would fail to account for these scale differences
(Swait and Louviere, 1993). The Louviere–Swait test is a modi<U+FB01>ed
Chow test accounting for potential differences in variance between
males and females by adding a scale parameter based on sex. To
make the problem identi<U+FB01>able, only the ratio of the male to female
scale parameters was estimated, i.e. the scale parameter for males
is arbitrarily set to 1. The likelihood ratio was then used to test
whether the coef<U+FB01>cient vectors are equal (allowing the alternative
speci<U+FB01>c constants to vary), i.e. bF = bM. This was done by comparing
the log likelihood of the joint model to the sum of the log likeli-
hood of the female only and male only models.

The second goal was to test whether females were less likely to
walk or bike to school than males even if they had similar
responses to explanatory factors such as age and trip distance. So
even if there were no signi<U+FB01>cant differences in the coef<U+FB01>cients on
explanatory variables between males and females, did the alterna-
tive speci<U+FB01>c constant differ between males and females? This is
simply a test of whether the coef<U+FB01>cient on the female dummy var-
iable is signi<U+FB01>cantly different from zero and is appropriate when
the Louviere–Swait test shows no differences in coef<U+FB01>cient vectors.
Borrowing the previous notation, this was a test that b1 = 0 with bF
constrained to equal bM.
The Louviere–Swait test showed no evidence that the coef<U+FB01>-
cients on explanatory variables differed between males and fe-
males, i.e. there was no reason to reject the null hypothesis of
equality between bF and bM (Table 4). This means that variables
like trip distance and density do not have differential effects on
the utility of each travel mode for males vs. females. In addition,
there was no evidence that the variance of unobserved factors,
i.e. the scale factor k, varied between males and females. Therefore
<U+FB01>nal models did not include a scale factor. Full model results are
available from the author upon request.
While there was no evidence of differing responses to the vari-
ables of interest, models estimated jointly for males and females
suggested that females were less likely to walk or bike to school
for short trips. Speci<U+FB01>cally the coef<U+FB01>cient on the female dummy
variable in the walk and bike utilities was always negative with
one exception (walk utility in 2001). For biking, the multivariate
models reinforced the descriptive <U+FB01>ndings. Females are signi<U+FB01>-
without     cantly less likely to bike to school than males. The story is more
complex for walking. Females are generally less likely to walk to

school for short trips, but the effect was only signi<U+FB01>cant in 1990
and 1995. In 2009, the coef<U+FB01>cient was at the edge of statistical sig-
ni<U+FB01>cance (p = 0.08).
To better understand sex differences, it is helpful to translate
the model coef<U+FB01>cients into estimates of how sex affects the proba-
bility of walking or biking to school. This discrete effect was
estimated as the average over the sample of each individual’s pre-
dicted probability of walking if the respondent were female less
the predicted probability if the individual were male (Train,
2003). The results showed that the effects of sex on walking to
school have decreased over time, but being female was always
associated with a decrease in walking (Table 4). In 1977, being fe-
male was associated with a 4.9% point decrease in the probability
of walking all else being equal. In 2009, being female was associ-
ated with a 1.5 percentage point decrease.


5. Implications for planners and researchers


The models and simple averages provide evidence that females
are somewhat less likely to walk to school than males, with the dif-
ferences narrowing in recent decades. However, the lack of strong
differences in walking to school does not imply that females have
begun walking as much as males, but rather that both groups have
become equally unlikely to walk.
In contrast to walking, strong sex differences exist in biking to
school in the US. This is a particular concern because studies of
adult biking suggest women in the US are less likely to bike than
men (Garrard et al., 2008). While no studies have looked at the life-
cycle effects of bicycling, it is certainly intriguing that gender dif-
ferences in cycling emerge at such a young age in the US. This
stands in contrast to countries where biking is more common. A
study of 9-year olds in Denmark found equal rates of biking
(38%) to school among boys and girls (Cooper et al., 2006) and in
Jiangsu Province, China approximately two-thirds of 12–14 year
old boys and girls cycled to school (Shi et al., 2006).
For advocates and policymakers interested in increasing walk-
ing and biking to school, these <U+FB01>ndings suggest the need for atten-
tion to gendered travel behavior. But the <U+FB01>ndings do not fully
explain the mechanisms causing differences between males and fe-
males. The data suggest that parental limits on mobility may be
stronger for females than males as evidenced by differences in
when children were allowed to travel without an adult. This argues

for creating interventions that affect parental behavior. However,
this approach privileges parental perspectives without recognizing
children’s agency (Thomsen, 2004). Could gender differences

emerge from different travel preferences between boys and girls?

Or do gender differences emerge from complex interactions be-
tween parents and children? Even if parents place equal restric-
tions on males and females and both sexes have similar

preferences for walking and biking, differences could emerge if
males are more likely to negotiate with parents about the rules

governing travel. Further research is needed to sort out these
mechanisms and provide a more rigorous explanation for observed
differences.
Nevertheless, existing programs can address some of the causes
of gender differences. If parental concerns limit walking and biking
for females, then organized parental escorts might overcome those
fears. These efforts could mimic the existing ‘‘walking school bus’’
programs where a designated parental escort walks a group of chil-
dren to school at a set time and route (Collins and Kearns, 2005). If
youth travel preferences are key factors in gender differences, then
school or community-based encouragement programs might
change behavior. For example, the Boltage program offers individ-
ualized encouragement to bike to school. Schools adopting this
program could focus on ensuring that substantial numbers of fe-
males enroll in the program.


6. Conclusion


This study found that males were somewhat more likely to walk
to and from school than females but the differences were generally
not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant. In contrast, males were two to three
times more likely to bike to and from school than females. The ob-
served differences in walking and biking to and from school may
result from females’ being less likely to have permission to walk
or bike without an adult than males of the same age. These differ-
ences in permission to travel independently emerge around 5th
grade and continue through high school. These results suggest that
policymakers and advocates for increasing active transportation to
school should pay attention to gendered travel behavior by devel-
oping interventions that address parental concerns about students
traveling alone and encourage females to take part in active trans-
port programs. Further research is needed to understand how gen-
der differences in school travel emerge.
