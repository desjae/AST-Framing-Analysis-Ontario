Problem, research strategy, and
findings: Increasing walking and bicycling
to school has been a national policy goal
since Congress created the Safe Routes to
School (SRTS) program. While previous

research has suggested positive program
impacts, there have been no large-scale
studies with strong research designs. Here we
study 801 schools in the District of
Columbia, Florida, Oregon, and Texas to

assess how the proportion of students
walking and bicycling to school changed

after the introduction of SRTS programs. By
including schools with and without SRTS
programs and analyzing data collected over
time (2007–2012), we are able to distinguish
SRTS impacts from secular trends. We find

increases in walking and bicycling after
schools implemented SRTS programs.
Engineering improvements are associated
with an 18% relative increase in walking and
bicycling, and the effects of education and
encouragement programs are cumulative.
Over the course of five years, these education

and encouragement programs could lead to a
25% relative increase in walking and
bicycling.
Takeaway for practice: Planners should
work to prioritize capital improvements that
improve non-motorized access to school and
revise comprehensive plans and subdivision
regulations to ensure that new development
supports access to school.

ncreasing active transportation to school has been a national policy goal
since Congress included the Safe Routes to School (SRTS) program in the
2005 federal transportation bill. Policy attention to this topic reflects the


health benefits associated with regular physical activity, environmental benefits
from decreased driving, and safety benefits from decreasing injuries and fatali-
ties related to school travel (Davison, Werder, & Lawson, 2008; DiMaggio &
Li, 2013; Janssen & LeBlanc, 2010; Woodcock et al., 2009; Younger, Morrow-
Almeida, Vindigni, & Dannenberg, 2008). The role that planners have in

infrastructure investment and the skills planners have in coordinating initia-


tives with developers, schools, and local law enforcement place them at the
center of efforts to encourage walking and bicycling to school.
Between 2005 and 2012, Congress appropriated $1.2 billion for the SRTS
program to provide education, encouragement, and enforcement programs as
well as engineering improvements at almost 14,000 elementary and middle

schools (McDonald, Barth, & Steiner, 2013; National Center for Safe Routes

to School, 2013a). Existing evaluations of the SRTS program find increases in
walking and bicycling to school (Boarnet, Day, Anderson, McMillan, &
Alfonzo, 2005; Mendoza et al., 2011; Stewart, Moudon, & Claybrooke, 2014)
and decreases in injuries near SRTS improvements (DiMaggio & Li, 2013;
Ragland, Pande, Bigham, & Cooper, 2014). However, many of the studies

focus on small geographic areas, such as an individual school or school district,

limiting the generalizability of findings (Buckley, Lowry, Brown, & Barton,
2013; McDonald, Yang, Abbott, & Bullock, 2013; Mendoza et al., 2011).

to discern SRTS impacts from secular trends (Staunton,
Hubsmith, & Kallins, 2003).
This study addresses both of these concerns by evalu-
ating the SRTS program in the District of Columbia
(DC) and three states—Florida, Oregon, and Texas—
using a strong research design with case and control
schools, which allows identification of the independent
impacts of the SRTS program. Using data from 801
schools, we find a positive impact of the SRTS program
on walking and bicycling. Engineering improvements are
associated with an 18% relative increase in walking and
bicycling. The effects of education and encouragement
programs are cumulative, with each additional year of
program participation associated with an absolute in-
crease of 1% in the proportion of students walking and
bicycling to school. Over the course of five years, these
education and encouragement programs could lead to a
25% relative increase in walking and bicycling. These
results provide planners with the evidence required to
make provision of safe walk and bicycle routes to school a
standard part of planning practice using tools such as the
comprehensive plan, subdivision regulations, and capital
budgeting and planning.


Background

SRTS Program Overview
The 2005 federal transportation bill, the Safe,
Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity
Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), authorized
SRTS as a new program that would provide full federal
funding to enable and encourage children, including
those with disabilities, to walk and bicycle to school; to
make walking and bicycling to school safe and more
appealing; and to facilitate the planning, development,
and implementation of projects that improve safety and
reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the
vicinity of schools (Federal Highway Administration,
2007).
The SRTS program provided grants to assist commu-
nities across the country in creating safer and more sup-
portive environments for children to walk or bicycle to
school. The program contributed to multiple policy objec-
tives, including the U.S. Department of Transportation’s
livability goals and the Department of Health and Human
Services’ efforts to increase physical activity and reduce
obesity in children and adolescents. These efforts sought to
reverse sharp declines in walking and bicycling to school
from about 48% in 1969 to less than 13% in 2009
(McDonald, Brown, Marchetti, & Pedroso, 2011).

Vol. 80, No. 2



The program allocated funding to state departments of
transportation (DOTs) based on the number of school-
aged children. Each state was required to set aside 10% to
30% of the funds for non-infrastructure-related activities
such as public awareness campaigns and outreach to the
community, traffic education, bicycle and pedestrian safety
programs for children, and training for SRTS volunteers
and managers. The infrastructure investments could in-
clude the planning, design, and construction of sidewalk
improvements; traffic calming and speed reduction im-
provements; pedestrian and bicycle crossing improvements;
on-street bicycle facilities; off-street bicycle and pedestrian
facilities; secure bicycle parking; and traffic diversion
improvements in the vicinity of schools (within 2 miles)
that would substantially improve the ability of students to
walk and bicycle to school. Each state was also required to
fund a full-time coordinator for the state’s SRTS program.
In 2012, the SRTS program was merged with other non-
motorized funding programs into the Transportation
Alternatives Program (Federal Highway Administration,
2013a).

SRTS Evaluation Studies
Many studies evaluate aspects of the SRTS program.
Several of those studies are primarily descriptive, aimed at
explaining the program history, trends, or funding
mechanism and expenditures (Cradock, Fields, Barrett, &
Melly, 2012; McDonald, Barth, et al., 2013; National
Center for Safe Routes to School, 2013b). The remainder
focuses on the impacts of SRTS programs on active
transportation and injuries. Most attention has been
given to the program’s impacts on the modes of travel
children use to go to and from school; the results
generally show increased walking and bicycling. The
study designs of these evaluations have been a major
challenge. Studies with strong research designs tend to
have a limited geographic scope and range of SRTS
interventions, and therefore limited generalizability.
For example, Mendoza et al. (2011) test the impacts of
researcher-led walking school bus programs using a
randomized controlled trial in eight low-income Houston
schools, finding these programs led to more walking to
school. However, it is unclear what the impact of the
intervention would be in other areas or with “walking
school buses” organized by volunteers or school staff.
Another set of recent studies investigates a wider
range of environments using comparisons of active travel
before and after SRTS interventions or between areas
with and without SRTS interventions. For example,
Stewart et al. (2014) use data from 53 schools in four
states and find walking and bicycling increased from

Data: Contextual School, Neighborhood, and
Survey Information
Previous research has shown that walking and bicycling
to school varies based on demographic and spatial charac-
teristics (Davison, Werder, & Lawson, 2008; McDonald,
Brown, et al., 2011). To control for this systematic varia-
tion, we incorporated information about school character-
istics from the National Center for Education Statistics
(NCES) and information about neighborhood characteris-
tics from the American Community Survey (ACS). The
NCES database contains annual information on enroll-
ment, racial and ethnic composition, free and reduced-
price lunch program eligibility, and school location for
American public schools.1 We obtained neighborhood
socio-demographic information from the 2007–2011 ACS
using the block group where the school was located.2 Most
neighborhood-level sociodemographic variables (e.g., racial
and ethnic composition of residents) were not significant
in preliminary models and are not included in the final
models due to the lack of significance and the presence of
school-level measures of racial and ethnic composition. We
retain median household income in the final model despite
a lack of statistical significance because previous research
has highlighted meaningful economic differences in walk-
ing and bicycling to school and we wanted to control for

neighborhood-level income variation in addition to school-
level variation (McDonald, 2008).
The school’s location is also used to assess the local
built environment through street network and destination
proximity metrics. Final models include Walk Score as a
primary environmental metric, a commercially available
index (0–100) that correlates with access to walkable desti-
nations and residential population density (Carr, Dunsiger,
& Marcus, 2011; Duncan, Aldstadt, Whalen, Melly, &
Gortmaker, 2011).3 We tested metrics of street connectivity,
such as intersection density and average block length, in the
models, but they were not statistically significant.

Sample Summary
Schools with SRTS programs differ on some but not
all characteristics. For example, as Table 5 shows, schools
with SRTS programs had a lower percentage of Hispanic
students and a higher proportion of African-American
students than schools without a SRTS program. Schools
with SRTS programs had a smaller number of enrolled
students. Economic characteristics were similar across the
two groups; there are no significant differences in the
proportion of students receiving free or reduced-price
lunch or the block group median household income.
Schools receiving SRTS interventions were located in

neighborhoods with a higher population density and better
access to destinations as measured by Walk Score.
Active travel was more common at schools that
received an SRTS intervention during the study period
than at control schools. Rates of walking and bicycling to
school averaged 18% to school and 22% from school, but
with considerable variation across schools. For example, the
bottom quarter of schools had active travel rates of less
than 8%, while the top quarter of schools had rates higher
than 26% in the morning. These reports are higher than
recent national estimates of walking and bicycling (13%)
(McDonald, Brown, et al., 2011).

Analysis
By using schools with and without SRTS programs in
a wide range of contexts, we are able to identify the
impacts of SRTS programs and ensure these impacts are
not confounded with secular trends or demographics. We
model the proportion of students that walked or bicycled
to school as a function of two factors: SRTS interventions
and contextual variables related to school, neighborhood,
and survey characteristics. The focus of our interest is the
SRTS interventions in place at the school at the time of
the survey. For each observation of school travel mode,
we use our database of SRTS interventions to determine if
the SRTS program was in place at the school and, if so,
the number of years the program had been in place. This
structure allows researchers to test how the presence and
length of participation in the SRTS program affected
walking and bicycling.
We developed two models to test the impacts of the
SRTS program. The first focuses on the presence or
absence of any SRTS program elements without regard to
the exact nature of the efforts. This model provides the
broadest test of whether the SRTS program has affected
children’s travel behavior. The second model assesses the
impacts of different categories of SRTS interventions, such
as education and encouragement, engineering, and
enforcement, and is included to provide practitioners with
a better understanding of the impacts of each type of
SRTS intervention. We did not develop models to analyze
the impacts of specific SRTS projects, such as crosswalk
improvements, because we believe the choice of specific
intervention is controlled by idiosyncratic local conditions
that are difficult to model.
Models include contextual variables related to school,
neighborhood, and survey characteristics to control for
systematic variation in rates of walking and bicycling to
school unrelated to the SRTS interventions. For example,
the prevalence of walking and bicycling is higher in denser
areas. We systematically controlled for the time of day

because previous research shows that walking is higher in
the afternoon. We also controlled for who reported the
travel mode because we know that parents tend to report
higher walking and bicycling rates than do students
themselves (McDonald, Brown, et al., 2011).
We use a fractional logit model, as described in the
Technical Appendix, because it best fits our needs and the
data. To account for dependence across observations from
the same school, we use robust standard errors that adjust
for potential correlation across schools in the final models.
We also conducted several tests (described in the Technical
Appendix) to ensure that potential correlation across
observations from the same school and survey date did not
unduly influence the final results. All these additional tests
confirm the model results presented in this study.
We calculate the impacts of the SRTS program on
school travel mode by estimating the marginal effect of the
presence and number of years of SRTS interventions on
walking and bicycling. The reported marginal effects
represent how the proportion of students walking and
bicycling to school would change if the SRTS program
were implemented or if it were in place for one additional
year. Further details on the calculation of marginal effects
are available in the Technical Appendix.


SRTS and Children’s Travel to School

As Figure 1 shows, rates of walking and bicycling to
school increased with each year of participation in the
SRTS program. At schools with SRTS programs, 18% of
students walked or bicycled prior to the start of the pro-
gram. Schools with one year of SRTS program participa-
tion had average rates of walking and bicycling of 20%.
Schools with four or more years of SRTS participation had
active travel rates greater than 30%. These simple averages
showed an absolute increase of 13 percentage points, or a
relative change of 71%, in the proportion of students
walking and bicycling after five years of participating in the
SRTS program. These results suggest that SRTS programs
may strongly affect walking and bicycling. Moreover, there
may be a “dose-response” relationship where each addi-
tional year (or “dose”) of SRTS participation leads to more
walking and bicycling.
However, the simple averages are not a definitive
evaluation of the SRTS program because of the possibility
of selection bias. Schools with long-lived and successful
SRTS program may simply be located in environments
where walking is more likely or may have been surveyed in
a year when exogenous factors increased walking, such as
increases in gas prices. To address these issues, as described

above, we use multivariate regression models that introduce
statistical controls for school and neighborhood character-
istics, as well as time period, to assess active travel at
schools with and without SRTS programs.
After controlling for these other factors, we continue
to find that the SRTS program increased walking and
bicycling to school. Specifically, walking and bicycling rose
by 1.1 percentage points (p = .002) with each year of
participation in the SRTS program. These findings suggest
a linear “dose-response” relationship: Each additional year
of SRTS participation led, on average, to more walking and
bicycling. For example, if active travel rates were 18% prior
to the start of an SRTS program, our model predicts that
23.5% of students, on average, would walk and bicycle
after five years of program participation. This represents an
absolute increase of 5.5 percentage points and a relative
increase of 31% after five years of SRTS participation.
After one year of SRTS participation, the expected absolute
increase would be 1.1 percentage points or a relative
change of 6%. For reference, the Technical Appendix
contains the full model results.
In our second model, we compare the differential
impacts of engineering, education and encouragement, and
enforcement programs (the full model is available in the
Technical Appendix). The presence of an engineering
improvement was associated with a 3.3 percentage point
increase in walking and bicycling (p = .031); this impact
did not depend on how long the improvement had been in
place. For comparison, this would mean that schools with
18% of students walking and bicycling might expect to see

rates rise to 21.3%, on average, after completing an engi-
neering project. This represents a relative increase of 18%.
Education and encouragement interventions also had
significant positive impacts on walking and bicycling, with
each year of participation in an education and encourage-
ment program associated with a 0.9 percentage point
increase in walking and bicycling (p = .025). In other
words, schools that started with 18% of students walking
and bicycling would be expected to increase the rate of
active transportation by 0.9 percentage point per year to
22.5% after five years on average, an absolute change of
4.5 percentage points and a relative change of 25%.
Enforcement initiatives did not have a significant associa-
tion with walking and bicycling, though in our sample
many schools implemented education, encouragement,
and enforcement at the same time.
Other variables beyond simply adopting an SRTS
program also influence rates of walking and bicycling to
school in ways consistent with previous research. For
example, walking and bicycling were higher in areas with
greater population density. Walk Score, a proxy for access to
commercial and recreation amenities, had no significant
association, perhaps because the indicator only reflects access
and not the quality of the walking environment (Talen &
Koschinsky, 2013). Other factors also matter. Rates of
walking and bicycling were 3 percentage points higher in the
afternoon, results consistent with other studies (National

reported the students’ usual travel mode as opposed to their
actual travel mode (McDonald, Dwelley, et al., 2011).
School characteristics generally did not significantly
affect walking and bicycling to or from school. However, a
10 percentage point increase in the proportion of students
receiving free or reduced-price lunch was associated with a
0.5 percentage point increase in walking and bicycling. We
did include a dummy variable indicating whether the
school ever received a SRTS treatment to account for any
remaining differences between schools that participated in
the SRTS program and those that did not. The dummy
variable was not significant in either model, suggesting that
observed characteristics do an adequate job of adjusting for
differences between treatment and control schools.


Impacts of the SRTS Program

Our analysis shows that SRTS interventions are associ-
ated with increased walking and bicycling in DC, Florida,
Oregon, and Texas. We find that engineering improve-
ments are associated with an absolute increase of 3 percent-
age points in active travel, which represents a relative
increase of 18%. Education and encouragement programs
exhibit a dose-response relationship with walking and
bicycling, where each additional year of program participa-
tion is associated with a 1 percentage point increase in
walking and bicycling. Over a five-year period, these edu-
cation and encouragement programs would be expected to
lead to a relative increase in active travel of 25%. These
results hold when comparing funded schools only with
those that applied for the SRTS program and after control-
ling for other factors that influence walking to school such
as population density. These findings accord with the
results of previous studies, which also find positive impacts
of the SRTS program (Boarnet, Anderson, Day, McMillan,
& Alfonzo, 2005; McDonald, Yang, et al., 2013; Mendoza
et al., 2011; Staunton et al., 2003; Stewart et al., 2014).
However, our study represents a substantial extension of
the literature because it uses a stronger research design with
a large study area, thereby increasing confidence in the
generalizability of the results.
While this analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of
the SRTS program in meeting the goal of increasing
walking and bicycling to school, recent changes in federal
transportation policy may result in less federal funds being
available for such investments. The SRTS program was
created in the 2005 federal transportation bill, and
approximately $1.2 billion was appropriated for the pro-
gram (McDonald, Barth, et al., 2013). However, the 2012
transportation bill, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st

Century (MAP-21), dismantled the standalone SRTS
program and instead made SRTS projects eligible to com-
pete for funding with other non-motorized improvements.
In addition, MAP-21 decreased the total funding available
for non-motorized programs and allowed states increased
flexibility to move non-motorized funds to other programs.
It is not yet clear how these changes will affect state fund-
ing for the SRTS program, but it is possible that some
states will decrease funding for SRTS or non-motorized
programs more generally.
What do these results mean for planning practitioners?
This study provides strong evidence that children will walk
and bicycle to school if communities invest in supportive
infrastructure and programs. Given the uncertainty and
limitations of federal funding for non-motorized modes,
communities should develop strategies to mainstream
SRTS programs through tools available to local planners.
First, planners can articulate support for providing access
by foot and bicycle to schools through the comprehensive
plan and any linked small-area or neighborhood plans. The
goal would be to create an environment where planning for
non-motorized school access is a normal part of neighbor-
hood and transportation planning. Second, planners can
amend subdivision regulations to require or encourage the
provision of pedestrian and bicycle access to schools for
new construction or redevelopment. Third, planners can
consider access to school in the capital improvements
planning process. For example, a multiyear sidewalk com-
pletion program could prioritize investments that are near
a school or route to school. Fourth, local planners can
work more closely with school facility planners to encour-
age construction of schools that can be reached by foot or
bicycle and to identify routes to school (McDonald, 2010).
The development of an ongoing, collaborative relationship
between school and local planners could ensure that
students effectively use infrastructure investments made by
local communities. Finally, planners could pursue federal
and state funding for non-motorized infrastructure for
projects that will improve school travel. Such projects
could be designed to benefit many users, such as a multiuse
path that connects a school to several neighborhoods and
other community amenities.
This analysis has several limitations. First, we were
unable to use panel data methods to address concerns
about self-selection bias or other potential confounding
factors due to our use of fractional logit models and our
unbalanced data set. However, we address self-selection
bias by including contextual variables and estimating
models on portions of our data set and find results are
consistent with overall models. Second, the format of our
data set includes multiple observations of each school at



27/09/14 12:59 PM

162 Journal of the American Planning Association, Spring 2014, Vol. 80, No. 2



each survey date (e.g., walking in the morning and the
afternoon). We address concerns about the impacts of

dependence across these observations by using robust

standard errors and estimating additional models on a
subset of data with only one observation per time point.
Again, submodels showed similar results to the overall
models. Third, we evaluate the impact of broad interven-
tions: engineering, education and encouragement, and

enforcement. This approach reflects our goal of testing

whether SRTS interventions had positive impacts on
walking and bicycling and recognition that the selection of
particular engineering or education programs depends
heavily on local conditions that may be difficult to model.
We recommend that future research provide more detailed
case studies of how communities selected specific interven-
tions and what their impacts were locally. These case
studies would not be generalizable, but would provide
important information to practitioners.



Conclusion

The SRTS program has demonstrated significant
increases in walking and bicycling. Analysis of data from
801 schools in DC, Florida, Oregon, and Texas indicates an

absolute increase of 5.5 percentage points or a relative

change of 31% in the proportion of students walking and
bicycling to school after five years of participating in a SRTS
program. This study supports the efficacy of SRTS programs
as a mechanism for increasing active travel in elementary and
middle schools. The findings represent a beneficial extension

of the existing literature using a strong research design and a

large study area, which has not been done before, and
thereby increasing confidence in the transferability of results.
These results provide planners with strong evidence to
support strategies that make the provision of safe walk and
bicycle routes to school a normal part of the planning

process. Planners have many tools to accomplish this goal,

including comprehensive plans, subdivision regulations, and
capital improvement planning and budgeting.

Notes
1. For the small number of study schools with missing data in the
NCES, we obtained comparable information from the school district or

state education department’s website.
2. We used the block group as a proxy for the school’s neighborhood
because we believe it is most likely to correlate with the school’s attend-
ance zone without including areas outside the zone. It was not possible
to report demographics for the school’s attendance zone because many
schools do not have geographically defined attendance areas and because
we were unable to systematically collect attendance zone maps for

districts that do use them.
3. No bicycle-specific environmental measure was included because Bike
Score data were not universally available for all schools in the study.
However, the vast majority of reported active school travel was walking,
not bicycling, and therefore we do not believe the lack of bicycle-specific
environmental metrics is problematic.

Technical Appendix


This appendix provides additional detail on the study
data, model structure, estimation of marginal effects,
model results, and tests of model robustness.

Study Data

Student reports of school travel were collected at the

classroom level. Many schools conducted this survey for
multiple days; these daily counts were averaged to produce
a weekly count by mode for the trip to and from school by
classroom. The classroom estimates were then aggregated
to estimate the proportion of students walking and bicy-

cling by grade. School-level estimates of walking and

bicycling in the morning and afternoon were constructed
by averaging the grade-level estimates. This approach
standardized the reported rates of walking and bicycling by
grade, which means that differential response rates by grade
over time did not affect our results. Parent reports of the


child’s usual travel mode were available from a validated
instrument that reported travel mode to and from school as
well as the child’s grade and school (McDonald, Dwelley,
Combs, Evenson, & Winters, 2011). These individual-level
reports were aggregated in the same manner as the student

reports so that the proportion of students walking and


bicycling to school was calculated by school, survey date,
and time of day. No attempt was made to identify unique
parent–child dyads because the data sets provide no way to
link the two data sets.
Beyond data from the National Center for Safe Routes

to School, we also included information from previous

research. In Florida, mode data on an additional 40 schools
that did not receive SRTS interventions were available in
four counties from previous research by Steiner et al.

(2011). In Oregon, supplementary data were obtained
from the City of Portland, which developed their own
survey instrument to collect annual mode data, and from a
study of the SRTS program in Eugene (OR; McDonald,
Yang, Abbott, & Bullock, 2013). In Texas, mode data were
obtained from multiple resources, including the SRTS
application data submitted to the Texas Department of
Transportation and researchers’ previous research projects
(Abiodun et al., 2014; Lee, Zhu, Yoon, & Varni, 2013;
Zhu & Lee, 2009; Zhu, Lee, Kwok, & Varni, 2011).
This approach yielded an initial sample of 810
schools with sufficient data on school travel mode and
SRTS interventions. For these schools, there were 4,504
unique observations of school travel mode by school,
survey date, time of day, and data source (parent vs.
student). To ensure data quality, we dropped a number of

cases. First, we eliminated records if the reported walk
and bicycle share was 100% and information for other
modes was missing (n = 6). These surveys were dropped
from the analysis because of the likelihood of survey
administration problems (i.e., survey administrators
collected data on walkers and bicyclists only instead of all
students). Second, observations were dropped if the
reported proportion of students walking was missing
(n = 6). Third, we also dropped observations where the
survey response rates were less than 25% (approximately
the 10th percentile) and sample sizes were less than 25
(approximately the 10th percentile; n = 402) because they
may indicate nonrandom sampling. Survey response rates
were estimated as the ratio of the number of survey
respondents divided by the school enrollment. This
approach underestimated the response rate for students
slightly since it does not adjust for absences; it might also
have significantly underestimated parent response rates
since many parents have multiple children at the same
school, yet the survey instructed them to answer only for
one child. Response rates were quite high for student
reports of travel mode with a median response rate of
73% and an interquartile range (IQR) of 39% to 90%.

Response rates for parent surveys were lower, with a
median response rate for parent surveys of 14% (IQR,
5% to 26%). The final sample included 801 schools with
4,090 observations of school travel mode.

Model Structure
As described in the study, we used a fractional logit
model to estimate the impacts of the Safe Routes to School
(STRS) program (Equation 1). We modeled the propor-
tion of students at school i and time t that walked or
bicycled, yit, as a function of the presence and number of
years of SRTS interventions, SRTSit. The model also in-



RJPA_A_956654.indd 164
Vol. 80, No. 2



cluded statistical controls for the time period, Dt; neigh-
borhood characteristics, Zi; and school characteristics, Xit,
to adjust for any systematic variation in active travel based
on location, demographics, or time period (Equation 1).
The fractional logit model required, by construction, that
the outcome variable be between 0 and 1. The advantage
of the fractional logit model over other approaches to
dealing with dependent variables with limited outcomes is
that the use of a fractional logit model allowed recovery of
the marginal effects of interest; other approaches such as
taking logarithms do not allow this (Papke & Wooldridge,
1996). We analyzed the data as a pooled cross-section
because panel methods for fractional logit models with
unbalanced data have not yet been developed (Papke &
Wooldridge, 2008).

Estimation of Marginal Effects
We estimated the impacts of the SRTS program by
focusing on the marginal effects. The effect of the pres-
ence of a SRTS intervention was estimated as a discrete
effect, <U+0394>E(y|x)/<U+0394>Dsrts (Equation 2). These discrete effects
provided an estimate of the absolute percentage point
increase in walking and bicycling associated with SRTS
interventions and were computed by calculating the
discrete effect for each observation and then averaging
over the sample (Equation 2). Models also included an
indicator of the number of years since the SRTS interven-
tion was implemented. The reported marginal effect
provides an estimate of how walking and bicycling
changes for a one-year increase in SRTS program partici-
pation. The reported marginal and discrete effect of SRTS
participation was calculated for each observation and
then averaged over the sample.

As noted in the study, there were two potential
methodological concerns with our approach to estimat-
ing the effects of the SRTS program. First, there were
