     Walking and cycling to school is environmentally sustainable and increases children’s physical activity.                                                  Received 16 September 2016

     principal components [PCs]). Global Positioning System devices were used to track 623 trips to and from                                                   schoolchildren; Global

     variables, their magnitudes, and their signi<U+FB01>cance levels were found for both walking and cycling,
     independent of the operationalization. Urban form was most in<U+FB02>uential for walking, whereas distance-related
     effects were absorbed when modeled as PCs. The highest model <U+FB01>t was achieved through PCs; the
     composite measure resulted in the lowest <U+FB01>t. To maximize the effectiveness of planning and health
     interventions, walking and cycling must be targeted separately. Policymakers should avoid “one-<U+FB01>ts-all
     policies,” which are deemed to be inef<U+FB01>cient. Because urban form affects model interpretation and <U+FB01>t, careful
     attention should be paid to how urban form is modeled, and sensitivity analyses should be performed.
