was signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with AST (Medium vs. Low OR 2.68; High vs. Low OR 2.49). Adding the per-

combination with a distance to school below 2 km, no speeding traf<U+FB01>c and many paths in the neighbor-

traf<U+FB01>c volume is high (Johansson, 2006; Mitra and Buliung, 2012).
Therefore, it has been proposed to incorporate these interactions of
the physical environment in active transport research, and be more
aware of the urban form context (Moudon and Lee, 2003).
The socio-ecological frameworks suggests more than just associ-
ations on different levels, it also proposes that there may be both
moderation and mediation between and within the levels (Kremers
et al., 2006; McMillan, 2005). Yet very few studies have examined
the relationship between the urban form surrounding schools with
AST, and even fewer the roles of the perceived physical environ-
ment and social environment in this relationship (Giles-Corti
et al., 2009; Pont et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2011). Distance as a bar-
rier to AST is indisputable (Wong et al., 2011), but acceptable dis-
tances differs across countries due to both cultural and physical
environment factors (D’Haese et al., 2011). Distance could also
in<U+FB02>uence the association between AST and the physical environ-
ment, as very short distances minimize the time the students are
present in the environment, and too long distances exceeds the
physical capabilities or reasonable use of time (Panter et al., 2008).
Age and gender are other very frequent proposed moderators,
as the perception of the environment and the perceptions of risk
differ between boys and girls and between the young and the ma-
ture student. Parent support or decisions regarding AST are likely
to be in<U+FB02>uenced by the physical environment, but can also be a po-
tential moderator of the association between urban form and AST.
The decision making process of active or passive transport happens
in a dialogue between the parent and the child, and is in<U+FB02>uenced
by multiple factors from both the physical environment and phys-
ical abilities of the child (Kullman, 2010; Panter et al., 2008). As the
child matures the role of parents will shift from sole gatekeeper as
proposed by McMillan (2005), through a process of practical skill
acquisition with the environment and social interactions with
friends, to more in<U+FB02>uence from the child itself on their own inde-
pendent mobility (Kullman, 2010).
This paper seeks to extend existing research on AST by examining
the association between AST and the urban form measured by a school
walkability index and how the perceived physical environment and
social environment affect this relationship. We hypothesized that
the urban form is associated with AST, and that this association would
be mediated and moderated by the perceived environment and social
environment factors. Furthermore, we investigated whether the asso-
ciations were modi<U+FB01>ed by gender and distance to school.

2. Methods

2.1. Study population

The study included 1250 students attending grade 5 or 6 (aged
11–13 years) in 14 schools in the Region of Southern Denmark. The
present study draws data from the baseline measurements of the
SPACE – for physical activity study which were conducted in spring
2010 (Toftager et al., 2011). AST was one of the intervention targets
of the study, and schools with more than 50% of all students living
further than 2 km away were considered ineligible for inclusion.
We used a passive informed consent procedure, where students
were included unless the parents withdrew consent. This proce-
dure has been found to be ethically appropriate in low-risk re-
search in adolescents (Santelli et al., 2003). The Danish National
Committee on Health Research Ethics reviewed the study protocol
and it is registered and listed in the Danish Data Protection Agency
(reference number: 2009-41-3628).

2.2. Urban form

Relevant urban form measures for AST include attributes of the
living neighborhood of the students, the school as the destination
of Transport Geography 34 (2014) 7–15
and the route between home and school. Few studies have exam-
ined the urban form of the school site in relation to AST (Panter
et al., 2008; Sirard and Slater, 2008). In order to make comparisons
possible between physical environments in different settings, we
computed a cumulative urban form index that is an extension of
the index developed by the TREK study (Giles-Corti et al., 2011;
Trapp et al., 2011, 2012). The index in the TREK study is called a
school walkability index, and is associated with both walking and cy-
cling to and from school (boys only), and consists of two compo-
nents: road connectivity and vehicular traf<U+FB01>c exposure. We added
a third component, residential density, which was designed to
strengthen the index and suggested by the TREK study (Giles-Corti
et al., 2011). Similar to the TREK study, the ratio between the 2 km
pedestrian-enhanced network service area and the area of the 2 km
Euclidian buffer was used to assess the road connectivity of the
school site. Vehicular traf<U+FB01>c exposure, VTE, was calculated using
the Danish road classi<U+FB01>cations which divides roads into 4 catego-
ries: Roads more than 6 m wide; roads between 3 and 6 m wide;
other roads; and paths. The ratio of the length of the roads more
than 6 m wide to all other roads and paths in the walkable service
area constituted the VTE. In addition, residential density was added
as a third component, using the number of addresses divided by the
area of the 2 km pedestrian-enhanced network (Fig. 1). The three
components of the index were standardized to z-scores
(z = (x  l)/r). Then the z-score for VTE was reverse coded and
the walkability was calculated by the sum of the three z-scores.
The 14 schools were split into three groups based on the walkability
index: 4 schools with a low index (<0.60), 4 schools with a med-
ium (0.6 to 0.0) and 6 schools with a high index (>0.0) (Table 1).
As evident from Fig. 2 the categorization of the composite index re-
sulted in two groups with relative similar characteristics within the
groups (low and high index), while there were less homogeneity
between the four schools categorized as medium walkability.

2.3. Other independent variables

For statistical modeling purposes the other independent vari-
ables were categorized into three types: individual/demographic,
perceived environment, and social environment variables. The
individual/demographic variables included age, gender, household
income, parent nativity, and distance to school. Age and gender
were obtained directly from school records, and parental house-
hold income and nativity were obtained using the Danish Civil Reg-
istration System (Pedersen, 2011). Parent household income was
recoded into tertiles (low, medium and high) and nativity was
dichotomized (both parents born in Denmark or not). The shortest
distance to school was measured with the network analyst exten-
sion to ESRI ArcGIS 10.0 using a pedestrian-enhanced network
(paths and tracks included).
The perceived environment en route to school and in the neigh-
borhood was assessed using a web-based questionnaire completed
by the students at the school with teacher supervision. The ques-
tionnaire addressed overall safety en route to school and questions
on cycle paths, road crossings, car traf<U+FB01>c density and speed in the
neighborhood of residence (see Table 3 for exact wording). The re-
sponse options were on 5-point Likert scale from ‘‘strongly dis-
agree’’ to ‘‘strongly agree’’, except from cycle route safety, for
which the extreme options were ‘‘very safe’’ and ‘‘very unsafe‘‘.
The questions were developed speci<U+FB01>cally for this study and were
especially targeting conditions related to cycling. The question
about route safety was also speci<U+FB01>c to cycling, so respondents
who never cycled (10.6%) did not answer the question. The new
items were pilot tested prior to the main data collection including
cognitive interview validation (Collins, 2003; Toftager et al., 2011).
The social environment variables were also obtained from the
web-based questionnaire, and included perceived parental

between certain groups (moderation). All analyses were adjusted
for the individual and demographic variables (age, gender, parent

nativity, household income and distance to school). Model

improvement tests were performed using the likelihood ratio test
to determine if the inclusion of the additional effects (main effects
and interactions) signi<U+FB01>cantly improved the prediction of the like-
lihood of AST (Cervero, 2002; McMillan, 2007). Goodness-of-<U+FB01>t for
all models was assessed using the likelihood ratio index by McFad-
den (Windmeijer, 1995). To interpret the variation between the 14
schools an intraclass correlation coef<U+FB01>cient (ICC) was calculated as
r2
ICC ¼ r2 þ2r2 where r22 is the variance between schools (second-level
1    2
variance) and r21 is the variance between individuals approximated
2
as r21 ¼ p3 (Goldstein et al., 2002). A large ICC would indicate that
differences at the school level account for much of the variation

L.B. Christiansen et al. / Journal
in AST, and if ICC decreases in the multivariable models, it implies
that the included variables account for that part of the school level
variation.


3. Results

From the eligible population sample of 1348 students, 1250 re-
ported at least one trip to or from school and <U+FB01>lled in the question-
naire, which gives a response rate of 92.7%. In total 91.1% of the
included students reported eight or more trips and the average
number of reported trips was 9.3. A total of 61.0% of the students
reported the same travel mode on all trips, while 24.9% used two
different travel modes and 14.1% used three or more different
modes. Information about household income and parents’ nativity
were obtainable for all but <U+FB01>ve respondents, which were given the
mean sample household income and coded as native Danes.


3.1. Sample characteristics


Of all reported trips, the share of walking (including roller-skat-

ing and skateboarding) and cycling to or from school was 15.9%

and 69.5% respectively. A total of 87.1% of the students used the

bicycle at least once, and 29.6% walked at least once. Six percent

of the students used merely passive transport. There was consider-

able variation between the 14 schools. The share of walking trips

ranged from 5.8% to 31.0% and for cycling the range was 41.8% to

85.4%. The overall share of active trips ranged from 71.6% to 94.7%.

Table 2 shows the descriptive characteristics of the included

respondents and the unadjusted association with AST. One half of

the respondents were 12 years (mean age: 12.5 years), 51.7% were

boys and 9.1% had a least one non-native Danish parent. Girls and

students in the medium and high household income tertile had sig-

ni<U+FB01>cant higher odds ratio for AST (OR 1.15 CI 95% 1.03–1.28, OR

1.44 CI 95% 1.27–1.65 and OR 1.39 CI 95% 1.21–1.59). The median

distance to school for all trips was 1.2 km (range: 0.02–42.6 km)

and, as suspected, there was a signi<U+FB01>cant difference in travel

modes. For trips below 0.5 km, 1 km and 2 km, active travel modes

accounted for 97.5%, 96.1% and 93.4% of all trips, respectively, and

the active modal share was still most prevalent up to 4 km. In total

10.4% of students lived more than 4 km from school, and this was

associated with much less AST (33.3%).

3.2. Bivariate analyses

Table 3 shows the unadjusted associations between AST and the
school walkability index, perceived environment and social envi-
ronment variables. Attending schools with middle or high walk-
ability index were associated with signi<U+FB01>cant higher odds ratios
for AST. The association is non-linear in nature, and 76.6%, 90.4%
and 87.0% of all trips were made by active transport in the schools
with the lowest, middle and highest school walkability index,
respectively (Fig. 2). In total 81.5% of students perceived their route
as safe or very safe, which was associated with 90.5% of the trips
made by active transport (OR 6.35 CI 95% 5.48–7.36). More trips
were made by active modes if there were many paths and safe
crossings (OR 3.81 CI 95% 3.35–4.33 and OR 3.02 CI 95% 2.59–
3.53), while heavily traf<U+FB01>cked neighborhoods and high-speed traf-
<U+FB01>c were associated with less trips (OR 0.61 CI 95% 0.53–0.69 and
OR 0.27 CI 95% 0.24–0.31). Almost 90% of the students reported
that their friends cycled to school every day and one half reported
parents cycling weekly or parents encouraging cycling. This was
signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with more AST (OR 1.86 CI 95% 1.29–
2.68, OR 3.00 CI 95% 2.63–3.42 and OR 1.25 CI 95% 1.10–1.43,
respectively).

3.3. Multivariable analyses

To examine problems of multi-collinearity we performed a
Spearman’s test and used r > 0.60 as an indicator of collinearity.
None of the independent variables had an r > 0.60 and therefore
all were kept in the analyses. Table 4 shows the adjusted analyses
of the association between AST and the school walkability index,
perceived environment and social environment variables. We only
present the odds ratios between ‘‘unsafe’’ vs. ‘‘safe’’ and ‘‘disagree’’
vs. ‘‘agree’’ (‘‘don’t know’’ and ‘‘neither nor’’ are not shown). The
association between the school walkability index and AST was al-
most unchanged after the adjustment for both the demographic
variables and distance to school, i.e. odds ratio for medium walk-
ability changed from 2.94 to 2.76 and for high walkability from
2.12 to 2.79 (Tables 3 and 4). The inclusion of the perceived and so-
cial environment variables in the model resulted only in minor
attenuations in the magnitude of the parameter estimates of the
coef<U+FB01>cients. After inclusion of all independent variables in the
model (Model 3), the odds ratio of AST was higher for students

in the schools with greater walkability (Low vs. medium OR 2.68
CI 95% 1.69–3.77; Low vs. high OR 2.49 CI 95% 1.64–3.77). Further-

more, the odds ratio for AST was higher if the route was perceived

as safe (OR 1.86 CI 95% 1.51–2.28) and if they had many paths in

the neighborhood (OR 1.28 CI 95% 1.07–1.53). In contrast, perceiv-

ing high-speed traf<U+FB01>c in the neighborhood was associated with sig-

ni<U+FB01>cantly less AST (OR 0.50 CI 95% 0.40–0.61). Of the social

environment variables, social norm seemed more important than

parental encouragement. Students with parents cycling weekly

had higher odds ratio for AST (OR 1.92 CI 95% 1.63–2.26), and this

was also the case if their friends cycled daily (OR 1.63 CI 95% 1.06–

2.62). Safe crossings and heavily traf<U+FB01>cked streets in the neighbor-

hood together with parental encouragement did not show a signif-

icant relationship in the adjusted model.

The model improvement tests showed that the inclusion of

school site, perceived environment and social environment vari-

ables signi<U+FB01>cantly improved the model (p < 0.001) and the McFad-

den’s likelihood ratio index improved from 0.381 to 0.435. The

intraclass correlation coef<U+FB01>cient (ICC) was 8.9% for the individual

and demographic adjusted model, and attenuated to 3.1% when

the school walkability index was included in the model. The inclu-

sion of the perceived built and social environment variables re-

sulted in minor changes in the ICCs.

3.4. Interaction analyses

Table 5 shows the results of the interactions analyses in terms
of marginal effects on active trips per week. The school walkability
index categories medium and high were collapsed due to the non-
linear relationship and to simplify the interpretation of the interac-
tions. The association between AST and the school walkability in-
dex was moderated by distance, inasmuch as students living
within 0.5 km network distance from school did not differ by
school site walkability. The proportion of AST declined steadily
from 0.5 km to 4 km for the low walkability schools, but for the
medium and high walkable schools the very high levels of AST re-
mained up to 2 km before declining. The interaction with gender
and many paths in the neighborhood was almost signi<U+FB01>cant. Girls
in the low walkable schools used AST more often than boys, but
there was no gender difference on AST in the high or medium
walkability areas. Regarding the presence of many paths in the
neighborhood, a positive answer increased odds for AST in both
low and high walkable schools, but the odds increased more for
the high and medium walkable schools. Perception of safe cross-
ings in the neighborhood and parental encouragement for AST
did not show any overall sign of having a moderating effect on
the association.

improvements are tested with likelihood ratio test against full model (Table 4, model 3) and with school walkability index dichotomized (low index vs. medium to high

boys had almost the same level of AST, which is similar to other
studies with overall high levels of AST (Cooper et al., 2006; de Bru-
ijn et al., 2005; Johansson et al., 2011). In other studies, the lower
level of AST among girls is explained by more protective or restric-
tive parents (Davison et al., 2008; McMillan, 2005), and higher per-
ceptions of fear in the neighborhood among girls than boys
(Johansson et al., 2010). The tradition and culture supporting fe-
male bicycling in Denmark (Carstensen and Ebert, 2012) in combi-
nation with a suf<U+FB01>ciently active-transport-friendly infrastructure
may explain the <U+FB01>ndings of no gender difference in our study.
We hypothesized that girls would use less AST at the lowest walk-
able school sites, but the results from the interaction analysis indi-
cated the opposite, i.e. girls used AST on more trips at the low
walkable schools. One possible explanation might be found in an
earlier maturation in girls combined with lower fear of stranger
danger, which previously has been described in a Swedish study
of children’s independent mobility (Johansson, 2006).
As anticipated, distance to school was an important indepen-
dent variable associated with AST. A distance of 3 km has been pro-
posed as a reasonable maximum distance for active transport in
Belgium (11–12 years), but in this study 60.7% of all trips of 3–
4 km were still made by bicycle (D’Haese et al., 2011). This sup-
ports the hypothesis that the acceptable distance for students to
use AST varies by country and could potentially be expanded by
improving the infrastructure and creating a safer active transport
environment. In addition to being an important independent vari-
able, distance has also been proposed as an important moderator of
the relationship between AST and the environment (Panter and
Jones, 2010; Panter et al., 2008). We hypothesized a non-linear
moderating relationship with distance, where the walkability in-
dex had the lowest association when the distance was either very
short or very long. In fact, we found that within 0.5 km there was
no difference between the low and the medium/high walkable
school sites. The high level of AST remained up to a distance of
2 km at the medium/high walkable school sites, but dropped as
distance increased above 0.5 km at the low walkable school sites.
The difference did not attenuate as hypothesized for the longest
distances, implying that the school site environment also has an
association for students living further away.
The high levels of AST in Denmark has previously been ex-
plained by the persistent effort by the Danish government and
municipalities to run campaigns and safe route to school programs
(Jensen, 2008). By far most students in our sample perceived their
cycle route as safe or very safe, and this was associated with higher
levels of AST. Differences in the perceived neighborhood environ-
ment showed signi<U+FB01>cant associations with AST and may account
for variations in students AST. The three elements, paths, traf<U+FB01>c,
and crossings, which previously have been reported and theorized
to have an effect on AST (McMillan, 2005; Panter et al., 2008; van
Loon and Frank, 2011), also showed associations in our study. In
the multivariable model ‘‘many paths’’ was positively associated
with AST (p < 0.01), and ‘‘speeding traf<U+FB01>c’’ was negatively associated
with AST (p < 0.001). Additionally, having many paths in the neigh-
borhood was associated with larger increase in marginal effects in
the high and medium walkable schools (p = 0.10), indicating an ex-
tra effect where both conditions were in favor of AST. This <U+FB01>nding
supports the hypothesis of synergetic effects (Sallis et al., 2012),
and should be investigate further. Heavily traf<U+FB01>cked streets in
the neighborhood were associated with less AST in the unadjusted
analyses, but this association was attenuated in the adjusted anal-
ysis, which suggests that the speed of the cars may be perceived as
a more serious barrier to AST than the presence of many cars. A
similar attenuation occurred with safe crossings, which in addition
did not moderate the urban form association with AST.
Adding the social environment variables signi<U+FB01>cantly improved
the prediction of the likelihood of AST, but did not affect the AST

and school site association. In general, there was a strong social
norm of cycling and one half of the students perceived parental
support for cycling as well. In the adjusted analysis the social norm
was signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with AST, but parental support was
not. Furthermore, the interaction analysis with parental support
showed no moderating effect with the AST and school site associ-
ation, implying that the school site environments are associated
with AST independent of parent support.
The school walkability index presented here is a further devel-
opment of the school walkability index used in the TREK study in
Perth, Australia (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Trapp et al., 2011). Due
to a different study design and availability of other types of geo-
graphical data it was not possible to replicate the Australian TREK
study exactly. We added a residential density variable to strength-
en the index as proposed by the TREK study authors, as denser
neighborhoods <U+FB01>rst of all imply shorter distances to school for
more students. We provide further evidence con<U+FB01>rming that the
urban form around schools has an important impact on AST in a
setting where cycling to school is very prevalent, and recommend
future research to further elaborate on this relationship.
We also investigated how the perceived built and social envi-
ronment affected the AST and school site association, but found
that the association was very stable i.e. independent of the per-
ceived built and social environment urban form is associated with
AST. The puzzling question remains: why did the inclusion of per-
ceived environment variables not attenuate the association as pro-
posed in frameworks of AST (McMillan, 2005; Panter et al., 2008).
One explanation could be that the perceived physical environment
characteristics were answered from a subjective point of view,
with limited amount of knowledge about other type of environ-
ments. The student would compare his/her neighborhood and
route to school – the action space – with neighborhoods and routes
which he/she possesses knowledge about – the activity space (Hor-
ton and Reynolds, 1971).This would imply that the student com-
pares their route or neighborhood with other students in the
same environment, and not against a common reference. Another
explanation could be that the school walkability index is capturing
the environment within a 2 km walkable service area of the school.
Even though most students lived within 2 km from school, there
would be individual differences within the school perimeter, and
for the students living outside the perimeter. These general good
or poor conditions for the majority could affect the overall levels
of AST, but also explain the individual variations.
The only signi<U+FB01>cant moderator was distance to school, which
attenuated the association below 0.5 km. At the same time, this
interaction analysis supported the hypothesis that the acceptable
distance for young people to use AST is associated with urban form
characteristics: Students in this study attending medium/high
walkable schools had the highest level of AST up to 2 km from
school, while AST steadily diminished at the low walkable schools
beyond 0.5 km.

4.1. Strengths and limitations

The cross-sectional design and the enlisting of interested
schools for the intervention study make it impossible to draw con-
clusions about causal relationships and generalize the results di-
rectly to other Danish schools. The urban form surroundings the
schools were measured with a composite measure of attributes
within 2 km network distance. The composite measure cannot di-
rectly be translated to practice or general recommendations, but
was intended to increase the understanding of the interactions be-
tween urban form characteristic and other important potential
determinants of AST. The low number of participating school made
it impossible to investigate the importance of the three
components separately, or to apply interaction analyses of their

14                                                     L.B. Christiansen et al. / Journal
interrelationships. It is possible that a different scale than the 2 km

would have altered the relationships presented here (Mitra and

Buliung, 2012), but as 77.2% of the sample lived within that dis-
tance, and therefore within a 10 min cycle trip from home, we
found it reasonable to keep the distance from the original TREK

study (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Moudon and Lee, 2003).
AST was very prevalent in this study, but like other Danish sur-
veys, we found variation between schools. The high prevalence is

considered a strength of the study, as non-AST is more likely to
be caused by an intentional choice rooted in ‘‘real’’ barriers. The re-
sponse rate on 92.7% for the questionnaire and the active commut-

ing diary, in addition to the high speci<U+FB01>city of both dependent and
independent variables, are further strengths of the study. By using
trips as the binomial outcome instead of ‘‘usual travel mode’’, we

included the important information that one-third of the students
used more than one mode of transportation during a week. We
made a binary distinction between active versus passive travel,

but future research should identify determinants of different active

travel modes e.g. walking compared to bicycling. We used a pedes-
trian-enhanced network that included cycle paths and smaller
tracks to calculate the shortest distance between school and home.

However, there can still be reasons for students to take alternative
routes than the shortest routes calculated. Finally, we investigated
a speci<U+FB01>c age group, which increased the precision of the esti-

mates, but also decreased the variability and generalizability to
other age groups.


5. Conclusion


Distance to school is a very important aspect of AST, but this
study found that for distances up to 4 km cycling remained the
preferred transportation mode. The school walkability index was

associated with AST and the variation between schools was largely
explained by it. This association was barely affected by the per-
ceived and social environment, suggesting a direct relationship be-

tween AST and school walkability. We recommend that future
studies incorporate the active commuting diary to ensure high sen-
sitivity of the outcome variable and further develop the school site

walkability index approach to guide future interventions. At

schools with high walkability, promotion and education strategies
would probably be an effective strategy, while other environmen-
tal interventions are needed in low walkable school sites. Here,

interventions that would create more supportive environments,
such as speed limits, cycle paths and safe crossings, should be
investigated further.
