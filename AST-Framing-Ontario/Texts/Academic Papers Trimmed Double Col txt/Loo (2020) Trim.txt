    This study explores how short-term, school-based cycling training programs can promote cycling                          Received 21 December 2018
    among schoolchildren in the high-density city of Hong Kong. The schoolchildren’s progression in                         Revised 3 June 2019
    cycling ability was monitored closely by professional cycling coaches. Fifty-two children (aged                         Accepted 9 July 2019

    perceptions of cycling and cycling training were explored as well, with varying results. 24% of chil-
    dren reported cycling more after training, the majority of those at the introductory level, who had
    hardly ever cycled prior to training. The results suggest that cycling training has improved school-
    children’s cycling ability, while perceptions and habits of cycling have begun to change as well.
    These findings can inform future policy direction in the implementation of formalized cycling
    training for schools situated in high-density cities like Hong Kong primarily to promote cycling for
    recreation and further as a form of sustainable transport. This needs to go hand in hand with
    improving neighborhood environments so they become more amenable for active travel especially
    for vulnerable road users, such as child cyclists.
