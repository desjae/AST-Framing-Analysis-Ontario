Abstract
This literature review identified common factors associated with active transportation to school (ATS). It used a conceptual
framework of a child’s commute mode to school to classify 480 variables from forty-two studies that were tested for association
with ATS. Four factors most frequently influenced ATS: distance, income, traffic and crime fears, and parental attitudes and sche-
dules. Regular ATS results in more physical activity but research is lacking on other outcomes. Safe Routes to School, a program
designed to increase rates and safety of ATS, can use an understanding of these influences and outcomes to more effectively allo-
cate its limited resources.

from research on active transport to school in terms of
implications for SRTS and planning practitioners.


SRTS Background

Originally developed in Denmark during the 1970s in response

to unsafe pedestrian and bicyclist environments for children,

SRTS programs soon spread internationally. The first U.S. pro-

grams appeared in 1997 in Florida and New York. After numer-

ous grassroots, state-funded, and pilot SRTS programs, the

2005 federal transportation bill, Safe Accountable Flexible

Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users

(SAFETEA-LU), established a national SRTS program within

the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The FHWA

allocates money to State DOTs, which in turn award grant

money to local agencies for SRTS projects (NCSRTS 2006).

SAFETEA-LU also established a National Center for Safe

Routes to School (NCSRTS) to act as a clearinghouse for SRTS

program resources.

SRTS programs support children walking or biking safely

to and from school through some combination of the five Es:

Engineering (e.g., pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure

improvements); Education (e.g., pedestrian and bicyclist

safety courses); Enforcement (e.g., increased police patrols

near schools); Encouragement (e.g., special events or media

campaigns); and Evaluation (e.g., data collection and analy-

sis). SAFETEA-LU stipulates that each state spend 70 to 90

percent of its federal SRTS funding on infrastructure develop-

ment and the remainder on non-infrastructure activities

(NCSRTS 2006).

SAFETEA-LU allocated $612 million to the federal SRTS

program and, as of December 31, 2009, State DOTs have

announced $427 million in awards for SRTS projects.

Demand for these projects has outpaced funding. The awarded

$427 million represents less than a third of the $1.3 billion in

SRTS funding requested through grant applications (NCSRTS

2009). Some states and regional agencies provide additional

funding for their SRTS programs and SRTS stakeholders are

lobbying to expand the program with the passage of the next

transportation bill (Safe Routes to School National Partner-

ship 2009).



SRTS Evaluations
Evaluations of SRTS programs are limited. This may be in
part to the newness of the program and the few completed proj-
ects due to the lag time required for money to flow from the
FHWA to grant recipients. Additionally, SAFETEA-LU did
not mandate data collection nor evaluations of the SRTS pro-
gram (National Safe Routes to School Task Force 2008). The
NCSRTS does act as a data clearinghouse for programs that
choose to collect data and is developing a national program
evaluation plan. To date the published body of SRTS evalua-
tions consists of legacy SRTS programs—those that were
established before the FHWA SRTS program.

Rates of ATS. Three evaluations of SRTS projects in
California examined pre- and post-project rates of walking and
biking to school (Boarnet et al. 2005; Orenstein et al. 2007;
Staunton, Hubsmith, and Kallins 2003). In a convenience sam-
ple of ten elementary schools that implemented a SRTS project,
rates of walking and bicycling reported through a parent survey

declined after SRTS projects were implemented; however,

rates increased for students who passed a sidewalk or traffic

signal improvement on the way to or from school (Boarnet

et al. 2005). In an evaluation of 125 SRTS schools, only a small

number of schools reported pre- and post-project rates of walk-

ing and biking. Rates varied greatly from school to school and

depending on the data collection method. Direct observations

yielded increases from 20 to 200 percent while increases

reported through parent surveys were in the range of 10 percent

(Orenstein et al. 2007). In Marin County, public schools that

took part in a SRTS program were surveyed during the

2000–2001 and 2001–2002 school years. Six schools were sur-

veyed in 2000–2001 and seven in 2001–2002. From fall 2000

to spring 2002, researchers observed a 64 percent increase in

the number of children walking, a 114 percent increase in the

number of students biking, a 91 percent increase in the number

of students carpooling, and a 39 percent decrease in the number

of children arriving by private car carrying only one student

(Staunton, Hubsmith, and Kallins 2003). The validity of these

figures is questionable because only two schools participated in

surveys in both school years. In all three evaluations, none of

the changes in rates of ATS could be directly attributed to the

effects of SRTS programs because they were not compared to

changes in rates at control schools. Evaluations using more rig-

orous experimental designs are necessary to assess the effect of

SRTS programs on ATS.

The walking school bus (WSB)—sometimes a component

of SRTS programs—consists of an adult chaperone that walks

with children along a specified route to or from school, picking

up or dropping off children along the way. The adult monitors

children, providing regular encouragement of proper pedestrian

skills (Johnston et al. 2006). In Seattle, a WSB program

resulted in a 25 percent increase in children walking to school

(Johnston 2008). in Auckland, New Zealand, children who par-

ticipated in a WSB program walked to or from school an average

of 6.7 trips per week, resulting in an estimated 19.5 fewer cars
outside the school at the start or end of each school day (Kearns,
Collins, and Neuwelt 2003). In Hertfordshire, England, 22
schools with a total of 26 WSBs reported an average of ten chil-
dren per route, 62 percent of whom previously traveled to or
from school by car (Mackett et al. 2005).

Safety. In a California SRTS evaluation, the overall annual
rate of collisions that resulted in injury or death of child pedes-
trians or bicyclists within a quarter mile of SRTS schools declined
by 13 percent from pre-project to post-project periods (Orenstein
et al. 2007). Control areas also experienced a similar decline in
pedestrian and bicyclist collisions. These findings show that
SRTS programs are at least benign in terms of crash involve-
ment—they do not result in increased collisions. A similar

Stewart


conclusion was reached in a study that examined rates of child
pedestrian and bicycle collision in three states (Blomberg
et al. 2008). The authors of the California evaluation went on
to conclude that SRTS areas would have seen a net increase in
exposure-based pedestrian and bicyclist safety based on limited
evidence that the number of children walking and biking to
school increased at SRTS schools (Orenstein et al. 2007). They
estimated that safety benefits ranged from no net change to a
49 percent decrease in the collision rate among child pedestrians
and a 100 percent decrease for child bicyclists. They calculated
that the cost for each collision prevented by a SRTS project ran-
ged from $40,397 to $282,779, depending on the assumed
increase in ATS. These costs were greater than other road safety
improvement programs, but did not account for other potential
benefits of the SRTS program, such as decreased traffic conges-
tion and air quality near schools, increased safety for adult
pedestrians in the vicinity, and increases in physical activity
among students.
Dumbaugh and Frank (2007) reviewed the results of empirical
safety evaluations of ten pedestrian countermeasures commonly
included in SRTS projects. They found that active police enforce-
ment and physical traffic calming features, such as speed humps,
slow motorists to a degree that would reduce the frequency of
pedestrian–vehicle collisions. Sidewalks and raised medians
reduced the actual frequency of pedestrian–vehicle collisions
by effectively separating vehicular from pedestrian traffic. The
effectiveness of other common SRTS program elements was
largely assumed. Signalized crossings were found to result in
safer pedestrian–auto interactions, but unsignalized crosswalks
were found to result in more collisions. This corresponded with
research done at SRTS projects in California, where sidewalk and
traffic signal improvements were associated with improved
safety behaviors while crosswalk installation, crosswalk signal
improvements, and bicycle path improvements were not (Boarnet

et al. 2005). Dumbaugh and Frank (2007) found that school zone
flashing lights were found to reduce speeds only by about 5 mph,
with average travel speeds remaining above speed zone limits.
The safety effects of bicycle lanes were disputed. Motorist edu-
cation programs resulted in little or no behavior change. Child
pedestrian education programs were only shown to increase
safety knowledge in pencil-and-paper tests. But a Miami-Dade
County, Florida elementary school-based pedestrian safety pro-
gram was found to increase pedestrian safety knowledge in
paper-and-pencil tests and positive pedestrian crossing behaviors,
even three months after the program (Hotz et al. 2004). Finally,
no studies were found on the safety effects of crossing guards.
Research examined in Dumbaugh and Frank’s (2007) evaluation,
however, did not specifically measure the potential combined
influence of these measures or the effect of these measures on
children. Due to developmental limitations, children up to age
nine are at ‘‘considerable risk’’ of traffic danger (Ampofo-
Boateng and Thomson 1991) and the maximum vehicular con-
frontation speed for children aged six and younger is estimated
at 10 mph (Vahl and Giskes 1990). For these reasons, consider-
able safety measures may be necessary to ensure the safety of
young children walking and biking to school.

Qualitative outcomes. Agencies involved in California SRTS
projects generally felt that the program had succeeded in
improving safety for schoolchildren and for other neighbor-
hood residents (Orenstein et al. 2007). The majority of parents
at SRTS schools noticed the construction project, thought it
would increase safety, and thought it was important (Boarnet
et al. 2005). The inner-city Seattle WSB program was attrib-
uted with helping to forge a functioning parent–teacher associ-
ation at a school that had been divided across multiple ethnic,
cultural, and linguistic lines (Johnston 2008). This suggests that
walking to school with neighbor children can promote a sense
of community and trust among families. Parents involved in the
Auckland WSB programs cited personal benefits in the amount
of time saved, the removal of the hassle of driving and finding a
parking space, and knowing that children were safe. Parents
saw their children benefiting from the healthy aspects of exer-
cise, mixing with other children, and the independence of walk-
ing (Kearns, Collins, and Neuwelt 2003). WSBs do not always
result in positive outcomes. Some parental participants
reported time loss and negative social outcomes (Mackett
et al. 2005). WSBs have also been criticized as a form of social
control, since they are dependent upon parental surveillance
and are subject to adult-imposed rules (Kearns, Collins, and
Neuwelt 2003). However, interviews with WSB participants
in Christchurch, New Zealand, indicated that in addition to
many social benefits, the program encouraged children’s inde-
pendent mobility (Kingham and Ussher 2007). Unfortunately,
WSBs are difficult to maintain due to lack of volunteers, coor-
dination difficulties, persistent fears of traffic safety, and insuf-
ficient ongoing support from schools (Kingham and Ussher
2005; Mackett et al. 2005).



Method
A literature review was conducted in the summer of 2008. The
majority of articles identified in this review were cited in a
recently published review of children’s ATS (Davison, Werder,
and Lawson 2008). Additional literature was identified through
searches of PubMed, ScienceDirect, the National Transportation
Library, and Active Living Research databases using relevant
keywords. Included in this review were articles and reports pub-
lished after 2000 that presented findings from correlational
research on children’s ATS. Children were defined as aged eigh-
teen and younger. Additional SRTS resources were obtained
through the NCSRTS and the Safe Routes to School National
Partnership, an organization of SRTS stakeholder groups.
In the literature reviewed, factors influencing the choice of
ATS came in the form of variables that were tested for a signif-
icant association with ATS. To assemble the evidence, each
variable was recorded along with three possible statistical asso-
ciations with ATS: a positive significant association (p  .05),
a negative significant association (p  .05), or no significant
(p > .05) association. The measurement technique used was also
recorded for each variable. Any single article could contribute to
the evidence with multiple variables and only variables with a
reported association with the ATS were included.

Variables were first grouped into a conceptual framework of
a child’s commute mode to school based on McMillan’s (2005)
‘‘Conceptual Framework of an Elementary-Aged Child’s
Travel Behavior.’’ The conceptual framework included five
levels filtering the decision to select a specific mode of travel
and its outcome (figure 1). First were the characteristics of the
urban form at the home and the school locations, and between
the two. Second were mediating and moderating factors influ-
encing the decision. Third and fourth were the parent’s decision
and the resulting mode of travel used by the child. And fifth
were the health and other outcomes of the travel mode choice.
McMillan’s conceptual framework suggested that urban form
characteristics, such as sidewalks, crosswalks, or other features
of the built environment, had an indirect effect on a child’s
mode of transportation to or from school. Instead, given certain
urban from characteristics, a parent developed opinions about
the ability of the built environment to support different modes
of travel for their child. These opinions were called mediating
factors because they acted as intervening causal variables, or

mediators, on a child’s travel behavior. Mediating factors
included other factors that were hypothesized to have a direct
effect on a child’s transportation options, such as the availa-
bility of a car or bike. These mediating factors were moder-
ated—either intensified or diminished—by cultural norms,
attitudes, and other factors external to the immediate environment
and the trip to school. These were called moderating factors. The
interaction of mediating and moderating factors shaped the par-
ent’s decision of how a child travels to or from school.
Hypothesized outcomes of children walking or biking to or
from school included physical health improvements, air quality
improvements, and traffic congestion relief near schools during
peak commute times (National Safe Routes to School Task
Journal of Planning Literature 26(2)


Force 2008). This conceptual framework served as an outline
for examining the results of all the variables that had been
tested for correlation with ATS.
The conceptual framework was originally developed for
elementary-aged students. As such, it might be less accurate for
younger children, who likely had fewer transportation options
due to developmental limitations, and older children, who
might have more to say about their mode of travel. Some
research suggested that a child’s travel mode on the trip to
school was more of the result of a negotiation between child
and parent than that of a purely parental decision (Valentine
1997). McMillan (2005) contended that the ultimate decision
was likely to be made by the parent.
The framework identified paths of influence. Paths were
helpful for understanding possible relationships between dif-
ferent variables and ATS. However, since the vast majority
of research on the subject was cross sectional—only two stud-
ies tested change in body mass index (BMI) over time (Heelan
et al. 2005; Rosenberg et al. 2006)—paths of influence could
not be confirmed. Finally, this framework did not include paths

of feedback. It was suggested that travel mode to school, parental

concerns of traffic danger, and concerns about the risks of crim-
inal danger were interrelated (Carver, Timperio, and Crawford
2008). Parents who drove their children to school might be
attempting to protect them from traffic danger, to which they
in turn were contributing. Increased traffic danger might lead
to fewer people cycling, walking, or generally out and about
in a neighborhood. This might then lead to less familiarity with
neighbors and increased fear of danger from strangers. As a
result, other parents might fear that their child would become
a victim of crime and feel it was necessary to drive them to
school, thus further increasing traffic volume and, once again,
contributing to traffic safety fears. The conceptual framework
did not capture such complex interrelationships.
The variables associated with ATS were grouped in four of
the conceptual framework categories: urban form, mediating
and moderating factors, and outcomes. The noted limitations
of the conceptual framework were addressed by in-depth dis-
cussions of the variables grouped within each category. For dis-
cussion, variables with similar characteristics were further
grouped into subcategories.


Findings and the Implications for SRTS

Programs
The literature review identified forty-two articles and govern-
ment reports that presented findings from correlational
research on ATS (table 1).
A direct comparison of results was prohibited due to var-
ious measurements and methodologies. Most studies used
children as the unit of analysis, although one used schools
(Sirard, Ainsworth et al. 2005). Geographic scope ranged from
nationwide to school-specific. Data were obtained from a variety
of sources including parent and child surveys, transportation
diaries, physical activity recall questionnaires, census and other
government-supplied data, geographic information system (GIS)

to school at least once a week (Evenson et al. 2006). Martin,
Lee, and Lowry (2007) found that in a nationally representative
sample of children aged nine to fifteen who lived within a mile
of school, almost three-quarters of children who walked or
biked to school at least once in a week did so all five school
days. The variables they found to be significantly associated
with ATS changed very little when they changed their defini-
tion of ATS from walking or biking at least one day a week
to all five days.
From the 42 articles, 480 variables tested for correlation
with ATS were identified. Variables were classified into all
four categories of the conceptual framework; 38 subcate-
gories of variables that measured similar characteristics were
identified.


Urban Form Factors
Urban form factors were features of the physical environment
in which a child’s commute to school occurred. The conceptual
framework suggested that urban form indirectly affected a
child’s school commute mode by shaping parents’ opinions
about the ability of the built environment to support various
transportation options.
Measures of urban form variables were both objective (GIS
data or direct observations) and subjective (parent or child
surveys). For discussion, urban form variables have been clas-
sified into the following eight subcategories: distance to
school, non-motorized infrastructure, route barriers, network
connectivity, land use mix, density, walkability, and urbani-
zation (table 2).
Distance from a child’s home to school was the clearest cor-
relate of ATS. Of the twenty-two times distance to school was
examined, the only time a significant negative relationship was
not found was when children living between one half and
one mile to school were compared with children living within
1–2 miles from school (McDonald 2008b).
The strong influence of distance on ATS illustrates the con-
ceptual model. Distance from a child’s home to school is a fea-
ture of the built environment directly related to travel time to
school—a mediating factor that directly influences mode
choice. In a nationwide U.S. study, a 1-minute increase in the
time it takes to walk to school led to a 0.2 percent decrease
in the likelihood of a child walking to school (McDonald
2008a). The relationship between distance to school and the
probability of ATS was linear for trips less than a mile but
dropped to a constant low rate for trips greater than 1 mile
(McDonald 2008a). These thresholds differed slightly from
those found in Ireland, where a 1-mile increase in a child’s dis-
tance from school was found to decrease the probability of
active commuting by 71 percent and the majority of walkers
lived within 1½ miles of school and the majority of cyclists
lived within 2½ miles (Nelson et al. 2008).
In a study using San Francisco Bay Area travel diaries, six
miles was found to be the maximum distance a child would
walk or bike to or from school (Yarlagadda and Srinivasan
2008). In the same study, distance was found to have a greater
Journal of Planning Literature 26(2)


impact on travel to school than travel from school, which
suggested that pressure to arrive at school on time might result
in greater sensitivity to distance.
Distance was a strong correlate of, but not a sufficient factor
determining, ATS. In the United States, only 47 percent of the
decline in the rate of ATS between 1969 and 2001 was explained
by greater distances from homes to school (McDonald 2007a).
And nationally, of children who lived within a mile of school,
only 47.9 percent walked or biked to school (Martin, Lee,
and Lowry 2007).
The presence of various non-motorized transportation
infrastructure features—mostly sidewalks—was found to be
positively associated with ATS in about half the studies they
were tested. Five of the twelve significant associations were
found in a study that only included students who lived within
2 miles of their school (Kweon et al. 2007), which suggested
that non-motorized transportation infrastructure was more
effective at distances that could readily be walked or biked.
But other literature suggested that urban form played a
greater role in influencing trips at the margin of what was
considered walkable, while mediating and moderating fac-
tors had a greater influence on trips that could easily be
walked (McDonald 2007b).
Three studies examined the specific route a child would
travel on the way to school from his or her house (Bringolf-
Isler et al. 2008; Timperio et al. 2006; Schlossberg et al.
2006). Major road crossings were twice found to have a nega-
tive association with ATS (Bringolf-Isler et al. 2008; Timperio
et al. 2006) and steep slopes were negatively associated with
ATS for young children, aged five and six (Timperio et al.
2006). Timperio et al. (2006) also found direct routes to school
were negatively associated with ATS. The authors speculated
this was because more direct streets carried a heavier volume
of traffic, which would inhibit walking and biking.
Neighborhood characteristics including street network con-
nectivity (Kweon et al. 2007; Schlossberg et al. 2006; Mota
et al. 2007; Kerr et al. 2006), mix of land uses (Martin, Lee, and
Lowry 2007; Saksvig et al. 2007; Kerr et al. 2006; Kweon et al.
2007; McMillan 2007; McDonald 2007b), and population den-
sity (Nelson et al. 2008; McDonald 2007b, 2008a, 2008b; Kerr
et al. 2006; Kweon et al. 2007) were associated with greater
ATS. The density and street connectivity trends make intuitive
sense. Neighborhoods with dense populations and well-
connected street networks are likely to have a larger portion
of children who live within easy walking or biking distances
of schools and routes to school that carry less traffic. The sig-
nificance of mixed land use is more difficult to interpret. It is
often associated with walking for transportation in the general
population due to the close proximity of potential destinations
(Saelens and Handy 2008). For ATS, however, school and
home are the only destinations necessary. The influence of
mixed land use on ATS may be due to children and parents who
are accustomed to walking to other neighborhood destinations
and are therefore comfortable with walking or biking to school.
The links between these neighborhood urban form characteris-
tics and active transport to school was reinforced by the

f                    also associated with ATS (Yang et al. 2008). It came as no
density,             surprise that areas of greater urbanization, where these
walking-supportive urban form characteristics were commonly
was                  found, were often associated with greater rates of ATS (Fulton

136


et al. 2005; Martin, Lee, and Lowry 2007; McDonald 2007a;
Pabayo and Gauvin 2008; Schofield, Schofield, and Mummery
2005). The single study that found a significant negative asso-
ciation between urbanization and ATS was carried out in the
Philippines; the finding was attributed to lower socioeconomic
status, and therefore fewer transportation options, of rural
Filipinos (Tudor-Locke et al. 2003).

Discussion. Distance was the most consistent correlate of
ATS, and children were more likely to walk or bike to school
in dense, urban, mixed use, and highly connected neighbor-
hoods. Many of these neighborhoods may already have com-
plete and safe pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure and high
rates of walking and biking to school. These places would
benefit little from a SRTS project. But dense, urban, mixed
use, and highly connected neighborhoods without complete
pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure and low rates of walking
to school would be highly effective locations for a SRTS project.
In areas such as these, strategically placed infrastructure
improvements could fill missing gaps in otherwise robust pedes-
trian or bicycle transportation networks and low-cost non-
infrastructure activities to encourage walking and biking would
reach the greatest number of children that could potentially walk
or bike safely to school. Additionally, SRTS infrastructure
improvements in urban areas would affect the greatest percent-
age of the general population (Watson and Dannenberg 2008).
Schools in nonurban areas that tend to lack the built envi-
ronment features that support walking and biking may have a
great need for SRTS infrastructure improvements. But
because distance is such a strong influence on walking and
biking, they will get little use unless there is a substantial
child population near the school. Additionally, most SRTS
project budgets can only afford to make minor improvements
to the pedestrian and bicycle environment, not systematic
overhauls to an entire neighborhood’s street network. Smart
growth strategies to maintain existing neighborhood schools
and contain residential development within these already
built-up neighborhoods could be effective at supporting ATS
in the long term. These strategies could maintain, and eventu-
ally increase, the population of children that could safely walk
or bike to an existing school.
Sidewalks and traffic signal improvements were found to
result in increased ATS and safer pedestrian–auto interactions
(Boarnet et al. 2005). These features were also frequently found
to be associated with ATS in the correlational research
reviewed. SRTS planners should focus on these engineering
improvements but not at the neglect of a detailed assessment
to identify the unique pedestrian infrastructure needs of a spe-
cific community.


Mediating Factors
Mediating factors had a direct influence on a parent’s choice of
their child’s travel mode to or from school. Mediating factors
included direct effects of the social and natural environ-
ments—such as crime rates, traffic collision rates, or the
Journal of Planning Literature 26(2)


weather—and the way in which parents and children
interpreted their environment—such as perceived risks of
crime or traffic. Also included in this category were factors that
had a direct effect on a child’s transportation options, such as
the availability of a car or extracurricular activities that might
require additional travel. Mediating variables were classified
into the nine following subcategories: general safety, traffic,
crime, neighborhood characteristics, school characteristics,
transportation options, schedule constraints, and weather. Six
additional variables were categorized as miscellaneous mediat-
ing factors (table 3).
In the correlational research reviewed, safety concerns were
only sometimes found to have a significant negative associa-
tion with ATS. Concerns for general safety and traffic safety
were more often associated with actual walking and biking than
concerns about crime.
In almost half the studies that tested household access to
automobiles, a significant negative relationship with ATS was
found. Schedule constraints that limited transportation options,
such as after school activities or full-time employment, were
also occasionally associated with less ATS. This might be due
to parents who found it convenient to drive their children to
school on their way to other destinations or did not have the
extra time needed to accompany their children on the walk to
or from school.
School characteristics that impact transportation also
appeared to influence ATS. The most obvious example was
school policies that restricted ATS. Parents who reported a
school policy that acted as a barrier to walking or biking to
school were less likely to have children who did so (Martin and
Carlson 2005). Perceived parking problems at school were also
associated with ATS (Black, Collins, and Snell 2001). This
finding came from an urban sample of households where dis-
tances to school were generally short. In these areas, the added
time necessary to find a parking space when driving a child to
school may make non-motorized modes more appealing. Chil-
dren at public schools were more likely to walk or bike than
students at private (diGuiseppi et al. 1998; Merom et al.
2006) or alternative schools (Yang et al. 2008). Because private
schools typically draw students from a larger area, distances
from residences to private schools are likely too far to walk for
most students.
Just as children living in more walkable neighborhoods were
more likely to use ATS, children and parents who reported
what could be considered ‘‘nicer’’ neighborhood characteristics
were found to be more likely to walk or bike to school. Perhaps,
the most comprehensive measurement of a ‘‘nice’’ neighbor-
hood used in these studies was social control and cohesion as
reported in the 2003 California Health Interview Survey. In this
survey, respondents were asked how strongly they agreed or
disagreed with statements such as ‘‘people in my neighbor-
hood are willing to help one another,’’ ‘‘people in this neigh-
borhood generally do not get along with each other,’’
‘‘people in this neighborhood can be trusted,’’ and ‘‘most
people in this neighborhood know each other’’ (McDonald
2007b). These individual-level responses were transformed

study, social control and cohesion was the strongest social
environment correlate of ATS, with greater rates of social
control and cohesion associated with greater rates of ATS
(McDonald 2007b).

Discussion. Transportation options clearly influence ATS.
SRTS projects in areas with less car ownership should be prior-
itized because more children are likely to already walk or bike
to school in these places. Securing the safety of these children
that have few travel options other than walking should be a pri-
ority for SRTS programs. To encourage non-motorized trips to
school for households that do have an option, SRTS projects
should modify the school environment to ensure it supports
walking and biking and discourages children arriving in the
family car—removing any policies that discourage walking
to school and expanding bicycle parking at the expense of auto
parking, for example. District-wide policies such as courtesy
busing and school choice should also be reviewed from the per-
spective of encouraging ATS. SRTS programs should also con-
sider the broader community surrounding a school. Community
building efforts that improve aesthetics, encourage social inter-
actions, and promote outdoor activities in a neighborhood
could result in parents perceiving their neighborhood as one
that could support a walk or bike trip to school.
Because parents’ and children’s travel schedules are closely
linked (Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008), SRTS programs
could be more effective if they focus on transportation mode
shifts for the entire household, not simply children. Policies
aimed at reducing driving alone or increasing commute flexi-
bility for parents, such as commute trip reduction (CTR) and
transportation demand management (TDM) programs, might
result in greater rates of walking and biking to school for chil-
dren. Further research on household transportation patterns
could be useful for identifying broader policies that facilitate
active commuting for the entire household. In the meantime,
public participation processes could be carried out at the city,
school district, neighborhood, or school level to identify
programs that would complement SRTS programs by giving
parents the flexibility necessary to walk or bike with their chil-
dren to school.

Safety concerns were only sometimes found to have a sig-
nificant negative association with ATS. They were, however,
frequently reported. A 2004 Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) survey found that 30.4 and 11.7 percent of
parents reported traffic and crime danger, respectively, as a
barrier to their child walking or biking to school (Martin and
Carlson 2005). Traffic safety concerns for child bicyclists and
pedestrians were not without good reason. Although child
pedestrian and bicyclist injury rates have declined, it was attrib-
uted to less exposure—fewer children walking and biking—not
increased safety (CDC 2007a). Bicycling and walking were the
two most dangerous commute modes to and from school when
analyzed on the basis of exposure (Transportation Research
Board [TRB] 2002). Crime concerns may be based more on
social norms than actual risk. No trend data exist on violent
139


crimes (homicide, rape, robbery, and simple and aggravated
assault) against young children; however, the rate of violent
crime against twelve- to nineteen-year-olds has declined (CDC
2008a). From 1973 to 2005 the rate of these crimes dropped
from about 80 to 44 cases per 100,000 children (U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice 2006). Kidnapping makes up only 2 percent
of violent crimes against youth and only 4 percent of all kid-
nappings occur around schools (Finklehor and Ormrod 2000).
And children, like adults, are statistically much more at risk
of being harmed by people they know (Valentine 1997). An
English qualitative study revealed that parental concern of
‘‘stranger danger’’ was often based on media coverage of a sin-
gle case of abduction and that letting a child travel alone is an
indicator of neglectful or irresponsible parenthood (O’Brien
et al. 2000).
It appeared that practical constraints like distance and trans-
portation options were more likely to be related to walking and
biking to school than safety concerns. But this may be because
households with children that must walk or bike to school did
so despite a perception of unsafe conditions. These cross-
sectional studies cannot examine the direction of any relation-
ship. It could be that households became more aware of potential
dangers of walking and biking to school when the child actually
did so. This might explain why parents who said their child
thought it was safe to play in their neighborhood were less likely
to have children that walked or biked to school (Fulton et al.
2005).
SRTS programs must address safety concerns—real or per-
ceived. The dangers for child pedestrians and bicyclists and
the tendency for parents to react to media reports of kidnap-
pings means that SRTS programs must truly succeed at mak-
ing a safe environment for child pedestrians and bicyclists if
they are to realize a mode shift toward active transportation.
Additional research that examines the relationship between
ATS and objectively measured crime rates, traffic volumes,
or pedestrian safety indicators could be useful in determining
to what extent SRTS projects should focus on real or per-
ceived dangers.



Moderating Factors
Moderating factors encompassed all factors external to the
immediate travel mode decision. Moderating variables covered
a wide range of characteristics—from a child’s height to a par-
ent’s employment status. For discussion, these variables were
classified into sixteen subcategories: age, gender, culture (for-
eign and regional), race/ethnicity, income, employment, educa-
tion, socioeconomic status, household size (absolute, parents,
and siblings), child’s independence, attitude toward ATS, atti-
tude toward physical activity, and attitudes toward driving.
Twelve additional variables could not be neatly grouped and
were classified as miscellaneous factors (table 4).
Findings from studies that examined age were mixed. Gen-
erally, those studies showing a negative correlation between
age and ATS included only older children, aged nine to eigh-
teen (Pabayo and Gauvin 2008; Tudor-Locke et al. 2003;

Fulton et al. 2005; Evenson et al. 2003; Schofield, Schofield,

focused primarily on younger children, aged five to fourteen
(Merom et al. 2006; McDonald 2008a; Bringolf-Isler et al.

received a driver’s license, at which point ATS began to
decline (McDonald 2007b). Other researchers speculated that
older youth lived further away from their schools than younger
students, with distance being an important barrier to ATS (Ful-
ton et al. 2005). A study that distinguished between walking
with a parent and walking alone found that younger children
were more likely to walk with their mother, while older

144


children were more likely to walk alone (Yarlagadda and
Srinivasan 2008).
Girls were also found to be more likely to walk to school
when they were accompanied by their mothers (Yarlagadda
and Srinivasan 2008). In all other studies that found a signifi-
cant relationship between gender and ATS, boys were more
likely to walk or bike to school than girls.
No clear results emerged from correlational research on race
and culture. Children in the Southern United States were less
likely to walk or bike to school, possibly because of environ-
mental constraints such as hotter climates and sprawling devel-
opment patterns rather than regional cultural norms (Martin,
Lee, and Lowry 2007). Two studies using separate, nationally
representative samples initially found significant differences in
rates of ATS by racial groups, but found no differences after
controlling for several individual and neighborhood covariates
such as distance to school, household income, and density
(McDonald 2008b; Martin, Lee, and Lowry 2007).
Fewer household resources appeared to be consistently
associated with greater ATS. Income, employment, educa-
tion, socioeconomic status, and number of parents in a house-
hold were all found to be significantly negatively associated
with ATS.
Attitudes toward transportation seemed to be a factor influ-
encing ATS. Parents who had walked to their primary school
were more likely to have children that walked or biked to
school (Ziviani, Scott, and Wadley 2004). This suggested that
current efforts to encourage children to walk to school could
have long-lasting effects. Yang et al. (2008) found that parents
sometimes considered the mode of transport their child would
use for the trip to and from school when they purchased a
home. Parents who intended for their children to walk or bike
to school when purchasing a home were found to be more
likely to have children that actually used these modes. A single
British study examined the relationship between parental atti-
tudes regarding cars and the effects of driving and the preva-
lence of children walking and biking to school in urban areas
(Black, Collins, and Snell 2001). The authors found that higher
levels of individual responsibility for the environment and
lower levels of a car-centered lifestyle were correlated with
more walking. General environmental awareness had no signif-
icant association with walking and biking to school.
The relationship between attitudes toward physical activity
and ATS was less clear. Four studies found an association
between positive attitudes in children or parents toward physi-
cal activity and ATS (Ziviani, Scott, and Wadley 2004; Merom
et al. 2006; Evenson et al. 2003; Martin, Lee, and Lowry 2007).
Fulton et al. (2005) found parental perception that their child
was too overweight for physical activity was associated with
a greater likelihood of walking and biking to school. This sug-
gested that ATS was a viable option for physical activity for
children who could not easily participate in recreational forms
of physical activity. Martin, Lee, and Lowry (2007) also found
that children who participated in organized physical activities

at least once a week were less likely to use ATS. This could
be due to the need to travel long distances to sports facilities
Journal of Planning Literature 26(2)


at specific times that could make walking or biking to school
unfeasible. Most physical activity variables tested, however,
were not significantly associated with ATS.
A single study found parents’ assessment of their child’s
level of independence was positively associated with ATS
(Merom et al. 2006). Four other studies, however, found no
association between various measures of children’s indepen-
dence and ATS (Bringolf-Isler et al. 2008; Evenson et al.
2006; Fulton et al. 2005; Martin, Lee, and Lowry 2007).

Discussion. Results from research on variables that moder-
ated the parent–child decision to use ATS could help identify
locations where more students would be likely to walk or bike
to school and, therefore, where SRTS infrastructure improve-
ments, pedestrian and bicyclist safety education, and traffic
enforcement could benefit more potential child pedestrians and
bicyclists. Based on the findings related to the children’s age,
middle schools would have more potential walkers and bikers
than high and elementary schools. And based on findings from
research on income, employment, education, household size,
and neighborhood socioeconomic status, more disadvantaged
areas would likely have a higher portion of children using
active commute modes to school than their wealthier counter-
parts. The finding that children from lower-income households
or areas of greater disadvantage were more likely to walk or
bike to school was troubling considering that schools in more
impoverished areas were often surrounded by greater crime and
traffic dangers (Zhu and Lee 2008) and encountered greater
institutional barriers to accessing SRTS funding (National Safe
Routes to School Task Force 2008). SRTS administrators
should take steps to ensure that lower-income areas can access
the SRTS program.
Conversely, high income neighborhoods may be capable of
generating a greater mode switch from the family auto to active
transportation. Schools in wealthier neighborhoods could ben-
efit from SRTS projects that focused on encouragement.
Findings that girls were less likely to walk or bike to school
than boys confirmed other research indicating that girls spent
less time in the public urban setting than boys, were more likely
to be supervised; and had a more restricted home range
(O’Brien et al. 2000, Valentine 1997). SRTS projects should
direct extra effort toward supporting ATS for girls.
The conceptual framework used in this analysis suggested
that the parent played a greater role than the child in deciding
the mode of travel to school and all research on attitudes toward
travel modes to school was based on parent surveys. SRTS
projects should focus efforts on addressing parental attitudes
toward active travel. SRTS practitioners could also benefit
from research on children’s attitudes toward commute modes
and how these attitudes are related to the actual travel mode.
Further research should explore this relationship.



Outcomes
ATS has been thought to result in numerous positive outcomes,
such as reduced congestion, less air pollution, better health, and

Stewart


cognitive development (National Safe Routes to School Task
Force 2008). Physical health factors were the only variables
found to be tested in correlational research. Studies tested the
hypothesis that children who walked or bicycled to or from
school were more physically active and healthier than students
who were driven or drove. Outcome variables were organized
into four subcategories: physical activity, obesity, weight, and
fitness (table 5).
ATS was associated with more physical activity in children

and youth, especially those who regularly walked or biked to
school. Little evidence was found linking ATS with a lower
prevalence of obesity. A North Carolina survey found that ATS
was negatively correlated with BMI in sixth to eighth graders
but not in high school students (Evenson et al. 2003). Direct
obesity measurements using both BMI and skinfold tests of
fourth and fifth graders in Southern California found that boys
who walked or biked to school had a significantly lower BMI
than those who did not, but no significant relationship was
found for girls (Rosenberg et al. 2006). Several other studies
using objective measurements (Heelan et al. 2005; Sirard,
Riner et al. 2005; Tudor-Locke et al. 2003; Saksvig et al.
2007) and surveys (Fulton et al. 2005; Yeung, Wearing, and
Hills 2008) found no significant relationship between obesity
and ATS. However, surveys and other self-report methods for
measuring BMI can be inaccurate (Molaison et al. 2006).
Two studies measured the health effects of active commut-
ing over a two-year period (Heelan et al. 2005; Rosenberg et al.
2006). Neither found a significant decrease in BMI among stu-
dents who walked or biked to school. In fact, Heelan et al.
(2005) reported an increase in BMI among overweight children
that walked or biked to school.
One Danish study found that children that biked to school
were more physically fit than both walkers and students that
used inactive modes of travel (Cooper et al. 2006).

Discussion. Because higher levels of physical activity were
more commonly found in children who regularly walked and
biked to school (Sirard, Riner, et al. 2005; Fulton et al. 2005;
Saksvig et al. 2007), SRTS programs should focus on establish-
ing stable, long-term walking or biking to school behaviors.
Encouragement activities that infrequently promote ATS, like
an annual walk to school day, may be less effective at increas-
ing children’s health than activities designed to instill regular
walking and biking commute habits in children.
SRTS programs have the potential to increase children’s
physical activity but appear insufficient to address the child-
hood obesity epidemic alone. Physical activity expends cal-
ories but weight loss only occurs when calories expended
exceed calories consumed. Calorie intake was not included in
the studies reviewed. Children who walked or biked to school
may have been consuming more calories than they were burn-
ing. SRTS programs paired with nutrition education or policies
that encouraged healthy, reasonable diets for children could be
more effective at combating childhood obesity.

The studies on childhood health impacts identified in this lit-
erature review were limited to correlational research or
145


longitudinal studies that lasted only a few years. Physical activ-
ity behaviors were found to often track into adulthood (Kuh and
Cooper 1992) and transportation habits and attitudes during
childhood (Baslington 2008). This suggests that SRTS pro-
grams could have long-term benefits. Extended longitudinal
research could illuminate any long-term effects of walking or
biking to school.


Methodological Limitations and Missing

Evidence
The classification system used in this literature review proved to
be an effective tool for understanding the findings of a large
amount of correlational research and operationalizing the find-
ings in order to guide and improve future SRTS programs and
projects. The framework had methodological limitations in that
it only focused on the significance of association between a single
variable and ATS. It did not account for strengths or weaknesses
of individual study design. Another literature review on chil-
dren’s active transportation examined the methodological quality
of each publication (Pont et al. 2009). It included research on chil-
dren’s active transportation to any location and found that increas-
ing distance, income, and car ownership had convincing negative
associations with children’s active transportation while non-
white ethnic background had a convincing positive association.
Evaluations of SRTS programs in place before the FHWA-
funded SRTS program was implemented suggest that SRTS proj-
ects may result in increases in children walking and biking to
school, reductions in parents driving students to school, safer
travel behavior, no increase in child pedestrian or bicyclist colli-
sions, and increased community cohesion. Evaluations of
FHWA-funded SRTS programs using robust experimental
designs, particularly control schools, are necessary to ensure that
the requirements of this program are delivering positive results.
Detailed evaluations could help isolate particularly effective
program elements, administrative procedures, or grant selection
criteria. To facilitate this research, detailed data on SRTS proj-
ects, student travel behaviors, and child pedestrian and bicycle
collisions are necessary. The NCSRTS, State DOTs, and local
SRTS programs can all play a part in gathering these data.
No correlational research was identified that examined the
effects of walking or biking to school on hypothesized out-
comes other than physical health. The effects of greater rates
of ATS and lower rates of children arriving to school in family
vehicles have been estimated for air pollution, traffic conges-
tion, and children’s respiratory health (National Safe Routes
to School Task Force 2008; EPA 2003). But no research was
identified that explored the direct relationship between ATS
and these outcomes or on children’s cognitive development.
Research on these topics would help accurately account for the
full range of potential impacts of SRTS projects.



Conclusion
This review revealed several factors that appear to commonly
influence a child’s commute mode to or from school. Shorter

Stewart


distances from home to school, and therefore shorter travel
times for non-motorized transportation modes, were clearly
related to a greater likelihood of children walking or biking
to school. Children were also more likely to walk or bike to
school in neighborhoods that were densely populated, were
in an urban location, featured mixed land uses, and had a highly
connected street network. Findings from research that
examined car ownership, income, employment, education, the
number of parents in a household, and neighborhood socioeco-

nomic status suggested that disadvantaged areas likely had a
higher portion of children using active commute modes to

school than their wealthier counterparts. This may reflect fewer

transportation options, and therefore greater use of walk and
bike modes for the school commute, for households with lim-
ited financial resources. Another resource that frequently had
the opposite relationship with ATS was time—households with
fewer schedule constraints and more time were more likely to
have children that walked or biked to school. Favorable atti-
tudes toward active travel modes were also related to walking
and biking to school.
These factors associated with walking and biking to school
can be used by SRTS planners to identify areas where a SRTS
project would benefit a large number of children that would
walk or bike to school given the proper safety education,
encouragement, and infrastructure improvements. Conversely,
SRTS projects in areas that lack these characteristics—where
families live far from school, have ample resources, limited
time, and no interest in active commuting—would require a
substantial level of effort and resources to overcome these bar-
riers. SRTS funding is limited and SRTS project budgets may
not be sufficient to address all these barriers. SRTS planners
should assess the extent to which these factors are present in
a school-based community and develop projects that address,
or at least acknowledge, them. Whatever various barriers or
facilitators of walking and biking to school are identified in a
given community, it is clear that all SRTS projects must
address the real and perceived dangers for child pedestrian and
bicyclists.
Based on findings from SRTS evaluations, SRTS projects
may result in more children walking and biking to school with-
out increasing rates of collisions. Increases in ATS have been
shown to result in increases in physical activity for children.
Additional research is necessary to accurately assess these and
immediate results and any corollary benefits SRTS projects
may have on health, the environment, traffic congestion, and
physiological development. Additional SRTS evaluations are
also necessary to confirm the effectiveness of the program and
pinpoint project characteristics that are most effective in
accomplishing the program’s primary goals of supporting more
children walking and biking safely to and from school.
