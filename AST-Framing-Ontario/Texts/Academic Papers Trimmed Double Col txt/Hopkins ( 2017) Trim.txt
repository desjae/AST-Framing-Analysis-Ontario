     study of high school students and parents in Dunedin, Aotearoa New Zealand. Focus group sessions were
     conducted during 2014 and 2015 with students and parents separately, to explore their perceptions of
     modes of transport and transport to school decision making. Key <U+FB01>ndings relate to perceived safety, implicit
     messages, and social norms. We <U+FB01>nd that a complex range of factors contribute to perceptions of cycling
     safety, including features and perceptions of the built environment, traf<U+FB01>c safety (including behaviors of
     other road users), previous cycling experiences (including accidents), and adolescents’ cycling skills and on-
     road experiences. Overcoming concerns through behavioral and cultural interventions coupled with
     upskilling and thoughtful infrastructure may present a pathway to increasing rates of cycling.

Focus groups differ from group interviews in that the group
interactions are of speci<U+FB01>c interest and these interactions are
explicitly used to generate data and new insights into a particu-
lar phenomenon (Berg and Lune, 2012), thus they are both syn-
ergistic (Stewart, Shamdasani, & Rook, 2007) and spontaneous

“because participants are in<U+FB02>uencing, and in<U+FB02>uenced by others”
(Krueger and Casey, 2009: p.7). Due to the highly social nature
of transport and modal choice, there is a strong tradition of
focus group use for transport research (e.g. Xenias & Whit-

adolescents (e.g. Simons et al., 2013, 2014).
