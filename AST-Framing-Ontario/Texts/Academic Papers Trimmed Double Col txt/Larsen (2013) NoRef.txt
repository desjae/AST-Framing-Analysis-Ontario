Safety and School Travel
How Does the Environment Along the Route
Relate to Safety and Mode Choice?
Kristian Larsen, Ron N. Buliung, and Guy E. J. Faulkner
This study examines the relationship between safety, the built environ-
ment, and the mode of travel to and from school. The paper contributes
to the literature by analyzing the actual route traveled through the use
of objective traffic data within school neighborhoods. Parents and children
completed a survey and mapping exercise to obtain travel routes to and
from school, a methodological improvement over network shortest-path
analysis. Manual traffic counts around the sampled schools (n 5 17) were
conducted. Logistic regression analysis confirmed a priori expectations
about the effects of distance, gender, and the number of vehicles per
licensed driver. New insights into safety were produced through inclu-
sion of objective metrics designed to explore the safety of the pedestrian
environment. A higher number of vehicles, a higher number of cross-
ing streets, incomplete sidewalk networks, and the presence of parking
facilities emerged as potentially important transport supply-, design-,
and safety-related factors. If children perceived their neighborhood
to be a safe area in which to walk alone, they were also more likely to
walk. For parents, the perception that strangers were present and
the presence of busy streets influenced the mode of travel. Different
effects were produced across separately estimated home-to-school and
school-to-home models.


Over the past four decades, decreasing rates of active travel to school
have been accompanied by an increasing prevalence of childhood
obesity (1–4). The recent decline in physical activity may influence
the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity (5). Travel between
home and school presents a potential opportunity to establish daily
physical activity through active transport to school (ATS) (6). Walking
to school alone does not allow children to meet their daily physical
activity needs or meet national guidelines, but it can be one part of a
daily activity bundle necessary to produce an active, healthy lifestyle.
The distance between home and school is often reported in the
literature to be the most common correlate of school travel mode
choice (7–11): as the distance increases, the odds of walking decrease.
Distance is important, but other aspects, such as convenience and
safety, influence rates of ATS. Even for short distances, recent studies
have found that parents may drive their children to school, as it is

perceived to be more convenient (7, 12, 13). Convenience partially
relates to parental perception about the time necessary to overcome
travel distance.
Concerns about child safety are another reason why parents drive
children to and from school (8, 14, 15). The concept of child safety
is twofold; it consists of both personal security, that is, social fears or
threats to the body or mind perpetrated by others, such as strangers
or bullies, and safety from traffic. Personal security can involve
both objective and perceived risks. Common concerns for parents
are the risk of abduction, interaction with strangers, or fear of crime
(12, 16). Children, however, are concerned about strangers but may
have additional sources of fear, such as bullies, stray animals, or older
kids (14, 16). Objective and perceived measures of vehicle speed,
traffic volume, fleet characteristics, sidewalks, and street crossings
are potentially key traffic safety issues (17, 18).
Street crossings, by type, and the distribution of intersections may
also affect mode choice, but research to date has produced mixed
results. For example, higher intersection density may associate with
walking (19–21) or may not associate with walking at all (22, 23).
The type of street crossing could also be an important factor, as
major intersections may be more difficult to cross than local streets.
One study reported that many children are driven to school because
of dangerous road crossings (15), although Schlossberg et al. found
no connection between the presence of major street crossings and
mode choice (19). Railway crossings may also affect mode choice,
but little supportive evidence exists (19, 24).
The presence of a complete sidewalk network affects risk percep-
tion and has been positively associated with higher rates of ATS in
some studies (18, 25) but not at all in others (8, 24). Neighborhoods
may vary widely according to the characteristics that may support
or hinder ATS. Such differences may intensify along class divides.
For example, higher-income households commonly report lower ATS
rates than lower-income households (20, 24, 25). Although ATS rates
are often higher for lower-income respondents, the risk of pedestrian
injury has also been shown to be higher in lower-income neighbor-
hoods; income effects are therefore not limited to mode choice but
extend to safety as well (26).
Despite much discussion about safety in the ATS literature and
public policy domains, few studies have examined how observed
traffic counts and vehicle fleet characteristics associate with school

travel mode choice (8, 14, 19). The pedestrian safety literature has
found a link between higher traffic volumes and injury risk (27, 28).
The existence of such a link suggests that traffic volume may relate
to safety and mode choice. Fleet characteristics (type, size) may also
influence adult and child perceptions of safety risk. From an objective

point of view and from the perspective of the risk of injury, larger
vehicles put pedestrians at a greater risk for more severe injury and
death (29).

Methods

Study Area and Data

The study described here was set in the city of Toronto, Ontario,
Canada, which has a population of approximately 2.5 million people.
Toronto represents an ideal study area, as its neighborhoods present
contrasting transportation options, land uses, built environments,
and social characteristics. Although city form can be classified in
many ways, this study makes use of two broad categories that reflect
the historical and political context of Toronto’s growth since the
late 1800s. The central city consists of many older neighborhoods
surrounding the downtown core, and the inner suburbs include more
recently constructed neighborhoods politically amalgamated in 1998.
As part of the larger Built Environment and Active Transport
project, students in Grades 5 and 6 (n = 1,035) at 17 elementary
schools completed activity–travel behavior surveys and mapping
exercises. Student selection began in January 2010, when all ele-
mentary school principals within the Toronto District School Board
(n = 469) received an invitation to participate in the project. From
the pool of interested principals, selective sampling took place to

ensure representation by income and built environment. Nine of the
sampled schools were within the central city, and eight were in the
inner suburbs. A dummy variable broadly examined the effects of
location (central city and inner suburbs).
The University of Toronto research ethics board and the Toronto
District School Board ethics review board granted ethics approval in
advance. Individual schools, parents, and students gave consent to
participate before data collection. Data collection took place in the
spring and fall of 2010 and 2011. Grades 5 and 6 teachers recruited
children and parents. Eligible students obtained a consent form asking
for the child’s home address. Home addresses and school locations
were used to produce color maps (aerial photographs) of participant
neighborhoods on ledger-size paper (279 × 432 mm).
After in-classroom instruction, children brought home a parental
survey and a map on which they could draw (with parental super­
vision) their typical route to and from school. The child and parent
surveys allowed researchers to examine how perceived characteristics
of the neighborhood and safety relate to mode choice. All questions
about safety and environmental perceptions were entered into a
preliminary univariate analysis to test for associations with mode
choice (Table 1).

Heads-up digitizing generated geographic information system-
based separate routes to and from school. Data loss resulted from
incomplete or illegible maps. The final data set included 978 routes to
school and 981 routes from school. The digitized routes allowed explo-
ration of objective environmental characteristics along each child’s
reported route. Most studies examining school travel use aggregated
data for either the home or the school neighborhood (8, 9, 20, 21), and
a few recent studies have examined characteristics along the shortest
path between home and school (19, 24). Use of a drawn route as the
unit of analysis is a methodological improvement over previous work
and produces a more accurate representation of the environment (30).
The City of Toronto provided data on sidewalks, railways, street
trees, traffic-calming device location, and the street network. These
data were used to construct route-based environmental variables.
Parcel-level land use data from the Municipal Property Assessment
Corporation were also used to generate land use metrics. Researchers
verified all of the data sets along the routes in this study with the
assistance of aerial photography and field visits, when required.


Built Environment

This section explains the approaches used to model concepts of the

built environment. Several measures of transport supply and the

density of route features were estimated (i.e., the number of features

per route kilometer). These included crossed intersections, active

railway crossings, major street crossings (major streets were classified

by the City of Toronto), traffic-calming devices, and street trees.

Few studies examine how traffic-calming features influence school

travel. Traffic-calming devices in this study included chicanes, speed

bumps, raised intersections, gateways, raised crosswalks, and traffic
circles. Street trees may encourage walking for the trip to school (9).
Calculation of the number of street trees along each route was based
on the distance traveled, and this calculation produced a variable for
route street tree density.
Sidewalk availability is assumed to be necessary for the facilitation
of ATS. Sidewalk coverage was measured as the proportion of a route
with missing sidewalks. Sidewalks were considered to be missing
only if they were not present on either side of the street.
Land use mix is often measured by use of an entropy index based
on the area of land dedicated to particular land uses (9, 24). This study
examined the actual route traveled and not the area surrounding the
home or school. Thus, a new route-based approach examined the
mix of land uses along the property frontages for each child’s route.
This method uses the same approach as previous work but uses it at a
different spatial scale because of the route-based nature of this study.
All land parcel polygons within the city of Toronto were classified into
five land use classes (parks, residential, institutional, industrial, and
commercial). Land use parcels were then transformed into linear fea-
tures at the front of each property. The total length of frontage for each
land use was compiled for every route, and an entropy approach was
used to represent land use mix (LUM) by use of the follow formula:

LUM = -
<U+2211> lu [ pu ln ( pu )]

ln ( n )


where

lu = land use classification integer,
pu =	proportion of parcel frontage within a land use category, and
n = total number of land use classes.
Transportation Research Record 2327
The values ranged from 0 to 1, where 0 represents a route populated
by a single land use and 1 indicates the presence and equal distribution
of all five land uses.
Many participants did not provide individual-level data on income
when completing the survey but did report their level of educational
attainment. Preliminary analysis included the individual educational
attainment variable along with a measure of the median household
income at a scale smaller than the neighborhood (i.e., the Canada
census dissemination area [DA]).


Traffic Environment

Qualitative research examining traffic and school travel has reported
a relationship between the number of vehicles around the school and
safety (17). School travel interventions often focus on the traffic
environment at the school end. Manual traffic counts were taken at
all access and egress points around each sampled school. These counts
produced a destination-focused analysis of the role of traffic on mode
choice. This approach to data collection ensures that traffic data are
available for at least one intersection for every child. Traffic counts
were conducted in the morning and afternoon. Data were collected

by methods used by Boarnet et al. and commenced one-half hour

before school started in the morning and continued for another

15 min after school began (18). The same approach was applied for

the journey home from school, in which data collection commenced

15 min before the end of the school day. In agreement with common

practice, data collection took place only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,

and Thursdays; Mondays and Fridays have atypical traffic patterns

(31). Traffic data were collected only in the spring and fall and were

not collected on days with poor weather. The counters were also
instructed to record data on vehicle type, and training was given in
advance to help the counters distinguish different vehicles.
This study used the observed traffic data in novel ways. Two
measures of the traffic environment were used. The first measure
was the traffic volume (observed count) experienced at the school
end by examination of the maximum volume that a child faced at
those locations where his or her route intersected with a data col-
lection point. This approach takes into consideration findings from
the pedestrian safety literature in which a greater volume correlates
with perceived safety risk (27, 28). This correlation assumes that
differences in volume at the high end most likely associate system-
atically with safety and mode choice. For the second measure, tests
also examined traffic density at the school end to understand how
average traffic volume influences mode choice.
To date, no known study has examined how fleet characteristics
relate to either mode choice or safety. It is unknown exactly how
this particular aspect of the traffic environment interacts with safety
perceptions or mode choice. Perhaps, for example, a disproportionate
presence of larger vehicles could produce differences in perceived
safety and mode choice. Passenger car equivalents are a common
measure used in the transportation demand and forecasting literature

to model the impact of larger vehicles on road systems. No known
vehicle index or multiplier for linking vehicle fleet characteristics

with pedestrian safety exists. This study involved experimentation
with a vehicle weight-based multiplier to create a car equivalent for

the pedestrian safety application. The difference between smaller and
larger motor vehicles in pedestrian safety relates to vehicle mass
and speed. Fleet size plays a role in vehicle-on-vehicle collisions,
as a direct inverse relationship between the mass of the vehicle and

Larsen, Buliung, and Faulkner
risk of fatality exists (32). The following multipliers were applied:
1.0 for a car, 1.3 for an SUV or minivan, 11.2 for a bus, 6.1 for a
school bus, and 13.2 for a truck (33, 34). The mass of a bus, school
bus, and truck can differ substantially on the basis of the number of
occupants or the load. For these types of vehicles, the multiplier uses
the average weight between a full and an empty vehicle. The average
weight thus implies that a bus or a truck is at half of its capacity.
A weighted vehicle fleet index examines the characteristics of the
vehicle fleet around each school. Observed fleet data were aggre-
gated to four vehicle categories: passenger vehicles, transit vehicles,
school buses, and trucks. Passenger vehicles included cars, minivans,
and SUVs. A reverse entropy index models the vehicle mix around
each school:


<U+F8F4><U+F8F1> <U+2211> v [ pv ln ( pv )] <U+F8F4><U+F8FC>
fleet mix = <U+F8F2>                         <U+F8FD>+1
<U+F8F4><U+F8F3>      ln ( n )      <U+F8F4><U+F8FE>

where

v = vehicle type,
pv =	proportion of vehicle types at each intersection dedicated to
a particular category (i.e., passenger vehicle, transit vehicle,
school bus, or truck), and
n = total number of categories.

Fleet mix scores ranged from 0 to 1, where 0 is a mix dominated

by trucks, transit, and school buses and a score of 1 represents an
intersection with only passenger vehicles. To further test for fleet
effects, in a preliminary analysis an unweighted vehicle mix index
that applied the same approach but without vehicle type multipliers
was tested.
Few studies to date have examined whether parking or drop-off
facilities at the school relate to mode of travel. It is unknown how
this feature associates with mode of travel, but it is likely that these
facilities encourage driving because they make it easier. Site visits
to each school surveyed parking facilities and drop-off locations.
Schools were coded as having parking facilities if pickup and drop-
off zone signage was observable or if a school had a drive-through
area in front of the school for drop-off and pickup.


Empirical Analysis and Modeling

Univariate logistic regression was first used to determine variables
independently associated with walking (Table 1). Factors such as
distance and the genders of the child and the parent, along with auto-
mobile availability, were analyzed to control for these individual
characteristics of the child and adult. Variables continued into sub-
sequent analyses by use of a p-value cutoff of <.05. For categorical
responses, three of the four categories had to meet the criterion of a
p-value of <.05 and the other category had to approach significance
with a p-value of <.1. In an ideal situation, a multinomial analysis
would be completed; but the number of cases for bicycling, transit,
and school bus (n = 58) did not allow such modeling. Only children
who were driven in a vehicle or walked to and from school (n = 905)
were included in the analysis. Although only 22 students rode a
school bus, all Toronto District School Board students living more
than 1.6 km from school are eligible to take the school bus. The
Toronto District School Board measures the distance along the short-
est public thoroughfare from the child’s residence to the closest school
access point.
13
Multicollinearity analysis of the filtered set of variables followed
the unadjusted modeling exercise, and Pearson correlations and
variance inflation factor approaches were used. These tests discov-
ered multicollinearity for the traffic maximum and density variables
along with the weighted and unweighted vehicle fleet mix. Because
preliminary testing revealed greater significance for the maximum
traffic and weighted vehicle fleet index variables, these variables
remained in the adjusted models.


Model Specification and Structure

Binomial logistic regression modeling examines how charac­
teristics of the traffic environment relate to mode of travel with
walking as the dependent variable. The purpose of these models
is to help explain how perceived and objective measures of traffic

and safety associate with mode choice. Recent studies have shown
different patterns in the trip to school versus the trip from school
(10, 24), so separate models were estimated for trips to and from
school.


Results

Descriptive statistics for the cases included (n = 905) are reported in
Table 2. Nearly 68% of the children (n = 654) walked to school and

26% were driven (n = 251). Although not included in the analysis,

only 22 children (2%) rode the school bus, 19 cycled (2%), and 17 took
transit (2%) to school. For the trip home, rates varied slightly, with
76% of children walking (n = 733) and 18% being driven (n = 173).
Alternative modes remained stable, with 2% of the children in the
sample biking, taking transit, or riding a school bus home from school.
The average age of the sampled children was 10.5 years. Fifty-four
percent of the respondents were girls (n = 482) and 46% were boys
(n = 516). A total of 456 respondents lived in the central city (50%)
and 448 (50%) lived in the inner suburbs; 436 (49%) students were
from high-income neighborhoods, and 468 (51%) were from lower-
income areas. Nearly 60% of the sample had access to parking
facilities at the school (n = 533). More than 50% of the fathers and
46% of the mothers had a university degree.
The median distance for each of the trips to and from school was
634 m, and the mean distance varied slightly (895 to 900 m). Any
difference in trip length to and from school relates to the different
routes taken for these trips. Most respondents had to cross five streets,
but few of these streets were classified as major roads. Traffic-calming
features were present for some of the routes, but many routes did not
include these devices (n = 638). The values for land use mix were
quite low. The low value means that single land uses dominated the
landscape for most routes. The traffic environment was different
during the trips to and from school. More vehicles were around
schools in the a.m. period, and most of these vehicles were passen-
ger vehicles. This likely relates to the higher rates of driving during
the trip to school, as rates of driving are higher for the trip to school,
and most children are in passenger vehicles.


Regression Models

As expected, distance emerged as one of the strongest correlates of
school travel mode choice (Table 3). As distance increased, the odds
that a child would walk decreased. Child gender was also a significant

factor, as boys were more likely to walk. These results were consistent
for both trips. School neighborhoods also played a role, as living in
inner suburban areas decreased the likelihood that a child would walk.
For class, the median household income of the home DA was
significant only in the model of the trip home from school. House-
holds in DAs described as having a higher income than other places
seemed to produce less walking on the trip home. The number of
vehicles per licensed driver ratio was significant only for the trip to
school and was inversely related to the odds of walking. The number
of intersections along the route significantly related to travel mode
for both trips, but the need to cross major streets produced no effect.
Children faced with routes with many intersections, irrespective of
road type, were less likely to walk. The absence of sidewalks was
also associated with a decreased odds of walking. Route-based
measurement of street trees, traffic-calming features, and land use mix
were not statistically associated with the mode choice outcome. It is
possible, however, that other approaches to measuring these features

in relation to mode choice—or route choice, for that matter—could
produce a different result.
For the traffic environment for the trip to school, increased traffic
volume at the school end appeared to decrease the odds of walking.
Although this may appear to be an expected result, it was significant
only for the morning trip. Informed by the preliminary univariate
analysis, vehicle fleet index was entered only into the model for the
trip to school and was not significant. The finding suggests that for
the characteristics at the school end, mode choice may not relate to
vehicle fleet mix; the greater concern may be traffic volume overall.
Parking facilities were also important only for the trip to school,
indicating that the presence of parking facilities may enable driving
in some way. Overall, the larger number of significant variables in
the model for the trip to school may suggest that the traffic environ-
ment around the school has a larger and potentially more diverse set
of impacts on mode choice for the trip in the morning than for trips
from school at the end of the day.

16
Attention to the findings for environmental perceptions showed
that the odds that children would walk to and from school appeared
to be higher for children who perceived that they lived in an area
where it is safe to walk alone. Parents’ heightened risk perception
about strangers appeared to correlate inversely with the odds that
their children would walk on both trips. In contrast to findings about
the objective measurement of the traffic environment, the perception
of heavy traffic around the school was not significant for either trip.
Also in contrast to a corresponding objective measure, strong parental
agreement on child interaction with too many busy street crossings
inversely related to the odds that the children would walk. An inter-
esting finding was the incongruence between objective environ-
mental measurements and the respondent’s perception of the same
environment.


Discussion of Results and Conclusion

Traffic, measured according to the maximum volume at intersections
where child pedestrian exposure occurs, was a significant factor
related to mode choice. This finding is important, as few studies
have examined this variable within the context of travel to and from
school. Some studies have used aggregated daily counts, but no
known study has used traffic counts around the school during the
a.m. and p.m. periods. Findings for this variable were not surprising,
as a higher traffic volume at an intersection translates to decreases
in walking. A higher number of vehicles could produce an unpleas-
ant walking environment. From a safety standpoint, a higher traffic
volume could also be associated with an increased risk of pedestrian
injury or death. This finding confirms that a link exists between the
traffic volume at the school end and ATS.
Although the maximum traffic around the school was significant for
the trip to school, it was not for the journey home. This may relate to
several differences in the trips themselves. Fewer vehicles were found
around the school on the trip home from school. Two reasons for why
this may occur exist. The start of the school day begins to overlap
the start time of work for many parents, so the morning peak hour
coincides with the commencement of school. This coincidence of
starting times means that people driving to work will be adding
vehicles to the roadway in the morning. Additional vehicles around
the school in the morning may also relate to the difference in the
rates of driving for the morning and afternoon trips. A nearly 10%
increase in the rate of people driving to school over the rate of driv-
ing from school was found. The difference between the two trips
does not suggest that traffic is not important on the trip home but,
rather, that it is more significant in the morning, when traffic volumes
are higher. It appears from this finding that traffic and other envi-
ronmental features are less important on the trip home from school,
when more people are walking. This likely relates to parents’ work
schedules and their inability to pick up their children after school.
Although unintended, the lack of synchronicity between school and
adult paid work at the end of the day may limit the transport options
available to households. This could produce an overall reduction in
traffic volumes at the school end and a more temporally fragmented
arrival of those parents, who drive their children home or elsewhere
at the end of the school day.
Fleet mix around the school did not appear to associate with
mode choice. This lack of an association does not mean that fleet
mix should be universally ignored with regard to the school travel
problem. It could affect route choice, and fleet mix around the
home may influence mode of travel. Moreover, and from an injury
Transportation Research Record 2327
perspective, vehicle type and size and vehicle speed are of concern.
To ensure that methods captured this variable effectively, prelimi-
nary analysis tested two measures of the vehicle fleet mix. Because
little work on this topic has been performed to date, it was unknown
what approach would best capture the conceptualization of vehicle
mix. The weight-based index was entered into the regression analysis
because it possesses strong conceptual links with the injury problem;
it was also a stronger correlate in preliminary analysis. The odds ratio
from the vehicle fleet index suggested that in neighborhoods where
passenger vehicles dominated the traffic environment, children were
more likely to walk, but the finding was not significant. The reasons
for the null finding could relate to the dominance of passenger vehicles
in the school traffic environment. In general, it seems that a reduction
in the number of vehicles may be more important than the vehicle
fleet, but more research is necessary.
The availability of a designated place to pick up or drop off chil-
dren in the morning increased the odds that a child would be driven
to school. Few studies have examined this feature, but this study
provides some evidence of a link between parking and increased
driving. This study examined only designated parking facilities.
Staff parking lots or nearby streets may act as unofficial drop-off
or pickup zones. The fact that parking matters demonstrates that
formal parking facilities do encourage driving. An official drop-off
zone may relate to what parents perceive to be the most convenient.
From a policy standpoint, it is unlikely that merely removing these
designated areas would encourage walking in the short term, as
many parents would merely park in nearby areas, but more research
on this topic is also needed.
Missing sidewalks negatively influenced rates of walking to school.
Many studies have examined how sidewalks associate with ATS,
with mixed results being obtained to date (18, 21, 24). These mixed
findings likely relate to complete sidewalk networks around schools.
Although most neighborhoods in Toronto have a complete network,
a few areas do not. Findings from the present study suggest that
when this feature was missing, the odds of walking decreased. This
finding directly translates into policy applications related to sidewalk
development; that is, no new development should take place without
the construction of a complete sidewalk network. School travel alone
probably provides an insufficient business case for sidewalk devel-
opment, and so the broader benefits of the infrastructure require
communication to influential stakeholders.
Several features, such as major street crossings, the presence of
traffic-calming features, and land use mix, were not significant
factors for mode choice; but they may be associated with the route
that children travel. People likely avoid features of the environment
that are less pleasing and plan their routes along quiet streets.
When the route required children to cross major streets, a higher
density of traffic-calming devices and mixed land uses were not
related to the mode of travel. This result should not suggest that
these features are not important to the environment, nor should
it suggest that they are unrelated to school travel. These environ-
mental features did not associate with mode choice for several
reasons. The purpose of this paper was to examine mode choice
and not route choice. The insignificance of the presence of major
street crossings likely relates to the fact that many people did
not have to cross busy intersections. As indicated in Table 2, the
median number of major streets crossed was 0, suggesting that many
routes avoided major intersections.
Children likely intentionally travel along routes on which they
do not have to cross many busy streets to make the trip more
enjoyable. A similar story likely exists for traffic-calming devices.

Larsen, Buliung, and Faulkner
Traffic-calming features are supposed to slow vehicles, improve
perceptions of safety, and reduce the frequency of collisions for
walkers (35), although their effectiveness at reducing pedestrian
injuries is inconclusive (36). These devices are installed on busier
streets where it is thought that driver behavior could be modified
through design interventions that produce a potentially more benign
traffic environment. Little work on school travel has examined this
variable, but the null finding may relate to the fact that many chil-
dren are selecting a route along quieter streets, where speed bumps
or other traffic-calming devices are not necessary or where the
earlier installation of these devices has produced a desirable walking
environment. Similar to the reason why major street crossings were
irrelevant, these features influence the routes traveled but not the
mode. Future work should examine how children and parents select
their routes to and from school to obtain a better understanding of
how environmental features influence these decisions.
Characteristics of the social environment were also important.
Children living in lower-income households were more likely to
walk home from school than those living in high-income households.
This finding relates to previous work, as many studies have found
that children from higher-income households have lower rates of
ATS (10, 24). Because this characteristic was significant only for the
trip home from school, a connection between income and the parents’
work schedules likely exists. Higher-income families may have
only one parent working or a parent or parents with flexible work
schedules, a household labor scenario that enables more driving.
The ability to afford an automobile also typically more readily applies
to higher-income households, which generally have higher rates of
automobile ownership and use (37).
Child and parent perceptions also influenced the mode of travel.
Initial analysis revealed that most of the questions from the child
and parent surveys pertaining to safety were not significantly asso-
ciated with school travel (Table 1). Social fears about strangers
and older kids, along with perceived traffic, were not statistically
significant for children. This may relate to how children answered
or understood the survey, or the questions themselves may also not

have represented children’s concerns. It could also be the case that
because the risk perceptions of adults ultimately determine mode
choice, the risk perceptions of children did not directly correlate
with a mode choice process largely controlled by parents. The only

perceived factor from the child respondents that was statistically
significant was living in an area where it is safe to walk alone. On the
basis of findings from the objective variables, sidewalks, traffic, and
intersections may play a role in enhancing children’s risk perception;
but more work needs to be done to determine the extent to which this

is the case. Irrespective of design features, feeling safe was important
for children.
Heightened parental perception of child pedestrian risk of injury
or death from strangers or busy street crossings appeared to limit

the odds that the child would walk. It appears from the presence
of contrasting findings on the objective and subjective assessment
of environmental risk factors that parents’ ideas about the planned
and engineered environment differ from professional expectations
of precisely how the built environment affects school travel. This

kind of asymmetry between the language and concepts of planning or
engineering and everyday life represents an important opportunity
for education and outreach that probably requires some additional
attention in the context of school travel planning and policy.

Beyond previously discussed contributions, this study uniquely
focused on the reported (mapped) routes traveled rather than a
modeled network shortest path or aggregated buffers. This focus
17
enabled a more fine-grained exploration of the characteristics that
children and parents might actually experience or perceive to be
enabling or threatening environmental qualities on the trip to and
from school. Previous work has determined that safety concerns
are common reasons why children are driven, but few studies have
examined the actual characteristics and perceptions of safety.
This study also collected data on the traffic around the school to
improve the evidence base about the relationship between different
qualities of the traffic environment at the school end and school
travel mode choice. Traffic volume related to mode choice for the
journey to school, and the null finding for traffic mix suggests that,
overall, volume is potentially more problematic than vehicle type
in regards to mode choice. That is not to say that vehicle type is not
important in the context of pedestrian injury or death. Evidence from
this study supports the reduction of the numbers of vehicles around
schools. School-based policies should aim to remove designated
drop-off zones to reduce the number of vehicles around the school
and encourage ATS.
