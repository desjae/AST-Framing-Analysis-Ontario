Abstract
Neighborhoods walkability has become an important public health concern. The child’s-eye view of safe and walkable
environments is typically remiss from the literature. Particularly the experience of inner city kids, very different from that of
suburban neighborhoods, remains unreported. The study reported here offers new insights based on the walking to school
experience reported by the children of inner city neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Interviews with fifth-graders from five grade
schools suggest that the dangers in their social milieu are a much greater concern for them than the physical milieu, which
the walkability research typically emphasizes. The findings necessitate new policies.

public health perspective. The rapid increase in childhood
obesity over the past two decades is a cause for serious con-
cern about adverse health outcomes (i.e., hypertension, type
II diabetes, depression, etc.) and a consequent increase in
health care expenditure associated with childhood obesity. In
recognition of school travel as an important opportunity for
promoting daily physical activity among children, policy-
makers have put a special emphasis on promoting walking or
biking.
With growing dependence on motorized travel, children
now spend a considerable amount of their waking hours in
the backseat of automobiles driven to and from organized

activities even for a short distance. This trend is most evident
in children’s school travel. Whereas 48 percent of children
between the ages of five and fifteen walked or biked to
school in 1969—the time when Dyckman, Lynch and others
wrote about inner city urbanism—it has now decreased to
less than 16 percent (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
2003). Yet despite a considerable decrease in the rate of
walking, safety of child pedestrian remains a concern.
Pedestrian injuries remain the second-leading cause of unin-
tentional injury-related death among children, disproportion-
ately affecting ethnic minority children from low-income
families (National SAFE KIDS Campaign 2004). Particularly,
a substantial number of pedestrian fatalities and injuries
among school-aged children occurs during normal school
travel hours, making walking the second most dangerous
mode of travel after biking on a per mile basis (Transportation
Research Board 2002).
These safety concerns have led to several policy measures
at the federal and state levels. California was the first state in
the United States to implement a statewide Safe Route to
School (SR2S) program in 1999. A new federal program,
earmarked specifically for children’s safe and active school
travel, was established in 2005. This legislation promised to
provide $612 million to the state’s SR2S program over five
fiscal years, largely supporting physical improvement proj-
ects to date.1
Detractors of current interventions, however, argue that
public investments so far do not always reflect a sound under-
standing of factors that influence children’s travel generally,

and walking to school in particular (McDonald 2006;
McMillan 2005). The current state of knowledge on children’s
travel behavior is quite limited, and supportive policies for
improving walkability of urban space are primarily derived
from adult caregivers’ (usually parents’) attitudes and choices.
Children’s needs and perceptions are often subsumed by
parental concerns and preferences, and those in turn become
the proxy measures of children’s propensity to walk to school.
The essential premise of this paper is that children are active
agents in managing and negotiating their movement within the
context of opportunities and constraints offered by the proxi-
mate built environment. Although some of the earlier works
like the ones by Lynch (1976) and Chawla (2002) attempted to
understand how children perceived, used, and valued their
Journal of Planning Education and Research 34(2)


proximate environment, the recent literature on walking to
school are remiss of the child’s-eye view of safe and walkable
environment. The study reported in this paper addresses this
lacuna, and offers new insights based on ten walking to school
experience as reported by the children living in inner city Los
Angeles neighborhoods. The children who participated in this
study were all fifth-graders, from five grade schools—four
public and one parish—in the vicinity of the University of
Southern California (USC) campus and Exposition Park, con-
sidered a part of South Central Los Angeles.


Research Questions

Our research questions address some of these lacunae:

•• How do children perceive safety in their proximate
environment and the various appeals and barriers in
their experience of walking to school?
•• What are the relevant policy measures for the improve-
ment of children’s propensity to walk by mitigating
actual and perceived risk?
•• What are the risk and modifying factors associated
with children’s current school travel at the individual,
household, and neighborhood level?

The existing research suggests that a set of nested, inter-
connected elements at individual, household, community,
and institutional/policy level collectively influences the pro-
pensity of children’s outdoor activities in general and walking
to school in particular. That is, environmental risk elements
involving both the built environment (traffic, land use, pollu-
tion, etc.) and the social milieu (crime, drugs, gangs, etc.)
influence children’s as well as parents’ perception of risk,
which is then modified by household, community, and insti-
tutional supports (such as social programs and services).
What follows is a brief summary of children’s travel
behavior pertinent to walking and risks and modifying fac-
tors that are likely to influence the safety of child pedestrians
at individual, household, institutional, and community level.


Children’s Perception of Safety and Spatial Behavior

Children’s experience, perception, and behavior in geo-
graphical space have long been of interest to scholars from
several disciplines. Environmental psychologists have typi-
cally focused on the “lifeworlds” of children (see Aitken
1994; Matthews 1992). Studies suggest that this lifeworld is
negotiated between child, parents, and their environment
(Perez and Hart 1980). Moreover children’s spatial move-
ment, or “license” (c.f. Hillman, Adams, and Whitelegg
1990; Spilsbury 2005; Risotto and Tonucci 2002) to move
around independently is influenced by several attributes: age
and sex of the child (Hart 1979; Hillman and Adams 1992;
Matthews 1987); ethnicity and other sociocultural character-
istics of the family (O’brien et al. 2000; Valentine 1997a);

Banerjee et al.


parents’ (especially of mothers’) psychosocial milieu (i.e.,
sense of community, perceived safety or danger, social net-
work, etc.) (Blakely 1993; Prezza et al. 2001; Valentine
1997b); and the characteristics of the proximate environment
(Kyttä 1997; Mattsson 2002; O’brien et al. 2000).
Some of this literature suggest that children are often
more competent in managing their own personal safety than
parents would normally believe. Furthermore, children often
actively engage in negotiating their parents’ understanding
of their environmental competence. (Valentine 1997b)


Propensity to Walk and Active Living

Although considerable knowledge has accumulated primar-
ily from child pedestrian safety and accident prevention
studies (e.g., Christoffel et al. 1991; Mayr et al. 2003; Roberts
et al. 1995), very little is known about what would encourage
children to walk in the first place. The following presents a
brief review of walking behavior (not necessarily of chil-
dren) from different disciplinary approaches.
The likelihood for individuals to walk has been empiri-
cally tested for different neighborhood types (Handy 1996;
Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian 2006; Moudon et al. 1997;
Shriver 1997); land use pattern (Cervero and Duncan 2003;
Cervero and Kockelman 1996; Frank and Pivo 1994;
Greenwald and Boarnet 2001); street network, including
accessibility and connectivity (Cervero and Duncan 2003;
Cervero and Kockelman 1996; Krizek and Johnson 2006);
and pedestrian environment features (Alfonzo et al. 2008;
Rodriguez and Joo 2004). This literature provides evidence
of a correlation between various aspects of the built environ-
ment and adult walking trips. Children however are consid-
ered simply as trip generators who influence the amount of
household travel (especially of mothers) and range of travel
options (see McDonald 2005b).
Unlike urban and transportation planning studies that have
considered walking for the utilitarian purpose of transport,
health researchers traditionally have exclusively focused on a
different subset of physical activity—walking for recreation
(Sallis et al. 2004). Over the past decade, the field of physical
activity research has been evolving rapidly to widen their hori-
zon by embracing the idea of “active living” that incorporates a
broader range of physically active behaviors (e.g., occupational
or utilitarian activities) and by expanding its focus beyond indi-
vidual and cognitive domains (Sallis et al. 2006). In order to
incorporate various factors that may influence behavior, eco-
logical models that encompass the role of individual, social,
environmental, and policy variables are of interest now (see,
e.g., Hoehner et al. 2003; King et al. 2002; Saelens et al. 2003;
Sallis et al. 2004; Spencer and Blades 2006).


Risk and Modifying Factors

Individual level: child characteristics. Safe travel behavior
requires an adequate level of cognitive and behavioral skills
125


such as recognizing risks, comprehending possible actions,
making appropriate decisions, and taking related actions
(Thomson et al. 1996). Accordingly, age becomes an impor-
tant consideration in restrictions parents place on a child’s
travel activities (i.e., how far the child can go, whether he or
she can cross major roads, or ride a bicycle, etc.; Hillman,
Adams, and Whitelegg 1990). Parents, however, tend to
allow more independence to boys than girls of the same age,
which might partly explain a higher rate of pedestrian inju-
ries and fatalities among boys (see National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration 2006).
Yet, the influence of a child’s gender on travel to school

seems mixed. A few studies suggest that more boys than girls
walk or bike to school (Evenson et al. 2003; McMillan et al.
2006; Timperio et al. 2006). Other studies report no signifi-
cant gender differences in travel to school (McDonald 2005a;
Wen et al. 2008).

Household level: family characteristics. Along with financial
resources, availability of a household motor vehicle or the
number of drivers’ license holders seem to be positively cor-
related with auto trips to school (Bradshaw 1995; DiGuiseppi
et al. 1998; Ewing, Schroeer, and Greene 2004; Wen et al.
2008). In California, children from households with annual
income below $25,000 are nearly three times more likely to
walk or bike than those from households with annual income
above $75,000 (Surface Transportation Policy Project 2003).
In addition, studies suggest that parental or family sup-
port, especially maternal presence (Rosenbloom 1987;
Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008), parents’ attitudes toward
walking (Black, Collins, and Snell 2001; McMillan 2005),
their perceptions of neighborhood safety (Ahlport et al.
2008; DiGuiseppi et al. 1998; Ziviani, Scott, and Wadley
2004), and their own travel activities (McMillan et al. 2006),
are likely to determine how children travel to school and thus
their exposure to pedestrian injury risks.

Institutional level: school characteristics. Location of schools
and their accessibility is clearly the most notable barrier to
walking. Previous research has consistently found that dis-
tance (either actual or perceived) is most likely to influence
how children travel to and from school (e.g., Black, Collins,
and Snell 2001; Bradshaw 1995; Ewing, Schroeer, and
Greene 2004; Timperio et al. 2006). McDonald (2007) sug-
gests that increasing travel distance alone may account for
half of the decline in walking to school between 1969 and
2001 in the United States.
It is apparent that school travel is also influenced by con-
temporary education reform strategies to redress unequal
educational opportunities. Parents now have more choices in
selecting appropriate schools, often bypassing neighborhood
schools. For example, one study found that children who

attended nonneighborhood schools traveled 4.5 times more
miles and as to be expected, were six times less likely to walk
to school than those attending neighborhood schools (Wilson,

126


Wilson, and Krizek 2007). The trend suggests a gradual
denouement of Clarence Perry’s (1929) classic neighbor-
hood unit principles that, institutionalized by the American
Public Health Association (1948), became the basis for
school siting policy in the latter half of the last century.

Community level: neighborhood characteristics. The presence of
certain physical and social attributes in the neighborhood
may affect perception of safety, as suggested in the “broken
windows” syndrome (c.f., Wilson and Kelling 1982). Signs
of abuse and neglect in the built environment (i.e., graffiti,
litter, empty beer bottles, and boarded-up or abandoned
buildings or cars) and social incivilities (i.e., homelessness,
public drunkenness, gangs, drug-selling activities, tagging
graffiti) can be daunting, and thus limiting walking choices
and propensity (Day 2006; Loukaitou-Sideris 2006). Also,
obstructed views or limited visibility in the proximate envi-
ronment, limited surveillance or absence of the “eyes on the
street” (c.f., Jacobs 1961), and lack of familiarity can cause
apprehension and thus deter walking (Kaplan, Kaplan, and
Ryan 1998).
Various studies have identified the risk factors for child
pedestrian injuries. These include streets with high traffic
volumes, posted speeds and number of parked cars, and
absence of play areas (Agran et al. 1996; Appleyard 1981;
Roberts et al. 1995). Although many parents drive their chil-
dren to schools for safety reason, high traffic volume in the
vicinity of the school remains a threat (Collins and Kearns
2001). Absence or inadequate provision of pedestrian ameni-
ties such as sidewalks, crosswalks, and signalization can also
provoke a higher risk (Transportation Research Board 2002).
The literature suggests that the deterrents to walking to
school involve both the characteristics of the proximate built
environment and also certain traits of the social milieu that
define the neighborhood environment, as we have noted pre-
viously. Recent research on active living has produced a
number of built environment audit tools as recently reviewed
by Lewis (2010, 2011). But very little of that work provided
child-specific or elderly-specific audits: the two extremes of
age-contingent limits of competency (Uhm, Lewis, and

Banerjee 2011). The notion of “environmental press”—that
is, the degree to which the attributes of the environment can
impede or facilitate performance of activities for a given
level of competence—discussed by Lawton and Nahemow
(1973) suggests that the proximate environment needs to be
more user-friendly for population with developing or declin-
ing competencies. Our findings may contribute to develop-
ment of a new generation of audit system designed for
children and elderly.


Methodology
Five elementary schools located in the historic University of
Southern California’s University Park campus surrounding
area were recruited to participate in the study conducted in
Journal of Planning Education and Research 34(2)


the spring of 2007. Figure 1 presents the study schools and
their attendance boundaries.
Located in low-income minority communities, just a few
miles south of downtown Los Angeles, the study schools
enrolled predominantly Hispanic students, ranging from 77
percent of student body (Foshay) to 97 percent (Norwood)
(see Figure 2). Most students in three public schools were
receiving free or reduced-price meals. The service areas (i.e.,
school attendance boundaries) range from 0.55 to 1.09 square
mile and their population densities range from 24.15 to 42.86
per acre, much denser than that of the City of Los Angeles
(13.10 persons per acres). Land use is mainly residential
ranging from 78 to 91 percent of the total land areas, except
in the Norwood neighborhood, where it is more mixed. All
of the study schools, except Weemes, are located along high
traffic arterials or close to freeways.2
In consultation with the school principals, a total of six
fifth-grade classrooms from the five study schools were
selected, comprising 176 child–parent pairs eligible for the
study.3 Written informed parental consent and the assent of
the children had to be obtained according to the IRB protocol
and a total of 104 children (59 percent participation rate)
agreed to participate. As to be expected, close to 90 percent
of the participating children were of Hispanic origin, overall
comprising more girls (54 percent) than boys (46 percent).
Consenting parents agreed to complete and return a survey
questionnaire. Eighty-seven parents returned the surveys (49
percent response rate). Table 1 summarizes demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics of the children by schools.
At the individual level, written, verbal, and visual record-
ing methods provided different yet complementary informa-
tion about children’s insight into school travel and
neighborhood environment. The protocol included a range of
hands-on methods developed to elicit children’s perspectives
of “lived” experience (see Greene and Hogan 2005 for
review): their perception of the neighborhood, values and
preferences about their proximate environment, their chosen
routes, and experience of travel to and from school.


Child-Centered Activities

The study required three classrooms sessions over a three-
week period. In the first session all children in a classroom
received an introduction packet that included parent informed
consent form, child assent form, and parent questionnaire4
and child-friendly leaflets that explained the study and their
expected participation in different activities.
The second session began with collecting the signed con-
senting documents and completed parent questionnaires to
identify study participants. All children who agreed to par-
ticipate in the study with their parents’ consents received an
aerial photo of the school neighborhood with all the street
names clearly shown. Children were first asked to locate
their school and home on the map, and then to draw their
normal route(s) to and from school with a colored pen, using

arrows to indicate travel directions. A total of 143 school
travel routes (1.38 routes per child in average) were recorded,
irrespective of mode of travel. Children then were asked to
identify places that they liked, disliked, or felt unsafe on the
map to write brief comments explaining why. Children were

able to identify a total of 399 places (2.84 places per child in
average). Overall, places that children liked were most fre-
quently mentioned (67 percent), followed by disliked (24
percent) and unsafe places (9 percent), in respective order.
The project team5 later visited and photographed the places
mentioned by the children.
In the third and last session, the children first completed
a survey questionnaire inquiring (1) their current travel mode
to and from school; (2) experience of school journey (i.e.,
encountered barriers); (3) perceptions of environmental risk
on way to and from school; and (4) preference for travel
mode to and from school.6 A total of hundred questionnaires
were completed.7 Finally photos of the places previously
identified by children were presented to the children with
their locations marked on the map. An evaluation form com-
prising a safe–unsafe binary scale was distributed to the
127








children to evaluate the photos based on either their experi-
ences with the place or visual qualities of the scene, or both.



Built Environment Measures
Our audit of the built environment involved several mea-
sures: geographic information system database, hard-copy
maps, aerial photographs, and data collected from field vis-
its. The school service areas were first divided into 0.25- ×
0.25-mile grid cells (or forty acres) and urban form measures
were collected from the cells that contained children’s self-
reported school travel routes. In total, forty-three grid cells
were measured on four broad themes suggested to influence
walking: land use density and diversity, street pattern, pedes-
trian infrastructure, and traffic levels across the four school
neighborhoods. Of the attributes listed above, those with
areal measures, such as street area, were computed as a frac-
tion of each grid cell. Other attributes such as crime density
was converted to per-acre measures by dividing the number
of incidents in the grid square divided by its area. The inven-
tory also included streets with surveillance from Kid Watch

of selected pedestrian infrastructure and design elements
required field visits by the research team.

Findings
Mode of Travel
When asked about how they travel to school, 63 percent of
the children reported that they are driven to school either
alone or with other children. Approximately 32 percent of
the children indicated walking or biking to school most days.
As to be expected, a higher percentage of children walked or

biked (48 percent) coming home, while the car rides
decreased to 51 percent. This increased rate of walking home
suggests that working parents were unable to drive them
home midafternoon.

Travel Routes
The travel distance between home and school was measured
from the routes drawn by children on aerial-view maps.
Figure 3 summarizes the selected characteristics of the chil-
dren’s travel routes. Typically they walked or biked much
farther than a quarter mile, normally considered appropriate
walking distance for grade school children. On average,

children walked nearly 0.48 miles for the trip to school and
those who were driven traveled about 0.61 miles. For the trip
from school, children (including those driven to school one
way) walked a longer distance (0.54 miles).
The proportion of children walking or biking to school
decreased with increasing distance (especially when greater
than a half mile) (Table 2). Even of those who lived closer to
school, a significant proportion—43 percent living within a
quarter mile and more than 56 percent living within a quarter
to a half mile—were driven to school. This trend was true for
trips from school as well.


Route Choices
Interestingly, children who walked to or from school often
did not take the shortest route between home and school,
contrary to what previous studies presumed (e.g., Timperio
et al. 2006). Some routes were much longer than the short-
est route in network distance (0.45 mile). Possible reasons
are to avoid heavy traffic or unsafe area, to walk with
friends on the way to or from school, to experience interest-
ing walking environment, or simply distortions in their cog-
nitive maps.
Children’s travel routes were further subjected to an audit
of the proximate environment based on secondary data and
field observation. Table 3 summarizes objective characteris-
tics of the routes chosen, categorized by land use, street pat-
tern, traffic environments, pedestrian-friendly features,

aesthetic variables (appearance, that is) was significantly
associated with a child’s school travel choice to or from
school. For the trip to school, only percentage street area
(rpb = –.21) (lower the percentage, the less traffic volume)
and crime density (rpb = –.22) (the lower the density the
safer) were inversely correlated with active commuting to
school.9 For the trip from school, the number of Kid Watch
sites was positively associated with active commuting from
school (rpb = .21), whereas well-maintained sidewalks (i.e.,
absence of broken surfaces, pot holes, cracks, obstructions,
etc.) (rpb = –.21) and crime density (rpb = –.32) were
inversely associated with children walking or biking for
this trip. The negative association between sidewalk main-
tenance and walking from school is counterintuitive to a
general assumption that well-maintained sidewalk condi-
tions can create a more amenable pedestrian environment
with comfort and safety. We believe that this counterintui-
tive finding may simply reflect a paradox in children’s
route choice influenced by their preference for safer, but
busier, streets where sidewalks may be less well maintained
or in a constant state of maintenance—curb cuts, utility
connections, street hardware repair, etc.—and avoiding
quiet and empty residential streets with well-maintained
sidewalks.
The density of crime along the child’s travel route was the
only factor found to be significantly inversely associated
with both walking to and from school, consistent with the
concerns raised by the Kid Watch10 volunteers from focus
group discussion and survey. The issues related to gangs and
drug activities, particularly during school commuting hours,
were most frequently mentioned.

Perception of Safety

About 54 percent of the children perceived walking as safe,

while 41 percent of them responded otherwise. As expected,

children who perceived walking as safe were more likely to

walk to and/or from school (Table 4). However, the per-

ceived safety of walking was found significantly related only

to current mode to school, <U+03C7>2(1, n = 95) = 5.20, p < .05.

Especially, girls appeared to be more influenced by safety

perception in walking than did boys. When controlling for

gender, significantly more girls who perceived walking as

safe walked to school (56 vs. 23 percent) than those who

perceived unsafe, <U+03C7>2(1, n = 53) = 5.84, p < .05.

When asked what made walking to or from school unsafe,

the children most frequently selected “fast-moving cars,”

followed by “many strangers” and other such social dangers
(Table 5). Deficits in the built environment ranked relatively
low compared to the concerns about the proximate social
milieu. The rankings of perceived risk were very similar

between the two groups, r s (16) = .76, p < .01.

When asked what would make walking to school safer or

more appealing, appearance of the proximate environment

seemed to matter most for these children. Thus, “cleaner

street” was most frequently selected (over 69 percent) fol-

lowed by “no graffiti” and “less crime in my neighborhood”

(66 and 65 percent, respectively) (Table 6). Crossing the

street also ranked high, especially for the walkers who iden-

tified “safe places to cross the road” as the top concern.

Nevertheless, there was a high level of agreement between

the two groups of children regarding the rankings of per-

ceived positive attributes supportive of walking to school, rs

(21) = .80. p < .01.


Neighborhood Environment and Walkability

Place-mapping activities captured children’s positive, nega-
tive, or safety related apprehensions. Each child identified
approximately four places on average; a total of 177 different
places were identified along (but not limited to) children’s
travel routes. Places that children identified as liked, dis-
liked, or dangerous were classified into six categories: resi-
dential area or street (including freeway, travel route,
intersection, alley and underpass); shops or restaurants; park
131

or recreational facilities; nonrecreational community facili-
ties; home (including homes of friends or relatives); and
other (i.e., construction site, vacant lot, abandoned building,
parents’ workplace, etc.).

Places Liked

Children mentioned commercial establishments most often
as their favorite places (36 percent), including a variety of
stores and restaurants ranging from a small food market to a
large chain grocery store and a shopping center in the neigh-
borhood. This suggests that commercial establishments serve
as a cognitive anchor, more frequently selected than parks
and recreational facilities (14 percent) contrary to conven-

tional wisdom.

However, children’s affinity for these places was closely

related to the perceived conviviality and the public life of

these places, offering opportunities for various physical,

social, and commercial activities (70 percent), and safety (22

percent). Children enjoyed the presence of other people and

chance to “bump into” friends. Also these places seemed to

provide children with a sense of security with the familiarity

with places and people, reminiscent of Jane Jacobs’s obser-

vations of about “eyes on the street” in sidewalks fronting

various commercial activities and the random social con-

tact—the essence of public life. They also felt safe where

there was formal surveillance.


Places Children Disliked or Where Felt Unsafe

Residential areas/streets were consistently mentioned most

often as disliked (76 percent) or unsafe (74 percent) places,

followed by parks and recreational facilities (10 or 14 per-

cent, respectively). Why a place was disliked was associated

with safety issue (73 percent) and, to a lesser extent, with

sensory qualities such as noise, dirty street, and ugly houses

(22 percent). Table 7 summarizes the children’s risk percep-

tions categorized by the characteristics of places. Their

responses suggest that signs of social incivilities or social

dangers by far were of greater concern (86 percent) than per-

ceived traffic dangers (8 percent).

Gang-related activities dominated personal safety con-

cerns. Children were very much aware of places where gangs

frequently appeared or adorned with their territorial markers
like graffiti:

Unsafe because sometimes there’s gangsters drinking and
smoking and there is also tagging on the floor and the walls.

Children were very much aware of crime hot spots in the
neighborhood where violent crimes occurred or sometimes
they witnessed:

I don’t like Adams Street because there’s a lot of violence,
brutality, gangsters, drive-by, and murders.

I don’t like this place because there is gun shooting at night
and police cars.

I don’t like these places because I saw a dead body.

Often children were torn between opportunities some places
afforded and attendant safety concerns. They talked about
their daily struggles in some of the neighborhood parks

where their access and use was intimidated by the presence
of risk elements, ranging from dangerous objects to gang
activities:

[We] like because kids play (but) unsafe because many trash,
glass rocks, chips in sand.

I don’t feel safe on Toberman Park because there are a lot of
gangs.

They perceived streets as dangerous where fast-moving cars

often didn’t stop for pedestrians and the risk of being hit by
a car:

I dislike that place because the cars always go fast.

Sometimes cars don’t stop, and there might be an accident.

In their photo evaluation, safest places were all linked to their
social functions (i.e., school, church, library, grocery store, or
shopping mall). Freeway underpass and dark alleys were per-
ceived the least safe, along with the places with barking dogs.

possible to examine differences or similarities.


Acknowledgments
The authors would particularly like to acknowledge the support and
cooperation from the principals of Foshay, Norwood, St. Agnes,
Vermont, and Weems elementary schools and the classroom teach-
ers whose students participated in the study. We also acknowledge
the help from the USC Civic and Community Relations Office, and
the Kids Watch volunteers. Several graduate and undergraduate
students helped us in conducting this study, and here we recognize
them: Stephanie Kotin, Isidro Cerda, Regina Pritchett, and Sangmin
Kim. Finally, we acknowledge constructive criticisms from our
anonymous reviewers whose comments had helped us refine the
final narrative.

Funding

The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support

for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This

research was supported by the METRANS Transportation Center,

University of Southern California, under grants from the U.S.

Department of Transportation and the California Department of

Transportation. All views expressed are those of the authors.


Notes
1. According to a recent report, 70 percent of the funding in
California has been awarded for infrastructure projects (see
Hubsmith 2007).
2. The service area does not apply to St. Agnes, a parish school.
Students come from a larger service area than that of Vermont
School located next door.
3. The study requested multiple class visits, which made up about
2.5 hours of in-class activities. Thus, the recruitment of class-
rooms was largely dependent on the willingness of classroom
teachers and class schedules. The Vermont School was most
willing, in which two classes volunteered to participate.
4. Materials for parents were written in English and then later
translated into Spanish. Parents received both versions.
5. Initially, the methodology was developed to distribute a
disposable camera to each child so children can document
their environments en route to and from school. However,
it was rejected by the University of Southern California
(USC) institutional review board on the ground that it might
endanger children (i.e., possibility of causing unnecessary
distractions and being exposed to social and traffic dangers,
etc.).
6. Questions included items comparable to those from the parent
survey questionnaire in order to examine congruence in the
responses of the children and their parents.

7. For the activities in the third session, the study missed four
children. They were either absent on the day of the session or
in a different classroom for other lessons.
8. A program initiated by USC and its Family of Schools.
Dwellings of residents volunteering for this program are

marked with a special decal, and the children can approach

those residents if they perceive any threats.
9. The point–biserial correlation coefficient (rpb) provides a cor-
relation measure of the strength and direction of relationship
between a dichotomous variable (walking to/from school or
not walking to/from school in this case) and a nondichotomous
variable.
10. A neighborhood-based program where residents volunteer to
keep an eye on children walking to and from school.
