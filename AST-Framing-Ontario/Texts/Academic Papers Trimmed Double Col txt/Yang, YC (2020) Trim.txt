Abstract
This study analyzes the association between exposure to various economic establishments, such as retail stores and schools,
and walking and cycling at the individual level. Instead of using a land use mix indicator applied in many previous studies, 17
types of establishments were investigated, based on the North American Industrial Classification System, located within indi-
viduals’ activity spaces. The 2017 Wisconsin Add-On to the National Household Travel Survey was used to compute the den-
sity of establishments for two different activity space measurements: (1) time-weighted one standard deviational ellipses, and
(2) convex hulls. Among the significant results agreed on by both activity space measurements, walking and cycling are posi-
tively associated with exposure to educational services and public administration establishments, and negatively associated
with exposure to finance and insurance establishments. The results indicate a possible strategy: active travel promotion could
leverage the potential for schools and local government offices to serve as anchor institutions for health-promoting travel
behavior. In addition to strategies for the built environment, the research also suggests that physical activity encouragement
could target individuals, such as workers, who probably have exposure to establishments with a negative association with
active travel, such as in the finance and insurance sector.

walking and cycling for a representative sample for the
state of Wisconsin in the United States. Moreover,
the analysis aligns individual-level exposures and
individual-level outcomes instead of relying on aggre-
gated measurements. The results can be useful to com-
munities developing land use, transportation, and health
policies to increase active transportation.

Literature and Background

Representing Specific Establishments in the Built
Environment
The broader question guiding this research asks which
features of built environments influence active travel
behavior. Cervero and Kockelman distilled these features
into indicators representing an area’s activity density,
land use diversity, and design (3Ds) (16). Recent studies
have generally confirmed that places with higher residen-
tial and employment density, smaller block size, con-
nected street patterns, pedestrian and bicycle
infrastructure and amenities, and a higher degree of land
use mix are associated with less driving and more walk-
ing and cycling (17–21). However, Frank and Engelke
pointed out that built environment variables usually cov-
ary or correlate across space (6). It is difficult to deter-
mine precisely which features matter most.
Many studies find that land use mix is an important
determinant of walkability, and entropy-based indices
have been the most popular indicator of land use mix (22–
25). These studies usually categorize land use as residential,
commercial, recreational, office, and educational. Cao
et al., using information from an online yellow pages,
accounted for the location of institutional, maintenance,
dining, and leisure destinations (26). Nonetheless, commer-
cial establishments were aggregated into one accessibility
variable for a causal model. By simply looking at the
degree of mix or accessibility to amenities, it is still unclear
which specific types of neighborhood amenities, specifi-
cally economic establishments, are most critical to active
travel behavior, particularly across urban, suburban, and
rural places with different land use patterns.

The relevance of specific establishments is an impor-
tant concern in research about the association between

built environment and public health. Kestens et al.

accounted for exposure to different types of food stores

in research about the risk of being overweight (27). They

found that the risk of being overweight increases with

exposure to fast food restaurants. However, there is

more to understand about the interrelationships between

specific land use types and active travel behavior.


Representing Exposure to Built Environments
Most studies of active travel and built environments rely
on two types of aggregated data: 1) representing places
Transportation Research Record 2674(4)


by their neighborhood boundaries, census tracts, block
groups, ZIP codes, or traffic analysis zones; and 2) repre-
senting populations by their aggregate travel outcomes
(17, 21, 28, 29). In this analysis, the concept of the activ-
ity space is used as the unit of analysis, which allows us
to link individual-level travel outcomes with individual-
level exposures, thereby making a closer connection
between the exposure and the outcome.
Activity spaces are the geographical areas that people
visit during the course of their daily activities (30, 31).
Activity spaces have been used to represent exposure,
usually as an alternative to residential neighborhood.
With respect to transportation systems, activity spaces
include areas near the home and place of work, as well
as journeys to school, church, medical appointments,
shopping, social occasions, and other activities through
which people have direct contact with their environ-
ments. Activity spaces have both spatial and temporal
components. Several socioeconomic and demographic
factors influence the size and nature of individuals’ activ-
ity spaces, such as age, gender, labor force participation,
access to a private automobile, household size, house-
hold income, and education (32, 33).
Activity spaces help overcome prior methodological
limitations of similar analyses. For example, Howell
et al. (34) used a survey of Canadian college students to
show that the built environment and transportation-
related physical activity relationship cannot be ade-
quately assessed by using only individuals’ residential
environments, as people may spend much of their time
outside home-based activity spaces. Instead of analyzing
the home-based activity spaces, Gunn et al. examined
metrics for built environment features surrounding local
shopping centers anchored by supermarkets, and derived
policy implications for supermarket provision (20).
However, no previous studies have examined how built
environment features within personal activity space
influence active travel among populations in general.



Data and Methods
Travel Data

This study uses the Wisconsin Add-On to the 2017

National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) to construct

activity spaces for individuals, represent individual and

household characteristics, and indicate levels of physical

activity (35). In the travel survey, Wisconsin households

were selected from 16 substrata representing the entire

state. The daily travel data include an inventory of all

trips taken within a 24-h period by all household mem-
bers aged 5 or older. This data set includes 84,544 trips
for 19,941 persons in 10,723 households. The confiden-
tial data also include geocoded location information for
57,040 homes, workplaces, schools, and other travel

destinations. The activity space construction for this
study was based on these geocoded locations.


Activity Spaces Measures
Several different activity space measurements have been
applied to study health and travel behavior, including
perceived or officially defined neighborhoods, convex
hulls (CHs), route buffers, kernel density surfaces, and
standard deviational ellipses (SDEs). The measures have
unique advantages and drawbacks with respect to data
availability and measurement accuracy. They have been
constructed using travel diaries, global positioning sys-
tem tracking, social media data mining, or web-based
questionnaires (36–41).
Two measures were used to represent activity spaces:
time-weighted one SDEs and CHs. These two represen-
tations accommodate the NHTS data, which provide a
finite set of point locations but no line features to repre-
sent route choice. Because of this data limitation, as well
as the large scope of the study area, questions that
required detailed route trajectories were not pursued.
The time-weighted SDE and CH measures generally
result in an activity space larger than observed route-
based activity spaces (42). Nevertheless, these larger

areas capture places that an individual might not have
interacted with but would potentially encounter when
carrying out everyday activities.
The duration of activity space data collection also
affects the measurement’s reliability. Studies of this issue
show that at least 14 days of travel activity observation
are desirable for identifying activity space accurately (39,
43). However, obtaining 14 days of GPS data is not
always feasible. Using only 1 day of travel activity for
each person is also considered valid when the travel sur-
vey data set is sufficiently large, such as for the
Wisconsin Add-On to the NHTS (27).
Based on the geocoded locations in the travel survey,
10,362 valid SDEs and 19,941 CHs for individuals who
traveled on the day of the travel survey were constructed.
For SDEs, a one SDE was generated for each individual
and weighted based on the individual’s duration at each
location, which is information available from the travel
diary (see Figure 1). Because creating an ellipse requires
at least three distinct point features with variation in both
the X and Y axes, 9,579 out of 19,941 cases had too few
features or too few vertices to create a valid geometry
and were excluded from this step. Among these 9,579
excluded cases, 7,819 contained only two points, which
indicates that the person had only been at two places on




individual’s travel survey day.

the travel day. The other 1,760 cases contained missing
values for duration, which were time-weighted as zeros,
resulting in missing vertices.
A CH is the minimum convex polygon enclosing the
set of destinations of an individual on a Euclidean space.
All 19,941 people generated a valid CH based on the
ArcGIS minimum bounding geometry tool. If only two
points were available, a line feature was generated.
The data set was further refined by selecting cases in
which the activity space was located completely within
Wisconsin, which resulted in 7,539 SDEs and 15,640
CHs.

Business Types and Economic Exposure

In this study, ‘‘economic exposure’’ is defined as an indi-
vidual’s exposure to different types of businesses in the
built environment. The North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) codes were used, avail-
able from the 2015 Environmental Systems Research
Institute (Esri) Business Analyst, to identify and classify
geocoded business locations (44).
NAICS is an industry classification system that groups
establishments into industries based on the similarity of
their production processes. The system includes 20 sec-
tors represented by two-digit NAICS codes covering all
economic activities (45). For 2015, there were 252,253
economic activities located within the state of Wisconsin;
91.7% of these were located within the sampled personal
activity spaces measured by time-weighted SDEs, and
91.5% were located within the sampled personal activity
space measured by CHs.
For this analysis, the top 17 categories that are most
frequent and relevant to individuals’ daily activities were
selected and the remaining three that were not informa-
tive for the research objective were excluded. The num-
ber of establishments for the three excluded categories
account for only 0.4% of the total establishments in both

activity space measurements.

For each traveler in the Wisconsin Add-On to the
2017 NHTS, the density of economic exposure was com-
puted as the count of economic locations within the indi-
vidual’s activity space divided by the size of the
individual’s activity space in square miles. In general, the
density of economic exposure in activity spaces measured
by CHs has a larger variance than that measured by
time-weighted SDEs.


Active Travel Behavior and Person Characteristics
All travel behavior and sociodemographic variables were
derived from the NHTS data set. The outcome
variable—active travel behavior—is defined as the
self-reported number of walking plus cycling trips for all
Transportation Research Record 2674(4)


purposes in the past 7 days for an individual, ranging
from 0 to 149 with a mean of 6.0 and standard deviation
of 8.7. These walk or bike trips include all purposes of
walking or bicycling outside, including walking or bicy-
cling to exercise, to a friend’s house, around the neigh-
borhood, to the store, and walking the dog; 44% of the
unweighted self-reported walk or bike trips were strictly
to exercise, according to the raw data.
Self-selection has been a key consideration in previous
research (26, 34, 46). For example, a physically active
person may choose to be exposed to certain economic
establishments and a walkable built environment to sat-
isfy their preferences for physical activity. Therefore, an
individual’s personal characteristics are assumed to affect
both their exposure to economic locations and the active
travel behavior. To control for the self-selection effect,
age, sex, self-reported baseline level of physical activity,
and household income were included as confounders.
In addition, two urban form characteristics were con-
trolled for, beyond the business counts: intersection den-
sity and proximity to transit stops, measured at the
activity space level for each individual. These two vari-
ables may affect both the location of different establish-
ments and individuals’ active travel behavior. Spatial data
were extracted from the National Walkability Index (47).
Among the 7,539 SDE observations, eight had missing
physical activity level data, 16 had missing self-reported
walking in the past week, one had missing self-reported
cycling in the past week, and 189 had missing household
income information. Excluding these 214 missing values
resulted in 7,325 observations for the SDE measurement.
To make the two activity space measurements more com-
parable, the cases of CHs to SDEs were further matched,
which resulted in 6,286 observations for both measure-
ments. Therefore, the final data analysis was based on
these 6,286 individuals. The average activity space size
was 28.1 mi2 measured by SDEs, and 36.6 mi2 measured

by CHs. Table 1 presents the definitions of all variables

and descriptive statistics.


Model Specification

Table 1 shows that the outcome variable—the count of
the self-reported walking and cycling trips in the past
week—has a larger variance than mean, which indicates
an overdispersion of the outcome variable. An overdis-
persion value of 11.06 for SDEs and 11.02 for CHs from
an overdispersion test indicates that a negative binomial
regression is preferred (48). The model specification is
the following:

assess multicollinearity. VIFs are less than 2.4 and 2.7
for all predictors in SDE and CH measurements, respec-
tively. This suggests low multicollinearity for both activ-
ity space measurements. If 0 does not fall in the 95%
confidence interval for an estimate, this estimate is statis-
tically significant at the 95% confidence level.
Both SDE and CH activity space measurements agree
that exposure to educational services and public adminis-
tration have a statistically significant positive association
with the active travel behavior of walking and bicycling.
Both measurements report a statistically significant nega-
tive association with exposure to finance and insurance.
The CH measurement agrees with the SDE measurement
for 13 out of 17 exposure variables with reference to the
direction of effects. The other four sectors that failed to
reach agreement are retail trade, other personal services,
accommodation and food services, and wholesale trade.
For the SDE measurement alone, exposure to trans-
portation and warehousing, as well as to information
services, has significant negative effects on active travel
behavior at the 95% confidence level. The additional
exposures that had positive effects on active travel at the
95% confidence level for the CH measurement alone
include professional, scientific, and technical services,
and real estate. Exposure to waste management estab-
lishments in the CH had a significantly negative effect on
active travel at the 95% confidence level.
Interpreting the negative binomial regression model
results is not intuitive because the regression coefficients
are the log count values of exposure. By exponentiating
regression coefficients the incidence rate ratio is
obtained—the change factor in active travel behavior in
response to a one count per square mile change of expo-
sure variable values. For example, the expected walking
or bicycling trips within a week changes by a factor of
expð0:0116Þ = 1:0117, which is a 1.17% increase, in
response to an additional educational service establish-
ment per square mile in an individual’s activity space for
the SDE measurement, holding other factors constant.
The active travel behavior of walking plus bicycling has
a mean of six times a week. On average, to increase the
amount of active travel from six to seven times a week
for an individual, exposure needs to be increased by
lnð7=6Þ=lnð1:0117Þ = 13:25 more educational services
per square mile in the individual’s activity space.
To interpret the effect of finance and insurance for the
CH measurement, the expected walking or bicycling trips
in a week change by a factor of expð0:0054Þ = 0:9946,
which is a decrease of 0.54%, in response to an addi-
tional finance and insurance establishment per square
mile in an individual’s activity space, holding other fac-
tors constant. On average, increasing walking or bicy-
cling trips in a week from six to seven times would
require the expected density of finance and insurance

Figure 2 visualizes the effects of all statistically signifi-
cant exposures on active travel measured by both SDEs
and CHs.


Person and Urban Form Characteristics
Both SDE and CH activity space measurements report
statistically significant results for several sociodemo-
graphic and physical activity level variables. When other
factors are held constant, females walk or bike less than
males, on average. Moreover, reporting a higher baseline
level physical activity is significantly related to more
active travel behavior.
Proximity to transit does not significantly associate
with active travel. Intersection density within individuals’
activity spaces is significantly negatively related to active
travel for the SDE measurement. These results are coun-
terintuitive because places with higher intersection den-
sity and more transit stops are considered more
walkable, at least for urban environments. However, this
is to some extent consistent with Joens-Matre et al. who
have found that urban children are the least active over-
all (49). In addition, Fan et al. have suggested that physi-
cal activity did not vary unidirectionally with degree of
urbanization (50). These findings also suggest that mea-
suring travel physical activity at the individual level can
yield different results from measuring it at the neighbor-
hood level (34).
Higher income is associated with less active travel
behavior. This may be because people with higher
incomes tend to participate in more structured leisure
time physical activities such as in the gym or parks,
whereas people with lower income may tend to walk,
bike, or use public transit in their daily travel.


Educational Services, Finance and Insurance, and
Public Administration
A closer look was taken of the spatial patterns of the
three types of economic establishments with significant
effects agreed on by both activity space measurements:
educational services, public administration, and finance
and insurance. Figure 3 presents the densities of these
three sectors on a 5- 3 5-mi grid for Wisconsin. It was
observed that the establishments cluster in urban areas,
mainly Milwaukee, Madison, Wausau, Appleton, Green
Bay, and Eau Claire. Table 3 presents information about
subgroups within the three sectors, categorized by their
four-digit NAICS code. Elementary and secondary
schools account for most educational services establish-
ments (60.1%). Public administration establishments are
mainly executive, legislative, and other general govern-
ment support activities, which account for 58.2% of

branch banks.


Discussion

lower exposure to finance and insurance establishments.
These establishment types may be closely related to
walkability. Most educational services in the analysis are
elementary and secondary schools. The walkability of
areas around them could be high if schools are located
within residential neighborhoods, and they may have
been enhanced by programs such as the Safe Routes to
School, which encourages children from kindergarten to
eighth grade to walk and bike to school. The presence of

Explanations for the other two significant factors
agreed on by both activity space measurements are less
intuitive than educational services. Establishments in the
public administration sector are mainly local government
offices, which can be clustered in central urban areas
with relatively more walkable environments. Finance
and insurance establishments mainly include branches of
banks and credit unions. As a result of the deregulation
and geographic liberalization of banking services since
the 1980s, locations of financial services are based on
demography, local trade areas, and market conditions
(51, 52). Access to banking services may be more auto-
mobile dependent in the suburbs, small towns, and rural
areas because of low population density.
Several other exposures were identified as significant
by either the SDE or the CH measurement but not both.
These other exposures that potentially positively influ-
ence active travel include professional, scientific, and
technical services (CHs) and real estate (CHs). Other
exposures that are potentially negatively associated with
active travel include transportation and warehousing
(SDEs), information (SDEs), and waste management
(CHs). This can be explained by their relevance to peo-
ple’s everyday activities. For instance, transportation
and warehousing and waste management establishments
are highly specialized, often located in peripheral areas
with access to freeways, and are mainly accessed by
workers. This also implies that workers at these locations
have inferior conditions for walking or cycling to their
workplaces. Therefore, public health professionals may
consider giving higher priority to developing physical
activity opportunities around these workplaces.
The effects of the remaining exposures are unclear.
Noticeably, retail trade establishments are the most pre-
valent establishment type in the study and they are
closely related to the activities of daily life. However,
both activity space measurements found a very small and
insignificant association between retail trade exposure
and active travel. This may be because many retail trade
establishments are located within big-box stores or strip
malls, not walkable main streets. Some previous research
has assumed that retail stores are positively related to
walkability, or have even used the proximity to retail
stores as an indicator of walkability (25, 53–55).
Although this might be true at the neighborhood level,
particularly in dense urban areas, this current study does
not support this assumption at the population level.
Planners and policy makers need to instead consider
improving walkability around retail establishments that
are not always pedestrian or bicycle friendly.
It is not realistic to build more schools or government
offices solely for the purpose of promoting more walking
or bicycling trips. Nevertheless, schools, government
buildings, and other ‘‘anchor institutions’’ can influence
Transportation Research Record 2674(4)


larger populations, not just their users. The built envir-
onments around these anchor institutions could be prior-
itized when making decisions about investment in
pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, green infrastruc-
ture, and transit station area design, for example.


Limitations
Although no previous studies have examined the eco-
nomic exposure and active travel using the activity space
as the unit of analysis, several limitations of this study
should be noted. First, this study did not identify certain
colocation effects among establishments to reflect the
effect of land use mix. Land use mix, however, has a
complicated relationship with travel behavior. In a
metaregression analysis, Stevens found that people actu-
ally drive more when land use mix increases (11). We
have tested this effect by introducing interaction terms
among economic categories and the result was not signif-
icant in general. Because of the scope of this study, the
result was not presented. Second, active travel behavior
was measured by the frequency of walking and cycling,
rather than total minutes of walking and cycling, which
could capture the intensity of active travel more pre-
cisely. Third, the categorization of economic establish-
ment was based on the two-digit NAICS code. This is a
fairly rough classification. More detailed examinations
of economic establishments within specific industrial
types could be more revealing. Fourth, the density of
economic exposure variables used in this study only indi-
cates the proximity of these exposures for individuals,
rather than their actual accessibility. The accessibility of
these economic establishments may be determined by
microscale built environment features such as pedestrian
paths, bike lanes, street furniture, and other elements
and their combination. How these microscale built envi-
ronment features mediate the accessibility to economic
establishments could be an area for future research.


Conclusion
This study uses the activity space as the spatial unit of
analysis to examine the types of economic establishments
that individuals would potentially encounter in their
daily activities beyond their residential neighborhoods.
Exposures to economic establishments were systemati-
cally quantified and they represent a wider range of land
use types beyond residential, commercial, recreational,
office, and educational, which have been analyzed in pre-
vious studies (23–25). The analysis identified schools and
public buildings as anchor institutions that merit urban
design attention because of their positive relationship to
active transportation at the population level.
Communities may take advantage of educational services

to develop more pedestrian-oriented infrastructures or
introduce more health-promoting programs to the sur-
rounding communities.
This study has challenged the conventional assump-
tion found in previous research that retail stores are a

positive feature in promoting active travel. This assump-
tion may hold when focusing on a neighborhood, corri-
dor, or zone within a metropolitan area. However, in
this study of an entire state, we did not find evidence of
a relationship between retail stores and active travel.
Consequently, we see designing walkable retail environ-
ments as an ongoing concern for research and commu-
nity development.
Public health professionals have the expertise to pro-
vide health promotion recommendations that target

individual-level behavior change, such as suggesting indi-

vidual physical activity plans. One implication of this
research for health experts is that their work may want to
focus on people who are known to have exposure to less
walkable economic establishments, such as finance and
insurance, transportation and warehousing, information
services, and waste management services. Specifically,
more physical activity opportunities may need to be pro-
vided to employees of these workplaces.
