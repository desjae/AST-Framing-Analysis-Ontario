Keywords:                                                    School trips have distinct characteristics compared with trips for other purposes (e.g., work and recreation).
School trip                                                  School trips have been extensively studied in North American and western European countries. However, these

indicated that the absence of a public transit system and the lack of good-quality school bus services resulted

to model the travel mode choice decisions of school children; distance
and sidewalk coverage were identi<U+FB01>ed as signi<U+FB01>cant factors a<U+FB00>ecting
travel mode choice. McMillan (2005) proposed a systematic framework
for understanding the mechanisms in<U+FB02>uencing school travel; it sug-
gested that although distance predominantly in<U+FB02>uenced the mode of
travel, decisions were also moderated by attitudinal, cultural, and so-
ciodemographic factors.
Age and gender of the children are the two sociodemographic at-
tributes typically included in travel mode choice studies. Although most
studies have shown increase in the tendencies of walking and biking
among students with increase in age (McDonald, 2008a, 2008b; Noland
et al., 2014; Sidharthan et al., 2011), some have found an inverse
(McMillan et al., 2006) or no association between age and travel mode
choice (Wilson et al., 2010); However, these results may have depended
on the selection of age groups for the survey. Regarding gender, boys
are generally more likely to ride a bicycle than are girls in the same age
group (Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014; Emond and Handy, 2012;
McDonald, 2007; McMillan et al., 2006; Samimi and Ermagun, 2013a;
Sidharthan et al., 2011). A study by Scheiner (2016) found that es-
corting behavior of parents to their kids in the age group of 6 to
13 years were dependent on the gender of children and positively in-
<U+FB02>uenced their income. Girls had higher probability of being accom-
panied by parents than boys. By contrast, some studies have reported no
association between gender and travel mode (Wilson et al., 2010).
Household-level factors have also been included in some school travel
studies. Low household income can increase the likelihood of children
commuting actively to school (Ewing et al., 2004; McMillan, 2007;
Samimi and Ermagun, 2013b; Sidharthan et al., 2011; Wilson et al.,
2010). Flexible work pattern of parents, particularly that of fathers, can
increase the chances of children being accompanied by their parents in
the active transport modes (McDonald, 2008b; Seraj et al., 2012;
Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008). A larger size of household can likely
increase the chances of children being accompanied to school (in-
cluding being dropped o<U+FB00> in personal vehicles) (Li and Zhao, 2015).
Furthermore, the presence of siblings attending the same school can
also have a positive association with walking and biking; however, the
results related to this sibling e<U+FB00>ect remain mixed (McMillan, 2005).
The distance between the school and house (and therefore, the
travel time) has consistently been shown to be associated with travel
mode choice (Mitra, 2012). Studies have also shown that perceived and
actual distances have di<U+FB00>erent magnitudes of e<U+FB00>ects on travel mode
choice (Emond and Handy, 2012). Some important built environment
attributes include presence and quality of transportation infrastructure,
such as sidewalk and pedestrian crossing. The e<U+FB00>ects of variables re-
lated to land use and urban form have been investigated in detail by
Noland et al. (2014). By using a mixed logit approach, the authors
found that a residential density exceeding a certain threshold motivated
active commute; in particular, smaller block sizes encouraged walking.
The household density of neighborhood around schoolchildren's homes
has a strong positive association with active travel (Kerr et al., 2006). In
addition, a higher tra<U+FB03>c density is negatively correlated with the odds
of walking (Kaplan et al., 2016; Su et al., 2013). However, because of
the di<U+FB00>erential e<U+FB00>ects of built environment factors, cycling and walking
as travel modes maybe di<U+FB00>erentiated for school travel (Kaplan et al.,
2016).
Many studies have assumed that parents essentially make decisions
on behalf of their children regarding travel mode choice and accom-
pany them to school (Lang et al., 2011; McMillan, 2007; Yarlagadda
and Srinivasan, 2008). Furthermore, a few studies have shown that
children above a certain age take independent decisions on their school
trips (Zwerts et al., 2010). School trip behavior is moderated by par-
ental perceptions about safety. Built environment factors, including
intersection type and presence and quality of sidewalk, in<U+FB02>uence travel
mode choice for school trips (Curtis et al., 2015; Macgregor, 2013).
Some studies have concluded that fear of crime, heavy tra<U+FB03>c, and car
ownership are signi<U+FB01>cant determinants of parental perception of active

travel modes for school trips (Schlossberg et al., 2006).Concerns re-
garding safety are negatively associated with active commute in many
studies (Elias and Katoshevski-Cavari, 2014; McMillan, 2007; Panter
et al., 2008). In addition to such moderation, literature associating
travel behavior of adults with that of children suggests that the school
travel decisions are household-level decisions (Ewing et al., 2004;
McDonald, 2008a) and therefore must be conceptualized in that
manner.
The aforementioned studies have reported several contradicting
<U+FB01>ndings, probably because of the di<U+FB00>erences in culture and methods
adopted for data collection (Pont et al., 2009). A study indicated no-
table variations in the correlation of active commute among children
across the eight countries of di<U+FB00>erent contexts, cultures, and geo-
graphies (Larouche et al., 2015). The context was distinctive feature in
a study on German students, where weather and school pro<U+FB01>le were
found to signi<U+FB01>cantly a<U+FB00>ect the choices (Müller et al., 2008). In New
Zealand study, road safety concerns and social norms were the domi-
nant factors found by an analysis of school travel (Lang et al., 2011).
Some works have explored these associations in non-Western so-
cieties. A study conducted in Tehran, Iran, showed that shorter distance
to school did not necessarily lead to walking and bicycling and that the
decisions were signi<U+FB01>cantly moderated by tra<U+FB03>c safety concerns and
perceptions (Shokoohi et al., 2012). Another study in Iran found that
perceived walking time to school was the most signi<U+FB01>cant barrier for
active travel to school while the other variables considered were related
to household characteristics, attitude and safety (Mehdizadeh et al.,
2017). A study on active commuting to school in Bogota, Colombia,
concluded that higher levels of educational achievement by parents
were associated with higher odds of bicycling (Leblanc et al., 2015). A
study in Ecuador identi<U+FB01>ed tra<U+FB03>c volume, tra<U+FB03>c speed, crime and
distance as parental perception barriers to active commuting (Huertas-
Delgado et al., 2017). The institutional and cultural context unique to
Beijing was found to be a signi<U+FB01>cant determinant of modal split (Li and
Zhao, 2015). A study on the built environment in Taipei found that
unlike the trends in Western societies, travel mode choices for school
trips in Taipei were not signi<U+FB01>cantly related to the employment status
of the mother and household income (Lin and Chang, 2010). In a recent
study, one-sixth students reported experiencing a road tra<U+FB03>c injury
during school journeys in Hyderabad, and school bus and bicycle were
respectively the safest and the least safe modes (Tetali et al., 2016).
In summary, literature on school trips in developing countries is
limited. However, a wide range of factors, including distance to school,
children's age and gender, parents' employment status and income, and
personal automobile ownership, are some of the important decision
variables for school trips. In addition, studies linking children's own
perceptions and attitudes with the travel mode choices remain scant.
Thus, the operant study attempted to <U+FB01>ll in the identi<U+FB01>ed research gaps.

4. Study area

Kanpur is an industrial city, with a population of > 2.7 million and
is the twelfth largest city among all 497 cities in India (Census of India,
2012). The city has a geographical area of 266.7 km2, with a population
density of > 10,000 people per km2. Of the total population, nearly 0.7
million children are aged 5–15 years, which can be considered the
school-going age. The considerably high proportion (24.4%) of children
and adolescents in Kanpur is consistent with the national average.
Transport infrastructure in Kanpur has chronic problems, including a
lack of maintenance of local and arterial roads and absence of good-
quality public transport and even the basic tra<U+FB03>c management systems
(e.g., tra<U+FB03>c signals).

5. Data collection: sampling and survey design

Nine high schools were selected through random strati<U+FB01>ed sampling
to obtain a su<U+FB03>cient representative sample of a school population. In

284

brief, the 112 municipal wards in Kanpur were demarcated into eight
zones of a nearly equal geographical area by clubbing neighborhood
wards together. These zones were further strati<U+FB01>ed according to po-
pulation density and then according to school density (number of
schools per unit area). Finally, the selected schools were distributed
across the city spatially and were located in regions with representative
population densities and economic activities.
To collect the data on travel behavior, this study opted for self-ad-
ministered (drop-o<U+FB00> type) questionnaire survey, a method which has
been prominently used in travel mode choice studies worldwide. The
survey form was aimed to collect information on attitudinal and per-
sonal factors pertaining to school trips. In addition, e<U+FB00>orts were made
to collect data related to other important factors, such as distance be-
tween their school and home and route characteristics. Basic data re-
quirement and other relevant information were initially drawn from
literature and later modi<U+FB01>ed to adapt to the Indian scenario.
Information on the travel modes of home-to-school and school-to-home
trips was also included. Personal information (e.g., age, gender, and
home locality), household information (e.g., number of family mem-
bers, parents' employment status, monthly household income, and ve-
hicle ownership), and attitudinal information (e.g., perception about
motor vehicles and active commuting) were included in the ques-
tionnaire. Because schoolchildren could not estimate their travel times
correctly (Murakami and Wagner, 1999; Tetali et al., 2015), these were
estimated by using locations of major landmarks in the vicinity of their
homes. The names of landmarks reported by parents were geo-coded to
estimate distance and travel time from and to their schools. Prevailing
protocols to collect data from human subjects were followed.
The questionnaire comprised two parts. The <U+FB01>rst part was to be
<U+FB01>lled by the students and the other by their parents. Considering that
the study area contains predominantly Hindi-speaking population, the
survey form was bilingual (English and Hindi). Parallel translation by
multiple translators, a standard methodology to translate survey forms,
was followed. A pilot study was conducted with a smaller focus group of
schoolchildren, which facilitated several improvements in the survey
instrument. Accordingly, the survey questionnaire was revised before
conducting main data collection. The students were handed out the
questionnaires in schools, and all the questions were explained to them
in detail. An additional round of doubt-clearance discussion was orga-
nized at each school. The students responded to the questions about
travel mode choice, travel time, route characteristics, and cognitive and
attitudinal aspects, whereas the parents <U+FB01>lled the information about
student's age and gender as well as selected household-related char-
acteristics, including income, size, and vehicle ownership. A set of
questions related to the reasons for opting or not opting school buses
and perception about the service provided were responded by the stu-
dents in consultation with their parents. The survey forms were col-
lected with the assistance of the school administration over a period of
one week. The details of the schools were obtained through a school
information form, <U+FB01>lled by the interviewer in consultation with the
school administration. Data on zone level variables for household and
school zones were extracted from Census of India (2012).

6. Descriptive analysis

Nearly 2100 questionnaire survey forms were distributed in the
selected schools; of these, 1238 were returned, yielding a net response
rate of 35.9%. The response rates across the schools were in the range of
16% to 51%. After a quality check, 1096 responses were deemed sui-
table for analysis. The response rate was higher than the typical 20% to
25% reported for self-administered questionnaire surveys. Because the
questionnaires were handed over to the students in their classrooms,
the students and their parents might have perceived the survey as an
important task, similar to homework assignments. This could be the
reason for higher than usual response rate. Table 1 presents a de-
scriptive summary of the sample characteristics.

No signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erence was noted between journey “to school” and
return trip “to home.” Fig. 1 illustrates that although bicycle was the
travel mode chosen by boys, most girls were dropped o<U+FB00> in family
vehicles. Fig. 2 provides a visual presentation of the modal share with
respect to household income categories. Notably, walking and bicycling
were the major modes for the low-income groups, whereas cycle rick-
shaws and tempos were almost never preferred by the high-income
groups. Fig. 3 displays the distance traveled and travel time for school
trips. On the basis of the collected data, the median distance was the
highest for school bus and family vehicle (approximately 7 km). Among
all modes, time to travel was the longest in school buses, with a median
travel time of nearly 30 min. In addition, trips in school buses showed
more variation in distance traveled compared with other available
modes. Nonmotorized modes (walking, bicycling, and cycle-rickshaw)
were largely used for short distances. In northern India, tempo, a mo-
torized three-wheeler, is a popular mode of informal paratransit. Al-
though tempos have a capacity of six passengers, typically they carry
over 10 passengers and hence do not o<U+FB00>er comfortable travel for its
passengers. Yet, according to the survey, tempo has signi<U+FB01>cant modal
share in school trips. Approximately 37% of the students were un-
accompanied in their school trips. The most common companion in
school trips were siblings or peers, whereas approximately one-third of
the accompanied students traveled with either of their parents.
To understand the cognitive aspect of school trips, the questionnaire
included queries to grade respondents' opinions regarding four state-
ments related to culture, safety, speed, and peer e<U+FB00>ect. The cultural
e<U+FB00>ect was assumed to re<U+FB02>ect their perception about motor vehicles
being considered status symbols augmenting the prestige of their
owners. Nearly one-third of the respondents agreed with the proposi-
tion “Owning a motor vehicle, rather than a bicycle, is a status symbol.
It elevates social status and reputation.” Table 2 summarizes the re-
sponses on attitudinal questions. The ratings shown in Table 2 are on a
scale of 5. Zero denotes complete disagreement, 2 denotes a neutral
opinion, and 4 denotes complete agreement.
Among those who did not use school buses, 25.7% stated “Bus-stop
is not near to (their) home” as the reason for not using school buses.
Some parents speci<U+FB01>ed reasons not present among the options provided
in the survey form. Most frequent among these was the inherent dislike
for buses. The poor scores for school bus services in terms of user
perception could be due to a lack of adequate infrastructure, safety, and
comfort, both inside the buses and in areas surrounding bus stops. A
su<U+FB03>cient portion of respondents (14%) had their homes in the vicinity
of their schools, and hence, these responses were omitted from the set
of potential school bus users. After these rearrangements were made,
<U+FB01>nally, 31.3% respondents found greater distance to bus stop (option 2)
as the prime hindrance to traveling by school bus.
Of < 20% respondents who chose school bus as their regular mode
of travel, a considerable majority (83%) stated the main reason as
“(the) bus was safer for a child.” This is su<U+FB03>cient to suggest that the
school buses have a positive image, and parents perceive them to be a
safe mode of transport.
Table 2 shows high of response rates for all questions, except for the
statement on peer e<U+FB00>ect. Cross-tabulation of responses did not reveal
any consistency across the responses for these four statements in-
dicating that the chances of misunderstanding the statements or <U+FB01>lling
blind responses are low.
Similar to most cities across South Asia, data on built environment were
not available for Kanpur. To include basic built environment factors in the
model, the survey recorded the availability of sidewalk and presence of
major roads in the school neighborhood as proxies of built environment.
Census data on ward-level population were also extracted.

demographic variables. A quantitative explanatory model of choice
probabilities may complement the exploratory analysis. Logit models
are discrete choice models, most widely used in travel mode choice
studies. These models are based on the random utility theory.
According to this theory, each individual decision-maker has a unique
utility function and the alternative with the maximum utility is pre-
ferred over all other alternatives available in the choice set. In a logit
model, the random component of utility is assumed to be independent
and identically distributed (IID) across the individual choice-makers
and the alternatives (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985). Although several
standard approaches, such as nested logit, are available, the present

of motorized vehicles in school trips. Notably, the elasticity of choosing
bicycle or family vehicle was negative for distance. A unit percent in-
crease in distance decreased the probabilities of using bicycle or family
vehicle by 93.9% and 159.2% points, respectively. This result indicated
that parents would not drop-o<U+FB00> their children in their personal vehicles
if the distance to school is beyond a certain value. The positive elasticity
of girls to walk means that probability of walking is likely to be higher
for girl students compared with boys. Furthermore, the elasticity of girls
for bicycle was negative, indicating that girls were 12.8% points less
probable to cycle to school. This rea<U+FB03>rms gender role in active trans-

9. Conclusions

Only a few school travel mode choice studies have been conducted
in developing countries. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is
the <U+FB01>rst research to understand the school travel modal split in a South
Asian city. The <U+FB01>ndings suggested that the signi<U+FB01>cant determinants of
travel mode choice were distance (spatial variable); age and gender
(demographic); income, vehicle ownership including bicycles, and
employment status of parents (economic status); attitude toward non-
motorized travel and peer in<U+FB02>uence (context-speci<U+FB01>c); and, availability
of sidewalk and presence of a major road in vicinity of school (ease of
active travel). The relationships of travel mode choice with these at-
tributes were mostly consistent with previous research in the developed
societies.
This study identi<U+FB01>ed that children used nonmotorized modes for
their school trips if the school was not far and tended to travel by school
bus or family vehicle if school was at a greater distance. For students
who had to travel longer distances to school, the objective must be to
provide school bus service or reliable public transport, which can ac-
commodate children. In addition, more fundamental causes of longer
travel such as unbalanced distribution of schools (Cheng et al., 2017)
should also be systemically addressed by providing better-quality
neighborhood schools. This would facilitate a higher percentage of
students to walk or to ride a bicycle. This observation is similar to the
one made by Andersson et al. (2012) in Sweden where he observed a
trend that disadvantaged ethnic and social groups have a lower mobi-
lity-positional capital than less disadvantaged groups, which has an
in<U+FB02>uence on selecting closest schools for their kids, irrespective of their
qualities. Hence, the hypothesis that the better spatial distribution of
schools may not reduce the journey distances because of factors such as
cultural segregation and capacity constraints (Boussauw et al., 2014)

must be tested for the local context.
Another notable <U+FB01>nding of this study is the “second gender e<U+FB00>ect”
on the travel mode choice. Girls, in comparison to the boys, were less

likely to travel independently and odds were high that they would be
dropped-o<U+FB00> by their parents in personal vehicles. Girls were less likely
to use bicycle or auto rickshaw or tempo for traveling to school.

Mothers accompany their children mostly on foot and, therefore, this
will be viable for schools within walking distance. This re<U+FB02>ects a

con<U+FB01>rmation to the intuitive understanding that in gender-skewed so-
cieties, commuting to school is also sensitive to the social bias. A sys-
tematic study addressing this phenomenon is expected to bring out
some interesting results. The study also identi<U+FB01>ed the dependency of
children on their parents for school travel, particularly for older chil-
dren. The results indicated that a high proportion of children, both
younger and older, were accompanied to school. This result also is si-
milar to the <U+FB01>ndings from Germany (Scheiner, 2016). Hence, a study on
the parental accompanying behavior in an Indian context can provide
some detailed insights.
The primary survey conducted as part of the study reveals that the
larger section of school children in Kanpur travel shorter distances and
opt for the most sustainable modes, namely walking, bicycle and cycle
rickshaw. However, these modes are also most exposed to the road
crash risks in India. Therefore, while the policy implications of school
travel research in the economically advanced societies has been to
promote active transportation, it would be strategically more sound if
urban transportation planning and education policy in India, and more
speci<U+FB01>cally in Kanpur, aim to facilitate and augment the state of active
transport by building a safer built environment. Although there are
huge di<U+FB00>erences in the socio-economic characteristics of Kanpur com-
pared to those in most of the cities in Western Europe and North
America, the results from this study indicate that the relationships of
various factors in<U+FB02>uencing school trips do not have any remarkable
deviation from those found in the literature on school travel in North
America and Western Europe.
In this study, a few necessary practical compromises led to some
limitations. Travel distances were estimated on the basis of the nearest
landmarks reported by the respondents. The estimation of the error
associated with reporting could not be performed. Information on built
environment and neighborhood characteristics of household and school
could not be gathered because of a lack of data availability. Only lim-
ited data on sidewalk were collected, which may not account for the
quality of sidewalks and perception of pedestrians regarding the utility
of infrastructure. Interaction between variables such as gender, em-
ployment status and income has not been presented in the simple ex-
