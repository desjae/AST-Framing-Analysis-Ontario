Rural–urban variations
Data for 96 elementary schools in the school district are examined for statistical relationships between schoo
and catchment area size, rural–urban location, and reliance on school busing. To estimate potential walkability,
a mean Walk Score® was calculated for a 2.4-km pedestrian zone around each school, which represents the
school board’s courtesy busing threshold. Mode choices from “hands-up” tallies at four schools were employed to
calibrate the use of automobile and walking modes.
In inner-city areas, pedestrian zones typically covered almost 90% of the school catchment area, and their
walkability was moderately high. However, in suburban, commuter belt, and rural zones, much less area fell
within the pedestrian zone, and walkability declined considerably. The proportion of students who walked or
cycled for school travel were 40% (inner-city), 37% (suburbs), and only 5% in the commuter belt and rural
zones. On the other hand, more than 80% of children who lived in the commuter belt and rural zones rode the
bus, compared with 30% in the suburbs and only 6% in the inner-city areas. In both the suburban and inner-city
schools, a large proportion of students were chau<U+FB00>eured by car.
Findings suggest that post-1960 school planning for rural areas around Halifax has paid insu<U+FB03>cient attention
to the potential for children to walk or bike to school. Consequently, school consolidation and busing practices
should be reconsidered in light of their negative impacts on the health and well-being of suburban and rural
school children.

case study examines the size and con<U+FB01>guration of each school catch-
ment area (SCA), the walkability of the neighborhoods immediately
surrounding each school, and the extent of reliance on school busing.
To validate the analysis, data on revealed preferences for school travel
modes at four elementary schools are included in the study.

2. Previous studies

Mode choices for travel to school are important for a variety of
reasons, including e<U+FB00>ects on children’s health, environmental e<U+FB00>ects of
vehicular travel, time and <U+FB01>nancial costs to parents, and costs of busing
for school boards. There is a considerable literature on the health
bene<U+FB01>ts of AST, and much complementary research on environmental
and other costs related to vehicular school travel. Associated research
on mode choices has been well summarized recently by Ermagun and
Samimi (2015). A plethora of variables have been considered as in<U+FB02>u-
ential, and many have been shown to have statistically signi<U+FB01>cant ef-
fects. The speci<U+FB01>c variables may be grouped into several broad classes,
which we may term locational, environmental, socio-demographic, and
institutional. Locational factors relate to the child’s distance from the
school, which in turn is related to rural–urban di<U+FB00>erences in population
density, and to school sizes and siting (Ermagun and Samimi, 2017). In
addition, municipal transit services are typically unavailable in rural
and semi-rural areas (Ermagun and Levinson, 2017). Environmental
factors concern both built and natural environments along routes to
school, such as the presence/absence of sidewalks, or the perceived
crime rates in an area (e.g. Curtis et al., 2015; Yu and Zhu, 2015). Socio-
demographic factors include the age and sex of the child, family car
ownership, and family time-use constraints (e.g. Oliver et al., 2014).
Institutional factors concern policies on school size and siting, catch-
ment area boundaries, and provision of courtesy school busing
(Ermagun et al., 2015).

2.1. Health bene<U+FB01>ts of active school travel

Active school travel is an important component of youth’s physical
activity and social contact, as it can conveniently integrate physical
activity into children’s daily lives (Binns et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2007),
and provide opportunities for socialization (Zwerts et al., 2010). In-
deed, several health bene<U+FB01>ts are associated with walking and bicycling
for home-school travel (Lubans et al., 2011), including higher levels of
physical activity (Cooper et al., 2010; Voss and Sandercock, 2010),
more bene<U+FB01>cial weight status (Klein-Platat et al., 2005) and better
cardio-respiratory <U+FB01>tness (Chillón et al., 2012). Active school travel has
also been associated with higher cognitive and academic performance
(Martínez-Gómez et al., 2011), and greater independent mobility (Fyhri
and Hjorthol, 2009), which can promote several psychological skills
(Prezza et al., 2001). Yet, despite many health bene<U+FB01>ts associated with
AST modes, there is evidence in many Western nations that the pro-
portion of school children who use active modes for trips to and from
school has been consistently declining in recent decades, including the
United States (Ewing and Greene, 2003), United Kingdom (Dollman
et al., 2005), and Canada (Buliung et al., 2009).

2.2. Costs of vehicular school travel

Home-school vehicular travel, whether by car or bus, has important
environmental impacts, as it accounts for a considerable proportion of
all vehicle travel (McDonald et al., 2011). In the United States, 55% of
school trips were made by car in 2011, up from 16% in 1969, and this
increase has signi<U+FB01>cant implications in terms of tra<U+FB03>c congestion
around schools, localized air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and
reduced child safety in walking to and from school (Wilson et al., 2007).
There are burdens placed on those parents/guardians who chau<U+FB00>eur
their children between home and school, often requiring adjustments to
routes and schedules, and imposing a variety of costs (Litman, 2015). In


Case Studies on Transport Policy 7 (2019) 64–72


addition, especially in rural areas where large consolidated schools are
spaced far apart, school busing has become a major administrative cost.
Rural districts spend disproportionately on student transportation ser-
vices, and rural schools may spend upwards of 6 to 8 percent of their
budget on school busing, while non-rural districts spend around four
percent (Killeen and Sipple, 2000). Busing also has signi<U+FB01>cant costs to
the bused students, who often endure upwards of two hours per day in
bus travel, which has physical, social, and emotional implications. For
example, bused students report being stressed and tired, getting lower
grades, participating in fewer after-school activities, and spending less
time with their families (Eyre and Finn, 2002).

2.3. Locational and institutional in<U+FB02>uences on mode choice

Although environmental and socio-demographic variables are also
important determinants of mode choice, in this paper we focus only on
locational and institutional factors, with emphasis on rural–urban dif-
ferences. Distance from home to school is probably the single most
important determinant of mode choice for school travel (Duncan et al.,
2016; Ermagun and Samimi, 2017; Millward and Spinney, 2011;
Spinney and Millward, 2011; Spinney et al., 2018). School siting a<U+FB00>ects
this distance, as does the spatial distribution of the children being
served, and these two distributions are of course linked. When de-
termining the location of a new school and its future student popula-
tion, school boards typically consider a variety of competing require-
ments, such as demographics, land a<U+FB00>ordability, access to amenities,
attendance boundaries and con<U+FB01>guration, stability of student popula-
tion, travel distance, and the size of the property (Tsai and Miller,
2005). Until the 1950s, small neighborhood schools were the “anchor
points” of urban neighborhoods, which provided a wide range of after-
school programs, plus social and recreational services (Passmore,
2002). However, in recent decades, school size policies have tended to
favour the construction of larger schools, which are perceived to be
necessary to accommodate the continued expansion of academic and
recreational programs, provide the threshold student numbers to allow
provision of specialized infrastructure and student services, serve entire
communities, and allow for expansion in the future (McDonald, 2010;
Deka and von Hagen, 2015).
In the United States, studies have shown that elementary students in
rural areas are likely to experience bus rides that are 30 min or greater
than suburban students (Howley et al., 2001). Research has pointed out
the possible implications of rural school busing in terms of school
achievement, disruption of family life (e.g. reduced time available to
children and parents for recreational activities) and community cohe-
sion (Howley and Smith, 2000). Others have argued that long bus rides
have economic costs that are not accounted for in school consolidation
practices (Witham, 1997). Studies have also shown that parents often
mention long bus rides as a reason for opposing school district con-
solidation plans (Spence, 2000). Yet, the issue of rural school busing has
been surprisingly overlooked in the United States (Howley and Smith,
2000). Similarly, in Canada, very little is known about the e<U+FB00>ects of
school consolidation schemes, but data show that annual busing costs
have risen at a time of signi<U+FB01>cantly declining student enrolments, while
several community groups have started to promote healthy transpor-
tation alternatives and advocate for a closer look at the impacts of
school consolidation and busing on children’s health (Bennett and
Gillis, 2015).
In higher-density urban and suburban areas, the catchment areas of
newer and larger schools may still be small enough to allow many
students to choose AST modes. However, in lower-density rural areas,
the shift to larger schools has required consolidation of formerly loca-
lized catchment areas into extensive ones that are almost entirely re-
liant on school busing (Killeen and Sipple, 2000). These consolidated
school districts in rural areas are characterized by low student densities
spread over large geographic areas, with schools often placed in iso-
lated locations, equally far from several population clusters. In turn,

di<U+FB00>erences across settlement zones exist. The average SCA size for inner
city schools is only 2.1 km2. However, average SCA areas become ex-
ponentially larger as one moves outwards, and approach 300 km2 in the
rural areas. Student density presents a reverse pattern, declining from
the center until reaching only one student per km2 in rural areas. The
spatial relationships between SCAs and pedestrian zones also vary
considerably across the school district. Inner-city areas of Halifax and
Dartmouth, on average, have pedestrian zones that cover nearly all the
catchment areas’ land, and six catchment areas are 100% within HRSB’s
walking threshold. In the suburbs, the pedestrian zones still cover over
half the SCA’s, on average, but in the ICB and rural areas only small
portions of SCA’s are covered by pedestrian zones.
In terms of school siting, especially in suburban and rural areas,
schools tend to be located in auto-dependent neighborhoods, where the
pedestrian zones surrounding the schools present very low walkability
scores. As shown in Fig. 3, while the median Walk Score® was 64.5 for
inner city schools, corresponding to a “somewhat walkable” category,
all the other schools’ walk zones had very low Walk Scores®, delineating

the longer distances to frequently visited amenities.
The population density of areas surrounding schools is pertinent to
both school siting and school travel mode choice. In the inner city,
elementary schools are in census tracts with an average dwelling den-

and in close proximity to residential dwellings. In the other settlement

zones, elementary schools are much more likely to be situated on the

outskirts of communities, and typically more distant from residential

properties, which results in fewer children living within a convenient

walking distance.

With more children living farther from their school, it is not sur-

prising that a large proportion of elementary students need to be bused.

During the 2015/16 school year, more than 80% of children living in

the inner commuter belt and rural areas had to be bused between home

and school. In the suburbs, about 30% of students needed bus services,

the school’s SCA has the strongest correlation with busing, and other
variables associated with it (student density and PZ as percent of SCA
area) also show similarly large and signi<U+FB01>cant correlations. Interest-
ingly, school busing was negatively correlated with the Walk Score® of

the pedestrian zone (<U+03C1> = -0.69; p < 0.01). Since students living in the
pedestrian zone are not entitled to busing, one might expect no e<U+FB00>ect.

However, the two variables are linked symptoms of low residential
density in rural areas. Only a small proportion of ICB and rural students
reside within pedestrian zones, and as Fig. 5 suggests, even the pe-
destrian zones display low connectivity, and low land-use mix.

School age is negatively and signi<U+FB01>cantly correlated with school



busing, indicating that more recent schools tend to be built farther
away from densely populated areas. The relationship, however, is not

very strong. As to school size, it is noteworthy that this variable,
measured by enrollment, lacks a signi<U+FB01>cant correlation with percent of
students bussed. This is understandable when we note that ICB schools
have large enrollments, while rural schools have low enrollments, but
both are heavily reliant on busing.

The “hands-up” tally data con<U+FB01>rmed that students in suburban

schools are less likely to walk or bike to school, and more likely to ride

the school bus. As shown in Table 5, on average, 38% of school children

walked to suburban schools and 20% rode the school bus, compared to

49% of inner-city school children and 1% rode the school bus. For ex-

ample, the suburban Colby Village school shows a high proportion of

walking, and also has key characteristics of an inner-city school, no-

tably a small SCA area and high proportion of SCA in the PZ. In con-

trast, Cavalier Drive is perhaps more typically suburban, with less

5. Discussion

This study shows that larger catchment areas greatly constrain the
possibility for elementary school children in the Halifax region to be
physically active for their journey to and from school. Rural-urban
contrasts in walkability are very strong: for inner-city schools, on
average, 90% of their catchment area (and presumably of their stu-
dents) lies within walking range (2.4 km), and this proportion remains
over 60% in the suburbs. Beyond the continuously-developed suburbs,
however, in the exurban inner commuter belt (ICB), there is a marked
decline to only 8%, and the proportion is a woeful 2% in rural areas.
Parents in the commuter belt and rural zones mostly, therefore, rely on

school bus services, and over 80% of students in both zones are bused.
By extension, results suggest that approximately 5% of students in both
ICB and rural zones employ AST modes, and 15% are chau<U+FB00>eured by

their parents.
These results show how post-1960 school planning for rural areas of
the HRSB has paid insu<U+FB03>cient attention to the potential for children to
walk or bike to school and to the imposition of unnecessarily long bus
commutes. To some extent, reliance on busing in the countryside is
unavoidable, but it was not always so. In the days of the one-room
schoolhouse, common into the 1960s, schools were present in most
rural communities, and the majority of rural students walked to school.

The adoption of policies favoring large consolidated schools, while
made for sound administrative and pedagogic reasons, required schools
sited far apart, and had seemingly incidental, but seriously negative,


e<U+FB00>ects on student welfare. Walking to and from school is no longer an
option for most Nova Scotian students, and many now spend long hours

on the bus. An issue that warrants increased attention from academics,
school planners, and public health practitioners alike.
This case study used HRSB busing data for all elementary schools
throughout the entire study area, but only had access to data on
walking and parental chau<U+FB00>euring for a limited number of schools in


the inner-city and suburbs. “Hands-up” tallies for these schools, how-

ever, clearly indicate that many parents who live within the 2.4 km
pedestrian zone still choose to drive their children to school, supporting
those studies that have found that many parents drive their children
regardless of distance (He and Giuliano, 2017; Lee et al., 2013) or the
walkability of the environment (Mah et al., 2017). This is perhaps more
understandable in the auto-oriented suburbs, either because the parents
themselves commute by automobile and can conveniently combine the
trips, while spending time with their children (Westman et al., 2017), or
because suburban households are more likely to have two vehicles, thus
