physical activity and mode choice of school trip are reviewed, followed
by a discussion on the research method, and a description of the em-
ployed data for the analysis. Then, a three-level nested logit model is
tested to scrutinize the in<U+FB02>uential variables on mode choice decisions of
school trips. Using the model, selected policies promoting active modes
of travel to school are evaluated in terms of their cost savings in the
health care. The paper concludes with remarks that underscore poten-
tial bene<U+FB01>ts in active modes of travel to school and suggestions for
future studies.

2. Background

This section provides a background on how the health bene<U+FB01>ts of
physical activity are quanti<U+FB01>ed, followed by a review on the research
that discusses children’s tendencies to walk in school trips. This re-
search is not to introduce a new cost estimation method, but rather to
apply a conventional approach to quantify the health bene<U+FB01>ts of pro-
moting active modes of travel among students. Therefore, reviews of
both subjects are essential.

2.1. Health bene<U+FB01>ts of physical activity

Physical activity aids in obesity prevention, especially in children
(Sallis et al., 2004), although there are other physical and mental
bene<U+FB01>ts as well (Lawlor and Hopker, 2001). One reason for such a
tendency is that obesity itself stimulates several other diseases to the
extent that more than 20% of the healthcare expenditures in the U.S.
are associated with obesity (Cawley and Meyerhoefer, 2012). Table 1
compares some studies that investigated obesity costs in di<U+FB00>erent
countries. As seen, these costs vary among di<U+FB00>erent European countries
and account between 0.09% and 0.61% of their GDP (Fry and Finley,
2005). Similarly, studies in Canada (Birmingham et al., 1999) and
Australia (Segal et al., 1994) found that around 0.2% to 0.6% of their
GDP is spent on obesity related costs. Studies in the United States (Wolf
and Colditz, 1998; Colditz, 1992) show that obesity related costs are
between 70 and 90 billion dollars, which is about 0.95% to 1.74% of
the GDP. This amount might be due to higher prevalence of obesity in
the U.S. (Müller-Riemenschneider et al., 2008). Obesity costs are clas-
si<U+FB01>ed into direct and indirect costs, with much less awareness from the
latter (Fry and Finley, 2005). Direct costs are usually de<U+FB01>ned as a dollar
value of personal healthcare, hospital-care, nursing services, and
medication costs. Indirect costs are generally de<U+FB01>ned as the value of lost
productivity due to sickness or early death (Colditz, 1992). Few studies
(Popkin et al., 2006; Borg et al., 2005) have investigated direct and

indirect obesity costs separately. Popkin et al. (2006) found in China
that direct and indirect obesity costs account for 0.48% and 3.58% of
the GDP, respectively.
There are two common approaches to quantify obesity costs. First,
diseases that are caused by obesity are determined along with the
magnitude of their e<U+FB00>ect. Having the costs of each speci<U+FB01>c disease, the
obesity cost is then estimated. A study (Colditz, 1992) in the U.S.
showed that poor health is rooted in obesity. In 1992, 57% of in-
dividuals with type II diabetes and 90% of the people with gallbladder
disease caused by obesity cost 11.3 and 2.4 billion dollars in health
costs, respectively. Further, Colditz (1992) argued that 19% of expenses
related to cardiovascular diseases (around 22 billion dollars) are due to
obesity. This study also pointed out that the economic cost of obesity is
around 5.5% of total healthcare costs, which is approximately 39.3
billion dollars.
In the second approach, total healthcare expenses are collected in a
speci<U+FB01>ed period of time. Then, itemized costs, including hospitalization,
doctors’ visits, and non-functionality periods, are approximated based
on the manuals such as Working Group Methods in Health Economic
Evaluation (Krauth et al., 2005). Finally, costs of obesity are estimated
pursuant to the observed Body Mass Index (BMI) for a sampled popu-
lation. Wolfenstetter (2012) conducted a study based on this approach
among 2581 individuals aged 25 to 65 in Germany. The information on
hospitalization and ambulatory care of individuals in a 12-month
period was gathered through personal interviews, along with additional
information on weight and height. The result showed that direct and
indirect costs are, respectively, 1093 and 2474 Euros per year for
people su<U+FB00>ering from obesity.

2.2. School trip behavior and health bene<U+FB01>ts of active modes of travel

The school trip behavior has become a hot debate among policy-
makers and academics (Ermagun and Levinson, 2016). Recent research,
which supports these concerns, focuses mainly on students’ health and
the side e<U+FB00>ects of school trips’ from a city planner’s point of view.
Policymakers are looking for new ways of promoting physical activity
in the student’s daily routine. Studies recommend at least 60 min of
daily physical activity for students (Salmon and Timperio, 2007). These
recommendations can be partially realized through various travel
modes, including, walking, biking, and taking public transit during
school trips (Tudor-Locke et al., 2001).
Studies (Ermagun et al., 2015a, 2015b; McDonald, 2008a;
Schlossberg et al., 2005, 2006; Dellinger and Centers for Disease
Control Prevention, 2002) have been conducted to explore the

In the second step, the elasticity of policy sensitive variables is ac-
cessed using the estimated model. Elasticity of a variable is the per-
centage change in the probability of the decision variable, when the
variable of interest is increased by 1% (Hensher et al., 2005). An
elasticity of -0.2 for travel distance, for instance, implies that students’
probability to walk is increased by 0.2% for every percent decrease in
the home to school distance. To estimate the elasticity, the change in
the probability of the decision variable should be calculated for each
individual observation and then averaged over the entire sample. To
calculate the direct and cross elasticity of continuous variables, equa-
tion 4 and equation 5 are used, respectively (Wen and Koppelman,
2001). The direct elasticity formula is collapsed to (1 - Pi) ßxi when i is
assigned to a single nest with no other alternatives. Likewise, the cross
elasticity is collapsed to -Pnßxi in this condition. This concept of
elasticity could not be applied to 0–1 variables, such as Safety, since 1%
change in a dummy variable is meaningless (Hensher et al., 2005).
Instead, pseudo-elasticity is used that implies the magnitude of change
in the probability of the decision variable when the dummy variable is
increased from 0 to 1.

In the third step, the costs of obesity for each person, both direct and
indirect, are determined. Comprehensive studies that quantify obesity
costs are rarely conducted in Iran and very sporadic worldwide.
Edwards (2008), for instance, translated minutes spent walking into
energy consumption and the reduction in obesity prevalence. He found
that the return cost of 8.3 min moderate walking is almost $4500 dol-
lars annually. However, in a more detailed study, Genter et al. (2008)
showed that direct and indirect obesity return costs of one kilometer of
moderate walking is US$4.27 per person. Outputs of the latter study are
utilized to translate obesity cost returns of di<U+FB00>erent policies that target
school trip modal selection behaviors.

In the fourth step, economic bene<U+FB01>ts are estimated for the reduction

of obesity in regard to the policy sensitive variables of interest, namely
(2)         home-to-school distance and safety. The results are discussed for dif-
ferent segments of population with respect to gender, age, income, and
car ownership. The health cost saving is calculated in three phases:

(3)
1. We transformed the walking travel time to distance for home to
school along with the access and egress of public transit. The
walking times were asked in the questionnaire and modi<U+FB01>ed by
Google maps information, inputting the origin and destination of
each trip. Assuming an average walking speed of 4.8 km/h for stu-
dents (O’Sullivan and Morrall, 1996), we <U+FB01>nally converted the
walking travel times to distance.
2. We calculated the average change in walking distance using the
elasticity value of interest parameters for walking and public transit
modes of travel. Public transit encompasses walking for children
who walk in their access and egress. Thus, this walking travel dis-
tance is also considered in the analysis.
3. We <U+FB01>nally multiplied the average change in walking distance by US
$4.27, the direct and indirect obesity returns of one kilometer of
moderate walking. This health savings is estimated among di<U+FB00>erent
segments of population. Although adopting the U.S. cost rates may
be argued due to the di<U+FB00>erences in health care system and medical
costs, we employed such rates due to unavailability of reliable local
data.

infrequent usage in Tehran. Transit, private car, and school bus are
classi<U+FB01>ed under the non-active nest. Non-active nest extends into two
sub-nests, namely transit and private. The latter is then divided into
school bus and private car. The developed tree structure has a better <U+FB01>t
than other possible structures, as per pseudo McFadden R squared

Table 4 represents the estimates of the model based on the <U+FB01>nal
nesting structure. The nest parameters are <U+FB01>xed to 1 for active nest and
transit sub-nest, since they include only one alternative (Hensher et al.,
2005). The other nest parameters, however, are determined in a full
information maximum likelihood estimation process. As seen, the nest
parameters are signi<U+FB01>cantly greater than 0 according to the student’s t-

Age and gender of students were found signi<U+FB01>cant among the stu-

dent characteristics. We found a negative correlation between age and

probability of school busing, and positive correlation between age and
taking public transit. This may be due to the tendency of older students
to seek independence (Loureiro and Gaspar de Matos, 2014; Mitra et al.,
Error         2010; McDonald, 2008b). We found girls more likely to walk, and less
likely to take public transit. Due to some cultural and social limitations

for girls in Tehran (Samimi and Ermagun, 2012), they may have less
opportunity to participate in outside school activities, which makes
them more willing to walk to school and <U+FB01>nd more independent op-

portunities to socialize.


Number of vehicles, family income, and parental education were
found e<U+FB00>ective among the household characteristics. In accordance
with previous studies (Zwerts et al., 2010; McDonald, 2008a), we also
found a greater probability of taking public transit and walking di-

minishes as car ownership increases. This may be attributed to the low

cost of private car use in Tehran. Further, high-income households are
more likely to use school buses, as this type of service is provided by the
private sector and low-income families cannot generally a<U+FB00>ord it. Si-

milarly, parents with at least a college degree have less probability of


using public transit or walking.
Travel distance, access to transit station, population density, and
travel time/cost are among the built environment characteristics that
are found signi<U+FB01>cant in the model. As expected, travel distance and

willingness to walk are negatively correlated. Similarly, better access to

transit stations motivates the use of public transit to school. We further
found a positive association between population density and will-
ingness to walk. This tendency is attributed to higher levels of safety in
more dense areas. Auto travel time and cost were also found instru-


mental on transportation mode choice with a negative impact on pri-
vate car desirability. It should be noted that we have set non-chosen
mode attributes to zero. Normalized auto travel cost (cost over income)
is used in the model to demonstrate a systematic taste variation among

households with di<U+FB00>erent levels of income (Train, 2009).

Comfort and safety are two signi<U+FB01>cant dummy variables in the
model that show parental reservations about their children’s travel
mode. In line with previous studies (Loureiro and Gaspar de Matos,

2014; McDonald and Aalborg, 2009), we found safety is the <U+FB01>rst and
foremost concern of parents who do not encourage walking and public
transit modes in school trips. It could be because the Tehran transit
system is overcrowded and unreliable, in particular, during morning
peak hours when children are travelling to school. A study in the United
States (Transportation Research Board, 2002), for example, stated that
the rate of injury and death among children who walk or bike to school
is 40% more than children who use school bus or private car. Similarly,
another study (Roberts et al., 1995) in New Zealand showed that ac-
cident probability is 14 times more likely for students who walk in
congested streets with more than 750 vehicles per hour than that in
streets with less than 250 vehicles per hours. Such concerns triggered
more than 50% of parents to personally pick up and drop o<U+FB00> their

children (Boarnet et al., 2005). We found that parents are also con-
cerned about their children’s travel convenience on school trips. Similar

to previous studies (McDonald and Aalborg, 2009), the results show

that parents, who are concerned about their child’s convenience, are
more inclined toward school bus.

5.2. Elasticity analysis

Table 5 shows the elasticity of interest variables. The elasticity of
AUTO_TIME variable shows that a 1% increase in private car travel time
diminishes the probability of choosing this mode of travel by 0.190%.
As a result, the probability of public transit, school bus, and walking
increases by 0.056%, 0.071%, and 0.030%, respectively. A 1% increase
in home-to-school distance decreases the probability of walking by
1.940%. However, the probability of other modes of travel increases by
0.598%. An increase of 1% in population density has a positive corre-
lation with probability of walking by 0.147%.
The pseudo-elasticity analysis indicates the change in probability of
choosing various modes of travel, when the value of dummy variables
shifts from 0 to 1. The results of SAFETY variable, for instance, show
parental safety concern may diminish the probability of walking by
59.92%. The probability of driving and school busing increases by
117.70% among these families. If parents accompany their child to
school, it is less probable to walk by 67.13%. It is interesting to follow
the elasticity of other variables in Table 5.

6. Policy assessment

This section argues for an estimation and discussion on the expected
economic savings from obesity reduction due to active travel modes to
school. As shown in Table 6, obesity costs are estimated for two major
policies: (1) to improve the level of safety for school trips and (2) to
decrease home-to-school distance by advocating neighborhood schools.
Each item is further discussed in two parts: discussing practical ways to
implement the policy and identifying the expected monetary saving for
obesity reduction. To calculate the daily return cost per capita, we
multiplied the daily walking increase in kilometers by 4.27, which is
the direct and indirect obesity return of one kilometer of moderate
walking. The daily return cost per capita is then multiplied by the 210
school days in Tehran. This results in the annual return cost per capita.
This study found that an average of $719.3 saving per year in the
direct and indirect costs of obesity is expected for each student, if safety
concerns of parents regarding their children’s school trips are resolved.
This amount varies among di<U+FB00>erent student segments. For instance, this
saving is $40 more for girls than boys, since on average they are more
likely to walk to school. As shown in Table 6, high-income households
would bene<U+FB01>t more from safe routes to school programs. Elasticity

values are valid in a small vicinity of the observed values. Pseudo-
elasticity of dummy variables should then be cautiously considered
since large changes, which are unavoidable for dummy variables, could
be questionable. Therefore, we should be cautious to compare the re-
sults of continuous variables versus dummy variables, as the former is a
1% change and the latter is a movement from 0 to 1.
Various policies, including walking services and enhancing pedes-
trian facilities, have been practiced worldwide to enhance the safety of
school trips (Matthews, 1992). Safe routes to school (Staunton et al.,
2003) is a program that aims to create safe, convenient, and amusing
opportunities to promote walking and biking among students. For in-
stance, in 2005, the U.S. Congress approved legislation to make safe
routes to school in 50 states of America (SAFETEA-LU, 2005). In ac-
cordance with the law, $612-million was distributed over a period of 4
years. Each state was obligated to enhance pedestrian facilities, and to
provide applicable educational programs. Alameda, California is an-
other example that extensively promoted active travel modes among
students by making the routes safer (McDonald, 2007b). The city spent
more than 2.3 million dollars in 2010 to execute three main plans for
215,000 students. Safety policies are costly, thus city o<U+FB03>cials need to
be aware of the potential health bene<U+FB01>ts for children before policy
implementation.
We also found a reduction in the annual obesity costs by about
$30.50 per person, if distance to school is reduced by 1%. However, the
amount of <U+FB01>nancial savings varies among di<U+FB00>erent segments of society.
Reducing travel distance by 1% for middle and high school students, for
example, increases daily walking amount by 26.9 and 45.1 m on
average, respectively. Such <U+FB01>ndings allow city o<U+FB03>cials to apply tailored
policies in di<U+FB00>erent neighborhoods. Eventually, as illustrated in
Table 3, the average home to school walking distance is about 980 m in
Tehran. Our study demonstrated that by reducing this walking distance
to 800 m, annual direct and indirect costs of obesity decrease about
$687 per person. If city planners want to promote walking, long-term
policies such as building schools near residential complexes instead of
city outskirts should be considered. This way, accurate identi<U+FB01>cation of
students’ distribution across the city, land uses, transportation system,
and a broad economic justi<U+FB01>cation of such policies are essential. Pro-
moting neighborhood schools have obvious health bene<U+FB01>ts for students,
as they are more accessible on foot. Social drawbacks are discussed in
the literature (McDonald, 2010), since developing neighborhood
schools may delay the growth of under-developed communities. Sup-
porting local or regional schools are generally costly for the govern-
ments, and a <U+FB01>nancial justi<U+FB01>cation is keenly desired. California, for
instance, spent about $25 billion in order to enhance infrastructures

and school facilities from 2002 to 2004 (McDonald, 2008a). Having an
estimate of the health bene<U+FB01>ts of a neighborhood school could help
decision makers get a broader picture of the policies before im-
plementation.

7. Conclusion

This study was an attempt to estimate direct and indirect obesity
cost savings that are expected when active modes of travel are pro-
moted among students in Tehran. The study investigated the behavior
of choosing transportation modes in school trips by applying a three-
level nested logit model. Identifying the e<U+FB00>ective variables on the
parents’ choice of travel mode is essential for researchers and policy-
makers to encourage active travel modes in school trips. This provides
an opportunity to increase physical activity in the adolescent period
and prevent public health problems in the future. Moreover, promoting
the use of active transportation modes in school trips will reduce
morning tra<U+FB03>c congestion, which comes with environmental bene<U+FB01>ts
as well. Active travel modes to school are expected to decrease in the

coming decade(s) if current policies remain in-place. Vehicle ownership
is increasing and travel safety concerns are growing. This is expected to
lean parents toward non-active modes of travel. A tremendous amount

of health bene<U+FB01>ts, on the other hand, are expected, should active modes
of travel be encouraged.
On the analysis side, this study investigated a broad range of in-

<U+FB02>uential variables on mode choice decisions. Parental attitudes and

built environment variables need to be studied more closely so that
policy or coordinated programs such as “safe routes to school” and

“walking school bus” can be implemented successfully to continue to

incentivize parents to use active transportation modes.
On the policy side, the purpose of this study was to inform policy-
makers of the <U+FB01>nancial health bene<U+FB01>ts of encouraging walking for

school trips. These <U+FB01>ndings may help policy makers better apply policy
both in the short and long term, which may include “safe routes to
school” and “school sitting” (McDonald, 2010). The <U+FB01>ndings of this

study demonstrated that if parental safety concerns are alleviated re-
garding their children walking to school, both the annual direct and
indirect costs of obesity per capita falls by US$719.3. Findings also

demonstrated that the potential enactment of such alleviation policies
among di<U+FB00>erent sections of society yields di<U+FB00>erent outcomes. For in-
stance, tackling parental safety concerns advances active travel modes,

particularly among girls and high school students, while low income
families experienced the smallest increase in active modes. Such <U+FB01>nd-
ings can better inform policy makers in the implementation of public

policy. Among other <U+FB01>ndings in this study was that if the distance from

home to school is decreased by 1%, the annual per capita health costs
associated with obesity fall by about $30.50. Such studies could inform
policymakers of the potential costs and bene<U+FB01>ts that are expected to

come with active travelling of students.
While the results of this research o<U+FB00>ered important insights into the
role of the long- and short-term policies to promote active transporta-

tion modes in diminishing costs of obesity, there are limitations that
make room for future studies.


• This study only collected the information of school trips among

middle and high school students. Elementary school should be
considered to complete the study, because it is expected to have

di<U+FB00>erent trip patterns, although the survey methodology can be
various for this age range.
•   Instead of using obesity cost rates from another country, one way to

obtain more realistic results is to perform such local studies. Yet

scant evidence has been o<U+FB00>ered to indicate the either direct or in-
direct costs of obesity in Tehran.

•   Built environment variables including pedestrian density, green

space availability, and other land use variables could be appended
to the data at a disaggregate level.

• Systematic    taste variation was investigated due to nested logit
models, while mixed logit models also have the capability of con-
sidering random taste variation.
•   Public transit is a quasi-active mode of travel due to encompassing
walking and biking in the most of access and egress trips.
Considering a cross nested logit model hosting public transit mode
in both active and non-active nests may improve the results of
modeling.
