of children’s mean age for independent active travel; and at the same time a decrease of independent
active school-home travel and leisure time activities. Parental fear regarding traf<U+FB01>c is the most frequent
cause for concern regarding children’s safety when they are outdoors. Stranger danger and low sense of
community are more prevalent in parents from the highly-urbanized environment. Overall, girls enjoy
less actual mobility than boys. The discussion shows that children’s freedom of movement in the
highly-urbanized setting is very restricted due to a pervasive automobile dependence, proposing a shift
from a motorized to a walkable city.

using an integrative model, revealed that loneliness, as a result of
weak communities ties, low sense of security and less frequent
social activities with peers, is a consequence of children’s low inde-
pendent mobility.
Nevertheless and despite its crucial importance on children’s
well-being and development, several studies indicate that chil-
dren’s independent mobility has drastically reduced throughout
the last decades in many countries, such as Portugal (Arez and
Neto, 1999), England and Australia (Carver et al., 2013) and New
Zealand (Oliver et al., 2011).
The decrease of CIM seems to be related with a set of environ-
mental and sociocultural transformations that have taken place in
industrialized countries over the past few decades. According to
Tranter and Sharpe (2012), these changes have a common denom-
inator sustained on the availability of cheap oil, which enabled
modern urban societies to favor the widespread use of car on pub-
lic space. This pedestrian unfriendly urban planning supports the
pervasiveness of a motorized car culture, increasing parental con-
cern on children’s safety due to the risk of them being involved
in car caused accidents, as a consequence of fast and reckless driv-
ing and lack of walking facilities and crossings (Malone and
Rudner, 2011). Fyhri et al. (2011) carried out a study in Denmark,
Finland, Great Britain and Norway, and concluded that longer dis-
tances to school, traf<U+FB01>c, parents own convenience, children attend-
ing organized leisure time activities, more time pressure to
families, increased access to car and use of mobile phones for
transport arrangements have caused a decrease on children’s
active and independent mobility. Social fears reported by parents

as fear of crime, stranger danger, abduction and being bullied or
molested by older children are also documented as obstacles to

children’s freedom in public space (Alparone and Pacilli, 2012;

Gill, 2007; Zubrick et al., 2010).



1.2. Mobility licenses and modes of travel


CIM was <U+FB01>rst operationalized by the work of Hillman et al.

(1990), as a set of licenses granted by parents allowing children

to move around autonomously in the environment. This set of

licenses is de<U+FB01>ned as whether children are allowed without adult

supervision to: cross main roads, travel the home-school journey,

go to other places than school (walking distance scope), ride their

bicycle, use public transportation and go out after dark (Carver

et al., 2013; Hillman et al., 1990; Kyttä, 1997, 2004; O’Brien

et al., 2000). Likewise, children’s traveling to places without the

accompaniment of adults is associated with active transportation

such as walking, cycling and public transport use (Fyhri et al.,

2011; Hillman et al., 1990; Sharpe and Tranter, 2010). School and

leisure time activities are meaningful places for children (Broberg

et al., 2013; Kyttä et al., 2012) and therefore should be accessed

and traveled to autonomously and actively (Rissotto and Tonucci,

1999).

However, recent and past data has concluded that most chil-
dren are being driven to school and to leisure time activities, pre-
venting them of active travel forms (Mackett, 2002; Mammen
et al., 2012; Mclaren and Parusel, 2012). On this topic, Hjorthol
and Fyhri (2009) show in their study a decrease in children’s
autonomy when going to leisure activities, these generally being
organized and taking place outside the immediate neighborhood.
The authors also mention that a large proportion of Norwegian
children, between 6 and 12 years old, are driven to organized lei-
sure activities. Simultaneously, they found out that increasing
parental anxiety about traf<U+FB01>c caused a decrease in children’s inde-
pendence. According to Deka (2013) adults’ choice of driving to
work signi<U+FB01>cantly increases the probability of children being dri-
ven to school and decreases their likelihood of walking and cycling.

1.3. Degree of urbanization and children’s independent mobility

According to Johansson (2006) study about CIM to leisure
places adopting Küllers Human Environment Interaction (HEI)
model, parental decision to allow for child’s independent or driven
mobility is an emotional process in<U+FB02>uenced by the characteristics
of the leisure activity, physical and social environment, individual
parental factors and characteristics of the child. Also, in the study
conducted by Alparone and Pacilli (2012), the authors conclude
that CIM is in<U+FB02>uenced by the interplay of personal, environmental
and psychosocial variables hinged on the bioecological model of
human development proposed by Bronfenbrenner (1979). Based
on the previous theoretical models, physical environment charac-
teristics either promote or hinder CIM. Hence, the degree of urban-
ization is a rather relevant environmental feature that in<U+FB02>uences
parents decision to enable or unable children’s independent travel,
as well as it may potentiate or hinder children’s possibilities to
actualize their interactions with the environment. On this subject,
Kyttä (2004) notes that characteristics of the environment, as well
as the degree of freedom children have to explore it have great
impact on how they perceive, act and move in their surroundings.
If in the past it was clearer that rural environments afforded better
possibilities for children’s freedom of movement than more urban-
ized environments, nowadays, consistent results in many studies
confront those earlier <U+FB01>ndings (Broberg et al., 2013; Carver et al.,
2012; Kyttä et al., 2012).


1.4. Aim of study


A considerable amount of research has been produced interna-

tionally about CIM and its variation in terms of the urban/rural

environment dichotomy. In Portugal, so far, most available data
on CIM is of descriptive nature. Preliminary results of an interna-
tional research show that CIM of Portuguese children occupies

the 10th place among a total of 16 countries, led by Finland and fol-
lowed by Japan and reared by Italy and Sri Lanka, respectively

(Bicket, 2013). However, less attention has been paid to the in<U+FB02>u-

ence of urbanization in children’s freedom of movement. More-

over, national research has been scarce in studying how prone

the city environment is for children’s autonomy and independent

active travel. Therefore, the current research closes this gap by

addressing children’s mobility in the above terms in order to gain

a more wholesome perspective of this phenomenon. The purpose

of this paper is <U+FB01>rstly to characterize psychosocial factors that

affect CIM, namely, parental fears regarding children’s safety; and

perception on sense of community, in the highly, moderately and

non-urbanized environments. Secondly, is to assess how children’s

mobility licenses and actual mobility vary in a highly, moderately

and non urbanized types of environment. Lastly, is to draw atten-

tion to the speci<U+FB01>c case of CIM in the highly-urbanized setting (city

environment) proposing a shift in the city from a motorized and

dependent children’s mobility to an active and autonomous one.


2. Methodology

2.1. Participants

Participants were selected from the Portuguese sample
(n = 1099, 16 schools involved) which was part of an international
comparison research on CIM, led by researchers at Policy Studies
Institute (PSI), London. According the international CIM research
guided by PSI, <U+FB01>ve types of settlements were indicated, ‘‘Inner
City’’, ‘‘Urban’’, ‘‘Suburban, ‘‘Small Town’’ and ‘‘Rural’’.
To study effect of urbanization degree in CIM, three types of
environments were extracted from the original sample, namely,

212                                           F. Lopes et al. / Journal of Transport
‘‘Inner City’’ (n1 = 223; 54% boys, 46% girls) as ‘‘highly-urbanized’’;
‘‘Small town’’ (n2 = 192, 44% boys, 56% girls) as ‘‘moderately-urban-
ized’’; and ‘‘Rural’’ (n3 = 137, 48% boys, 52% girls) as ‘‘non-urban-
ized’’. The urbanizing categories of our sample were devised
upon population density and other relevant territorial information
available in the of<U+FB01>cial web sites of the local councils, and in the
Statistics Portugal web site (INE). The ‘‘highly urbanized’’ setting
is constituted by the areas that correspond to the center of Lisbon
(parish of São João de Brito). This is considered a typical consoli-
dated inner urban area with moderate dense housing, easy access
to public transport, different services and cultural areas, and with a
population density of 5143.4 people/km2. The ‘‘moderately-urban-
ized’’ setting corresponds to the small town of Silves in the south of
the country. Silves has a population density of 54.6 people/km2;
limited use of public transportation (due to lack of connections);
moderate dense housing, different services and cultural areas;
characterized by a loss of active population in the last 30 years
due to migratory <U+FB02>uxes. The ‘‘non-urbanized’’ setting corresponds
to Redondo in the southeast-central of the country. Redondo is a
typical rural area characterized by a concentrated settlement of
houses and population and by the deserti<U+FB01>cation tendency of rural
spaces. It has a population density of 19.02 people/km2, restricted
access          to        public        transportation               (almost
nonexistent), few services and lack of cultural areas. For some anal-
ysis children were grouped in primary (3rd to 6th grade;
Mage = 9.81 yrs; SD = 1.45) and secondary (7th to 10th grade; M
age = 13.89 yrs; SD = 0.99) school types. In order to conduct this
study, Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee
of Faculdade de Motricidade Humana, Universidade de Lisboa, as
well as authorization from the General Department of Education
from the Portuguese Education and Science Ministry.

2.2. Methods and data collection

The international child independent mobility questionnaires for
parents and children used by PSI researchers were translated to
Portuguese. Following initial contact and agreement with each
school, parental consent for each child and parent participation
in the study was requested. Parents were sent a package with a
consent form and a parental questionnaire to be completed at
home. Children that were allowed to participate have also
completed a questionnaire in school. In order to link the correct
questionnaires between parents and children, each dyad was
linked by a unique and shared code on both questionnaires. Data
collection occurred during 2011 (Spring-time) in the moderately
and non-urban settlements and in 2012 (Spring-time) in the
highly-urbanized one.

2.3. Measures and data analysis
The in<U+FB02>uence of gender was analyzed in this present study, in
the overall sample and in some cases within the different territo-
rial typologies. In order to characterize psychosocial factors that
affect CIM, parental perception regarding children’s safety was
measured as ‘‘reasons to collect children at school’’, ‘‘concern about
the risk of the child being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident when
crossing a road’’; ‘‘sense of neighborhood safety’’ and ‘‘sense of
community’’. In order to study CIM according to the degree of
urbanization, children’s age for independent active travel, mobility
licenses, actual mobility in the home-school trajectory and in
weekend leisure time activities were also measured. These
variables and questions that were used to compose them and
parents’/children’s possible answers are depicted in Table 1.
Frequency analysis and Chi Square tests were performed to
analyze differences in reasons to collect children at school,
mobility licenses and actual mobility on the home-school trajec-

tory among the three research environments and by gender. Uni-
variate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Scheffe tests
were conducted to compare levels of concern about the risk of
the child being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident when crossing a road,
sense of neighborhood safety, perception on sense of community,
children’s age for independent active travel and actual mobility
during weekend leisure time activities. Independent sample t tests
were conducted to investigate gender differences in these
variables. Also, descriptive statistics were used to calculate the
frequency of each independent and non-independent activity and
reasons to collect children at school.

2.4. Results

2.4.1. Psychosocial factors that affect CIM
2.4.1.1. Parental fears regarding children’s safety: traf<U+FB01>c and social
danger. In Table 2, <U+FB01>ndings about main reasons for parents to col-
lect children at school are summarized. According to our results,
traf<U+FB01>c danger is the most representative concern in all three envi-
ronments (51.6% in the highly-urbanized, 62.2% in the moder-
ately-urbanized and 66.4% in the non-urbanized). These values
are consistent with other <U+FB01>ndings, in the present study, showing
a signi<U+FB01>cant effect of the risk of a child being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c acci-
dent when crossing a road on the parental level of concern accord-
ing to the urbanization condition [F(2, 523) = 4.876, p = .008]. Post
hoc tests indicated that parents from the highly-urbanized environ-
ment are less concerned about traf<U+FB01>c than parents from the moder-
ately-urbanized one. The second most cited cause of concern by
parents in the highly and moderately settings is danger from adults,
with values of 49.3% and 46.8%, accordingly, whereas only 34.3% of
parents in non-urban area refer to it. Concerning parental level of
agreement about the presence of some young people and adults
in the neighbourhood that make them afraid to let their children
play outdoors, signi<U+FB01>cant differences were found according to the
type of environment [F(2, 505) = 6.012, p = .003]. Post hoc tests
indicated that parents in the three environments do not perceive
young people and adults in their neighborhood as a threat for their
children’s safety while they are playing outdoors. Speci<U+FB01>cally, par-
ents from the non-urbanized environment are more con<U+FB01>dent that
young people and adults in their neighborhood do not pose a threat
to their children’s outdoor safety than parents from the highly-
urbanized setting. The in<U+FB02>uences of gender in parental fears regard-
ing traf<U+FB01>c and social danger were only relevant in the highly
urbanized environment, where danger from adults was the most
representative reason for parents to pick their daughters up from
school. In all other cases, traf<U+FB01>c was always the main parental con-
cern. Danger from adults was pointed out as relevant by more par-
ents of girls (56.7%) than of boys (42.1%) (v2(1) = 4.468, p = .035) in
the highly urbanized setting.
2.4.1.2. Perception on sense of community. A signi<U+FB01>cant effect
regarding parental level of agreement about most adults in the
neighborhood looking out for other people’s children was found
for the three conditions [F(2, 518) = 5.346, p = .005]. Post hoc tests
indicated that parents from the highly and moderately urbanized
environments tend not to trust that other adults in the neighbor-
hood supervise other people’s children, when compared to parents
from the non-urbanized environment that are more convinced
about other adults capabilities to supervise their children. No
gender differences were found for this variable.

2.4.2. CIM and degree of urbanization
2.4.2.1. Children’s age for independent active travel. There was a sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant effect of the age for children to travel on their own accord-
ing to the type of environment [F(2, 527) = 5.56, p = .004]. Post hoc
tests indicated that the mean ages were signi<U+FB01>cantly different for

This variable was computed by merging the variables that inform about the type of accompaniment to and from school (‘‘goes independently (1)/goes with parent (0)’’)

among the three settings but with a different trend than the other
licenses, since this one is more prevalent in the highly-urban set-
ting (88.2% in the highly-urban, 62.1% in the moderately urban
and 50% in the non-urban).

2.4.2.3. Actual mobility in the home-school trajectory. As regards to
children’s actual mobility when going to school and coming back
home, see Fig. 2. We found signi<U+FB01>cant differences in children’s
independent and active travel from home to school between the
three environments, both in primary (v2(2) = 18.703, p < .001)
and in secondary (v2(2) = 6.551, p = .038) school children. Concern-
ing the primary children, the highest percentage of independent
and active travelers occurs in the moderately-urbanized setting
(22.6%). In the secondary children, the non-urban typology counts
with the greatest percentage of independent and active mode of
travel (43.6%). In terms of gender, and only for secondary school
children in the highly urbanized area, signi<U+FB01>cant differences were
found between the percentage of boys (41.5%) and girls (22.2%)
that go to school independently and actively (v2(1) = 4.590,
p = .032). Signi<U+FB01>cant differences were also revealed in the analysis
of the school-home trajectory in terms of independent active tra-
vel. For the primary group (v2(2) = 17.031, p < .001), more children
from the moderately-urban environment were independent and
active on their way back home (27.4%). In terms of gender, and
only for primary school children in the moderately urbanized area,
signi<U+FB01>cant differences were found between the percentage of boys
(38.9%) and girls (19.4%) that go to school independently and
actively (v2(1) = 5.619, p = .018). As regards to the secondary

those from the moderately and non urbanized environments,

(v2(2) = 10.380, p = .006).

2.4.2.4. Actual mobility in weekend leisure time activities. Consider-
ing the mean number of independent activities, children from
the highly-urbanized environment were involved in 2 independent
activities (M = 1.83, SD = 2.13, Median = 1, range 0–12), whereas
children from the moderately and non-urban environments took
part in 3 independent activities (M = 2.57, SD = 2.37, Median = 2,
range 0–12 and M = 2.63, SD = 2.71, Median = 2, range 0–12,
respectively). The differences between settings were signi<U+FB01>cant
[F(2, 549) = 7.579, p = .001]. Differences between gender were
observed in the number of independent activities done by girls
and boys of the moderately urbanized environment (t(160) =
3.385, p = .001) and of the non-urbanized environment
(t(120) = 2.314, p = .022). In both environments, girls participated
in about 2 non-accompanied activities during the weekend (mod-
erately urbanized: M = 2.02, SD = 2.09; non-urbanized: M = 2.13,
SD = 2.32), whereas boys participate in about 3 (moderately urban-
ized: M = 3.18, SD = 2.52; non-urbanized: M = 3.20, SD = 3.01).
With regards to mean number of non-independent activities,
thus, accompanied journeys (with a parent or another adult) to lei-
sure activities, our results are also signi<U+FB01>cant [F(2, 549) = 11.823,
p < .001]. The highest number of non-independent activities is 4
and belongs to children from the moderately-urban setting
(M = 4.10, SD = 3.41, Median = 3, range 0–12), followed by 3
non-independent activities for children from the highly-urban
group (M = 3.09, SD = 2.98, Median = 2, range 0–12) and from the

non-urban environment (M = 2.73, SD = 2.48, Median = 2, range
0–12). Non-urbanized area congregates the least number of non-
independent activities. This result is not surprising if we consider
previous <U+FB01>ndings on mean number of independent activities. No
gender differences were found in the number of non-independent
activities for any of the settings. The percentages of independent
and non-independent activities done by children in each environ-
ment are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. Each value cor-
responds to the percentage of children that took part in a certain
activity, within each study group. Children were free to choose
more than one option and could report to have done the same
activity both independently or accompanied by adults.

2.5. Discussion

2.5.1. Environmental and psychosocial factors that affect CIM
In terms of parental concerns regarding children’s safety, our
results show that fear of traf<U+FB01>c is the most prominent one in all
three environments. In the non-urbanized setting more parents
are concerned about this than in the other two settings. One possi-
ble reason to explain this is that children in the non-urbanized
areas may be less exposed to traf<U+FB01>c circulation than the other chil-
dren. Consequently, their parents may look at them as less compe-
tent to deal with traf<U+FB01>c issues, what might increase the percentage
of parents of this group who feel this type of concern. In relation to
the risk of children being injured in a traf<U+FB01>c accident when crossing
the road, our <U+FB01>ndings reinforce the former, showing that parents
are strongly concerned about it. In terms of traf<U+FB01>c concern and
degree of urbanization, our <U+FB01>ndings show that this type of parental
concern becomes more frequent as the urbanization degree of the
environment decreases. This is consistent with Tillberg Mattsson
(2002), who found that Swedish parents in the countryside envi-
ronment are more worried about traf<U+FB01>c as a threat for children’s
safety when they are outdoors than parents from the town envi-
ronment. Conversely, Shaw et al. (2012), using the same methodol-
ogy adopted in the present study, found that parents from a rural
village in England are less concerned about children being at risk
due to traf<U+FB01>c danger than parents from the inner-city area. More-
over, Johansson (2006), based on a model of Human–Environment
Interaction, concluded that attitudes towards driving children to
places are based on parents’ perceptions of environmental factors,
namely, traf<U+FB01>c danger. Stranger danger was found to be a signi<U+FB01>-
cant cause of concern amongst the three types of environment.
Our results show that frequency of perception of danger from

adults accompanies the decrease of urbanization degree. As to
the gender differences related with danger from adults, our most
interesting result is found in the highly urbanized environment.
In this setting, stranger danger is more referred by girls’ parents
than by boys’ as cause of concern when children are out by them-
selves. However, overall we found that parents are not afraid to let
their children play outdoors because of the presence of other peo-
ple in their neighborhood; and, speci<U+FB01>cally, parents from the non-
urbanized environment are more at ease with the presence of
other people in their neighborhood than parents from the highly-
urbanized setting. These results about parental perception of social
danger are consistent with those found by Prezza et al. (2005) in
Italy revealing that perception of social danger was higher in moth-
ers who live in larger urban contexts and who have more personal
fear of crime and a lower sense of community. Also, our <U+FB01>ndings
concur to those of many other studies referring that perception
of stranger danger and traf<U+FB01>c related concerns are alleged by par-
ents as inhibitors for children’s independent and/or active com-
muting to school (Björklid, 2004; Davison et al., 2008; Lam and
Loo, 2013). With regard to parental perception on sense of commu-
nity, Prezza et al. (2001) argue that stronger neighborhood rela-
tions, together with sense of belonging and of community enable
more shared control and surveillance for children and help parents
to perceive neighborhood as a safe place for their children to move
about freely.
Our most relevant <U+FB01>nding is that parents from more urban envi-
ronments do not perceive a mutual surveillance network that gives
security to children when they are out by themselves in their
neighborhood. Furthermore, this may suggest that sense of com-
munity decreases with increase of urbanization degree. This con-
curs with other studies that have reported stronger sense of
community in rural and small town areas than in typologies with
a greater degree of urbanization (Obst et al., 2002; Roussi et al.,
2006). However, other studies have shown the opposite, revealing
that in places with a high degree of urbanization, the sense of com-
munity is greater that in less urbanized contexts (Prezza et al.,
2009).

2.5.2. CIM and degree of urbanization
Children’s mean age for independent active travel was found to
diminish with the decrease of urbanization (13, 12 and 11 in the
highly, moderately and non urbanized environments, respectively).
The highly and moderately urbanized results are consistent with
some <U+FB01>ndings of a recent research conducted in the state of

mobility licenses. Also, a more recent study conducted by Carver
and colleagues did not reveal any gender differences in the mobil-
ity licenses of primary school children in England and Australia
(Carver et al., 2013).
Moreover, present scores of children’s mobility licenses corrobo-
rate <U+FB01>ndings from a study conducted in Portugal, where areal char-
acteristics were found to signi<U+FB01>cantly in<U+FB02>uence parental granting of
these licenses (Cordovil et al., in press). Not surprisingly, indepen-
dent active travel was found to increase with age. Such <U+FB01>nding rein-
forces Carver et al. (2013) results in urban and rural areas of England,
and is consistent with evidence shown in the program ‘‘We go to
school alone’’ (Prezza et al., 2010). However, Carver et al. (2012)
found that older boys from rural environment show signi<U+FB01>cantly
lower levels of independent and active commuting to and from
school than younger ones. In both primary and secondary children
in all three environments, coming home from school is when chil-
dren are more active and independent. A possible reason for this
might be due to parents’ lack of time to pick children up at the end
of the school day as a result of work commitments. In one hand, such
<U+FB01>nding concurs with Shaw et al. (2012) regarding English secondary

school children’s mode of travel from school to home; in the other

hand, Björklid and Gummesson (2013) did not <U+FB01>nd any signi<U+FB01>cant

differences in children’s answers regarding accompaniment to and

from school. For the secondary school children, independent and

active travel from school to home drops as the degree of urbaniza-

tion increases. This is different from the results of a review on chil-

dren’s active commuting to school stating that children from the

urban milieu are more likely to walk or cycle to school than children

from rural environments (Davison et al., 2008). Concerning actual

mobility during weekend leisure activities, our <U+FB01>ndings show that

the mean number of non-independent activities is higher than the

mean number of independent activities in the three environments.

Mean number of independent activities was quite low (between 2

and 3). Moreover, a decrease of urbanization degree corresponds

to an increase in the mean number of this type of activities. This

result contrasts with Tillberg Mattsson (2002), who found children’s

independent travel to leisure activities to be higher in more urban-

ized type of milieu. Also, Kyttä (1997) did not <U+FB01>nd any signi<U+FB01>cant dif-

ferences among rural, small town and city environments, in the

proportions of children’s independent journeys to outdoor activities.

In the present study, moderately-urbanized environment afforded

highest participation of children in independent leisure time activi-

ties. This <U+FB01>nding is coherent with Kyttä et al. (2012), who concluded

that moderate urban density offers very high possibilities for chil-

dren’s independent use of it, promoting active behavioral patterns

and access to meaningful places. According to our results, the most

common independent activities accessed by children were going

to a friend’s house; going for a walk or cycling around; and playing

sports or swimming. All of these values were registered in the mod-

erately urbanized setting. These activities are somewhat consistent

with those found by Björklid and Gummesson (2013), namely ‘‘going

to a friend’s home’’ which was, in both cases, the most common

activity. As to non-independent activities, the majority of the maxi-

mum values were also concentrated in the moderately-urbanized

setting, namely, going to shops; visiting relatives or grown-ups

and going to the cinema. Based on our <U+FB01>ndings, when on their own

or with the company of peers, children report accessing leisure

activities where they can be more physically active (i.e., sports,

walking, cycling), whereas in the company of adults they engage

in more sedentary activities (like shopping), probably dictated by

the adults’ own convenience and needs. Regarding the effect of gen-
der on the actual mobility in the home-school trajectory, in the
highly and moderately urbanized settings more boys than girls tra-
vel to school independently and actively. However, these differences
are only found in the secondary group of children for the highly
urbanized setting and in the primary group for the moderately
of Transport Geography 41 (2014) 210–219                                        217
urbanized setting. During weekend leisure time activities, boys from
the moderately and non urbanized environments, engage in a higher
number of independent activities than girls. Overall, these gender
differences in terms of actual mobility are similar to the <U+FB01>ndings
of Fyhri and Hjorthol (2009) who showed that boys have a higher
mobility index than girls when going to school and to leisure
activities.
Although this study is noteworthy of the impact of urbanization
in children’s independent mobility, it also has some limitations.
The type of questions of the survey, which focused speci<U+FB01>cally on
actual mobility in the home-school journey and during weekend
leisure time activities, are speci<U+FB01>c to the day the questionnaire
was <U+FB01>lled and to the previous weekend, respectively. This fact
could present some bias in terms of the representativeness of the
usual daily and weekend mobility. Moreover, complementary
qualitative research should be conducted, in order to gain a more
in-depth grasp about the links between children’s independent
mobility and degree of urbanization.


2.5.3. A need for a change of CIM in the highly urbanized environment:

from a motorized city to a walkable one

In the highly-urbanized environment, our <U+FB01>ndings show that

children’s mean age for independent active travel is 13 years old,

the highest from the three settings. Regarding mobility licenses,

we found that the lowest percentage of secondary school children

allowed to independently go out after dark, cycle on main roads

and go to places other than school occurs in the city setting; as to

primary school children, the minimum percentage allowed to inde-

pendently cross main roads and cycle on them, and to go to places

other than school takes place in the former setting. In terms of

actual mobility, the smallest value of secondary school children that

return home from school actively and independently occurs in the

highly-urbanized group, as well as the least mean number of inde-

pendent leisure time activities. Moreover, the city environment reg-

istered highest level of parental concern regarding strange danger;

strong concern regarding traf<U+FB01>c; and lowest parental sense of com-

munity. These results show that CIM in the city of Lisbon is quite

restricted, meaning that this conspicuous highly-urbanized envi-

ronment does not seem to gather enough requirements and oppor-

tunities for children’s and young people’s independent movement

and autonomous environmental experiences. Simultaneously, it is

very relevant the fact that in the Great Lisbon, 20.5% of its popula-

tion is composed of children and young people, aged between 0

and 14 years old (Pordata and Statistics Portugal, 2011). Therefore,

such city’s unfriendliness towards children’s independent and

active movement should be a topic of major concern. Churchman

(2003) recommends that cities and neighborhoods should physi-

cally and socially provide opportunities for children’s independent

travel, play and use of public space. Additionally, Burdette and

Whitaker (2005) and Mainella et al. (2011) call the attention for

the need to reinstall free outdoor play back into children’s lives

due to its therapeutic value in terms of child development, well-

being and happiness. Moreover, Weston (2010) claims that the pri-

mary reason cities should designed for young people (11–15 years

old) to independently travel within them is because the area of

the brain related to spatial perception and analysis is developing

in this period of time and freedom of movement is determinant

for such development to occur. Therefore, it is our opinion that

changing the city’s paradigm of child mobility from driving to walk-

ing should become a public health goal.


3. Concluding remarks

In this study we have shown that an increase of urbaniza-
tion degree leads to a general decrease of children’s independent

218                                                       F. Lopes et al. / Journal of Transport
mobility. Gender did not in<U+FB02>uence the independent mobility

licenses. Nevertheless, boys have higher levels of actual mobility

than girls. Parental perception of stranger danger is more frequent
in parents from the city environment as well as a lower sense of
community. We have also shown that parental fears regarding traf-

<U+FB01>c and stranger danger are the most frequent among the three
environments with different degree of urbanization. According to
our results, children from the city environment are those whose

quest for independence and autonomy is more at risk. We believe
that children’s daily chauffeuring and escorting in public space, as
a result of a pervasive motorized culture and of cultural speci<U+FB01>c

factors, strongly contribute for this decrease of CIM. In this way,
instead of exploring the city environment at their own pace and
freedom, actively moving from place to place, children are sight-

seeing the territory in the back seat of automobiles. Their vision
of the environment is a motorized one where meaningful places
are isolated islands, excluded from each other. Furthermore, chil-

dren’s bodies are being excluded from freedom of movement and

their interactions with the physical environment are severely
restricted. Consequently, children’s autonomy, health and develop-
ment are at risk. Hence, in order to reverse this body-space alien-

ation and concomitantly rescue both children’s and the city’s well-
being, a shift from a motorized city to a walkable one is not only
advisable, as it is desperately needed.
