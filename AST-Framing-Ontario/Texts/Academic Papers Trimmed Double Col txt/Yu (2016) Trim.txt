                                         This study explores the impacts of school siting and surrounding built environments on rates of motorist and pedestrian
                                         crashes around public schools in the Austin Independent School District, Texas, by using log-linear regressions. The results
                                         show that a higher sidewalk coverage and a higher percentage of local roads reduce pedestrian crashes around schools,
                                         while higher percentages of highways and commercial uses and higher transit stop densities increase motorist and pedestrian
                                         crashes. It is desirable to locate schools in areas with higher percentages of local roads and lower percentages of highways
                                         and commercial uses.
