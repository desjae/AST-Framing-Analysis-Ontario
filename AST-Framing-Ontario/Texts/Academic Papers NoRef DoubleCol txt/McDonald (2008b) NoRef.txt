Abstract
This study evaluates how household interactions a<U+FB00>ect walking and biking to school. The cross-sectional research design uses a rep-
resentative sample of trips to school by US youth (n = 8231) to test how parental employment status and commute patterns a<U+FB00>ect non-
motorized travel. Results from a binary logit model show that young children (5–14) with mothers who commute to work in the morning
are less likely to walk or bike to school after controlling for individual, household, and neighborhood factors. Policymakers may there-
fore want to create programs that allow parents to share chaperoning responsibilities for the school trip to address parental time
constraints.

2. Children’s travel

Rates of walking to school vary widely across the globe.
Less than 15% of US schoolchildren walked or biked to
school in 2001 (Martin and Carlson, 2005). This compares
with a walking rate of approximately 50% for British chil-
dren in 1999–2001 and 27% of children in Melbourne, Aus-
tralia in 1993–1996 (Ampt, 1996; Pooley et al., 2005). There
have been well-documented declines in walking to school in
the United States and the United Kingdom in recent dec-
ades (McDonald, 2007; Pooley et al., 2005).
Part of the decline in walking to school may be related
to an overall decrease in children’s independent spatial
mobility. In their seminal study, Hillman et al. (1990)
showed that English schoolchildren had less travel freedom
in 1990 than in 1971. In 1970, 94% of 10 and 11 year old
British children were allowed to walk to school unaccom-
panied by an adult (Hillman et al., 1990). By 1990 the num-
ber was 54% and in 1998 the number was 47% (O’Brien
et al., 2000). This suggests that parents are changing their
de<U+FB01>nition of when it is safe to let a child walk to school
unaccompanied.
Other studies have also found a decline in independent
travel, but have shown that context moderates the e<U+FB00>ects.
O’Brien et al. (2000) found that children’s freedom was
higher in a lower-density new town than London. Simi-
larly, Kytta (1997) showed that Finnish children in rural
areas had more travel freedom than peers in a city and
small town.
This decrease in travel freedom may be associated with
parental concerns about tra<U+FB03>c dangers and the risk of
abduction or harassment (Beuret and Camara, 1998; diGi-
useppi et al., 1998; Martin and Carlson, 2005; Surface
Transportation Policy Project, Transportation and Land
Use Coalition, & Latino Issue Forum, 2003; Tranter,
1996). Parents of younger children (5–11 years) may be
most concerned with these issues. For example, over 40%
of the parents of primary school-aged children reported
that their children faced tra<U+FB03>c obstacles; closer to 30% of
parents of older children listed this as a barrier (Dellinger,
2002). Geographers have noted that safety concerns have
led parents to limit the time children spend playing in pub-
lic spaces, and the safety-imposed restrictions are more
severe for girls than boys (Valentine, 1997b).
Walking rates for children are also a<U+FB00>ected by individ-
ual-level factors, particularly age and sex. Girls are less
likely to walk than boys are with the di<U+FB00>erences being most
prominent at younger ages (Evenson et al., 2003; McMillan
et al., 2006; O’Brien et al., 2000) and in suburban areas
(Vliet, 1983). Household factors such as car ownership
a<U+FB00>ect mode choice (Bradshaw and Atkins, 1996; diGi-
useppi et al., 1998). The built environment appears to exert
a small, but signi<U+FB01>cant, e<U+FB00>ect on walking to school. In a
study of Oregon middle schools, Schlossberg et al. (2006)
found that urban form – as measured by higher intersection
densities and lower proportions of dead-ends – was associ-
ated with walking to school. McMillan’s (2007) study of
Transport Geography 16 (2008) 324–331                             325
California elementary students found a modest relationship
between urban form and walking. Boarnet et al. (2005) and
Staunton et al. (2003) have shown that changes in the built
environment, such as sidewalk and street crossing improve-
ments, can make students more likely to walk to school.
Analyses of walking by youths aged 5–18 in the Atlanta
region found that the e<U+FB00>ect of urban form factors such as
intersection density, residential density, and mixed land
uses on walking was moderated by household vehicle
access and income (Kerr et al., 2007). In that study, youth
from families with more vehicle access and higher incomes
exhibited stronger associations between walking and urban
form.

2.1. Household interactions

Analyses of travel suggest the presence of children has a
strong e<U+FB00>ect on adult travel patterns. Jones (1979) showed
that a small change in school starting time a<U+FB00>ected the tra-
vel patterns of every household member. Rosenbloom
(1987) found that the presence of children had a stronger
e<U+FB00>ect on maternal, as opposed to paternal, travel behavior.
More recently, modelers have attempted to use household
interactions to predict activity scheduling and tripmaking
(see Transportation 32(5) for a review of current intra-
household modeling e<U+FB00>orts). Travel models that incorpo-
rate household interactions have shown that the presence
of children a<U+FB00>ects adult activity and travel scheduling (Gli-
ebe and Koppelman, 2005). While this research con<U+FB01>rms
that household interactions are important to understand-
ing travel behavior, the computational intensity of the
models has often led to a focus on adult behavior or a lim-
ited set of activities.
An exception to this is the work of Vovsha and Petersen
(2005) and Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2007). Using data
from Atlanta, Vovsha and Petersen (2005) found that
40% of children are escorted on the way to school and
35% on the way home and household females were most
likely to escort children. They found that having a school
within walking distance did not reduce demand for escort-
ing in the morning (although it did in the afternoon). How-
ever, their analysis only considered automobile trips.
Yarlagadda and Srinivasan (2007), in a sample of San
Francisco Bay Area households, found that mothers trav-
eling to work were less likely to walk their children to
school and more likely to drive them. The travel behavior
of fathers had less in<U+FB02>uence.

3. Methodology

3.1. Design and sample

This study uses a cross-sectional research design to
explore the importance of household interactions on chil-
dren’s school travel. Chi-square tests and binary logit mod-
els identify the role of household interactions in rates of
walking and biking to school for a national sample of

326                                N.C. McDonald / Journal of
US youth. Data for the analysis come from the National
Household Travel Survey (NHTS), a population-based,
random-digit dial phone and mail survey which captures
information on all trips undertaken by household members
on a designated survey day as well as socio-demographic
information (for complete details of survey design see the
NHTS User’s Guide (US Department of Transportation,
2004)). The survey, which was collected by contractors to
the US Department of Transportation between March
2001 and May 2002, gathered information on 66,000
households in the United States and had a weighted
person-level response rate of 34.1%. This analysis focuses
on 8231 children between the ages of 5 and 18 who traveled
between home and school on the morning of the survey day
and for whom complete household socio-demographic
information including number of vehicles owned, house-
hold size and composition, and household income are
available.

3.2. Measures

The primary unit of analysis is the child’s trip tour
between home and school. School destinations were deter-
mined by a trip purpose of ‘‘go to school as a student.” For
each child, we compiled information on their trip to school,
household demographics, and neighborhood characteris-
tics. If the survey recorded multiple tours between home
and school for a child, only the <U+FB01>rst tour was used in the
analysis.

3.2.1. Trip characteristics
Following Cervero and Duncan (2003), distance
between home and school is the primary measure of the
trip. In the 2001 NHTS, distances were self-reported in
either blocks or miles. Following Agrawal and Schimek
(2007) who showed that the standard NHTS coding of
short trip distances is inaccurate because many trips of less
than a half mile are coded as ‘‘0 miles”, I recoded any trip
reported as ‘‘0 blocks” to 0.055 miles (based on the NHTS’
assumption that a block is 1/9 of a mile) and recoded trips
reported as ‘‘0 miles” to 0.25 miles (using the midpoint of
the interval from 0 to 0.5 miles). For cases where students
made intermediate stops between home and school, trip
distance was calculated as the sum of the distance for each
unlinked trip between home and school.

3.2.2. Individual, household, and neighborhood
characteristics
The child’s age and sex were the primary measures of
individual characteristics. In the NHTS, only the race of
the <U+FB01>rst household respondent – often the mother or father
– is recorded. Therefore race and ethnicity were measured
at the household level. Information on household income
and number of vehicles per licensed driver were also
extracted from demographic questions. The DOT con-
tracted with Claritas, Inc. to add a measure of residential
density at the block group level. Because this was a
Transport Geography 16 (2008) 324–331
national survey, it was impossible to obtain richer mea-
sures of local land use.

3.2.3. Household interactions
The NHTS gathers information on relationships among
all household respondents making it possible to identify
mothers and fathers (or primary guardians) for each child.
Trip records also indicate which family members were on
the trip and whether any non-household members accom-
panied the child. For de<U+FB01>nitional purposes, children riding
the school bus were classi<U+FB01>ed as traveling with non-house-
hold members.
Information on mother and fathers’ work status, occu-
pation, education, and distance to work were incorporated
into the children’s travel records. Data on parents’ travel
mode to work and time departing for work on survey
day were also included using two dummy variables for each
parent: mother/father travels to work in am and mother/
father travels to work in pm (reference category: mother/
father not in paid labor force). Mother/father travel to
work in am equated to the parent traveling to work before
10 am on the survey day. Data on siblings, including the
number of siblings, and ages of oldest and youngest sibling,
were also calculated and included in the <U+FB01>nal dataset.

3.3. Analysis

Chi-square analyses were used to examine the relation-
ship between travel mode to school, travel companions
for the school trip and mother’s work status. Binary logit
models of children’s non-motorized school travel (de<U+FB01>ned
as walking or biking) were also computed to more directly
control for individual, household and neighborhood-level
covariates. Variables were included in the <U+FB01>nal model if
they were signi<U+FB01>cant at the 90% level or if there was a
strong theoretical reason for keeping them in the model.
Separate models were estimated for elementary and middle
school students (ages 5–14) and high school students (ages
15–18) due to expected behavioral di<U+FB00>erences (Evenson
et al., 2003; Hillman et al., 1990). Person-level sample
weights supplied by the DOT were applied to account for
the strati<U+FB01>ed survey sampling design.
For the binary logit models, only students living within
3 miles of their school (representing 93% of walking and
99% of biking trips to school) were included in the analysis.
This criteria, which follows Cervero and Duncan’s (2003)
approach in studying adult walking behavior, ensured only
trips which could reasonably be completed by walking or
biking were studied. In addition, only children from two-
parent households were considered in the binary logit mod-
els in order to assess the di<U+FB00>erential impact of mothers and
fathers on children’s active school travel. These restrictions
reduced the sample size to 4059 students from 2579 house-
holds. The presence of siblings in the sample required the
use of robust coe<U+FB03>cient standard errors to account for cor-
relations in behavior between children from the same
household.

3.3.1. Interpreting model results

Coe<U+FB03>cients from logit models tend to be uninformative
at face value; therefore odds ratios, marginal e<U+FB00>ects, and


predicted probabilities are presented. The odds ratio repre-
sents how much a 1 unit change in the independent variable
will a<U+FB00>ect the likelihood of walking or biking versus not
walking or biking. Marginal e<U+FB00>ects represent the e<U+FB00>ect of
a 1 unit change in the independent variable on the proba-
bility of walking or biking (Ben-Akiva and Lerman,

1985). This study reports the average marginal e<U+FB00>ect by
computing e<U+FB00>ects for each variable at the individual-level
and then averaging over the sample. Several authors have
shown this is preferable to computing the e<U+FB00>ects on the
‘average individual’ because of the non-linear shape of
the probability curve (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985; Train,
2003). The predicted probability of walking for certain
variables of interest, e.g., parental work status, are also
presented to give a sense of the absolute e<U+FB00>ects.

4. Results

The students in this sample make 55% of their trips to
school via the private automobile; school buses are the
other dominant mode, accounting for 31% of trips. Walk-
ing accounts for 12.5% of trips; biking represents 0.8%.
Modal patterns vary substantially across the country
(Fig. 1). Walking rates are highest in the western United
States with the Paci<U+FB01>c and Mountain census divisions hav-
ing 18% of students walking to school. The lowest rates of
walking, 1%, were reported in the East South Central divi-
sion that includes Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ten-
nessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Data on travel companions reveal that students make
11% of school trips by themselves. Within the household,
mothers are most likely to be the child’s travel companion
(30%) and are very likely to drive children to school.
Fathers (11%) and siblings (6%) are also important travel
companions. Children make a large portion of trips

(40%) with non-household members, generally on the
school bus.
The importance of household interactions in mode
choice for school trips is strongly moderated by the child’s
age (Fig. 2). Until children reach driving age, they rely
heavily on their mothers. These <U+FB01>ndings con<U+FB01>rm results
from earlier studies that showed that mothers had primary
responsibility for children’s travel (Rosenbloom, 1987;
Rosenbloom and Burns, 1993). Once students reach driv-
ing age, they are much more likely to travel by themselves
because they have access to automobiles but also because
they have permission to travel further on their own (Hill-
man et al., 1990; Valentine, 1997b). The proportion of trips
made with fathers does not vary strongly with age again
showing the di<U+FB00>erences in paternal and maternal travel
behavior.
Combining children’s travel mode with companionship
information shows that mothers drive 27% of children to
school; this is second only to the school bus in mode/com-
panionship share (Table 1). Table 1 also reveals that
mother’s work status strongly in<U+FB02>uences whether children
