reported results from the primary studies and based on a random e<U+FB00>ect model. The results show that four BE
factors (dead-end street, % of residential land, % of commercial land, and residential location type) have a
positive association with CIM; tra<U+FB03>c volume has a neutral association; and the remaining eight factors
(vehicular street width, road density, intersection density, major road proportion, land use mix, availability of
recreational facilities, residential density, and distance to destination) have a negative association. Living in
dead end street was found to have the strongest positive ES (0.352), with moderate level of consistency across
the primary studies. In contrast, land use mix has the strongest negative ES (-0.212) but with the highest level
of inconsistency. Both ESs and consistencies, however, vary between developing and developed country
contexts. Diversity in contexts, research design, and measurement instruments across the primary studies
contributed to the heterogeneous results. The <U+FB01>ndings of this research serve as a guide for practitioners and
researcher alike to make an informed decision about the BE factors that consistently foster or hinder CIM in
di<U+FB00>erent contexts.

S. Sharmin, Md. Kamruzzaman
Cervero et al. (2009) for a detailed description of the ‘5Ds’ and their
indicators.
Research on the link between BE and CIM has been popularised
recently for two reasons. First, an increasing evidence shows that the
level of CIM dropped signi<U+FB01>cantly over the last few decades. This
decline led to childhood obesity (Whitzman et al., 2010); sense of
loneliness and fear (Prezza and Pacilli, 2007); physical (Rushovich
et al., 2006), social (Groves, 1997), and cognitive (Christensen and
O'Brien, 2003) incompetencies; poor environmental knowledge
(Rissotto and Tonucci, 2002); reduced social and recreational opportu-
nities (Prezza et al., 2001); and car dependency (Lopes et al., 2014;
Mackett, 2002). For example, in Australia, the overall proportion of
unaccompanied children travelling to school had dropped from 61% to
32% from 1991 to 2012, arguably this <U+FB01>gure may vary between
di<U+FB00>erent geographical contexts in Australia (Schoeppe et al., 2015).
In contrast, the number of children with obesity increased from 21% to
26% between 1995 and 2012 (ANPHA, Australian National Preventive
Health Agency, 2014). Second, the topic attracts research attention
from multiple research disciplines (public health, urban planning, and
psychology) due to its multiple policy bene<U+FB01>ts as outlined above.
Built environmental and socio-cultural transformations caused by
growing pressure of urbanization are on the rise and are argued to have
altered children's mobility pattern worldwide (Fyhri et al., 2011; Lopes
et al., 2014; Malone and Rudner, 2011; Tranter and Sharpe, 2012).
Consequently, research on the complex relationship between BE and
CIM has increased since the <U+FB01>rst reported study in the early 1980s by
Van Vliet (1983). These studies have investigated a range of built
environment factors (e.g. availability and proximity of destinations,
land use diversity and density, street connectivity) and assessed their
impacts on CIM to inform policies (De Meester et al., 2014; Kyttä, 2004;
Loebach and Gilliland, 2014; Monsur and Islam, 2011; Prezza et al.,
2001; Villanueva et al., 2012a; Villanueva et al., 2012b; Villanueva
et al., 2013).
Among the various studies, only a few of them have reported a
consistent relationship between several BE factors and CIM. Despite
their consistency (in terms of direction), the strength of association,
however, varies substantially among the studies. For example, Broberg
and Sarjala (2015) have reported that a strong negative correlation
exists between CIM and land use mix in Finland, whereas the relation-
ship was found to be moderately negative in Bangladesh (Islam et al.,
2014). A number of studies have, however, identi<U+FB01>ed that such a
correlation does not exist at all - i.e. land use mix has no impact on boy's
IM (Carver et al., 2014b). Further adding to this complexity, an
opposite relationship has also been reported in the literature for several
BE factors. For example, most studies have reported that a positive
association exists between well-connected street networks and CIM
(Braza et al., 2004; Kerr et al., 2006). Monsur and Islam (2011), in
contrast, found that less-connected road networks (e.g. dead end
streets) are more likely to increase CIM. These contradictions and
ambiguity in research <U+FB01>ndings raise the question about the true e<U+FB00>ect of
the BE on CIM; and despite decades-long exploration on this topic, there
is clearly a dearth of studies that systematically and statistically
investigated these inconsistencies.
Previously, four studies have conducted a systematic review of the
CIM literature (Bates and Stone, 2015; Malone and Rudner, 2017;
Moghtaderi et al., 2012; Schoeppe et al., 2013). These studies have
mainly focused on the link between CIM and health bene<U+FB01>ts. This
means that CIM has been used as an explanatory factor of health
outcomes. However, Malone and Rudner (2017) have provided a
descriptive summary of CIM in relation to di<U+FB00>erent socio-cultural and
ecological contexts. This current study draws on the relationship
between BE factors and CIM measured by systematically reviewing
e<U+FB00>ects of the former on the latter, considering cultural and geographic
determinants, which may a<U+FB00>ect the expression of both variables. In
particular, this research aims to answer the following four research
questions: a) What are the di<U+FB00>erent BE factors that signi<U+FB01>cantly a<U+FB00>ect

CIM?; b) What are the magnitudes and directions of the associations?;
c) Which BE factors have more consistent relationships with CIM?; and
d) What are the plausible causes of variations of the reported results in
prior studies?
The paper employs a meta-analysis technique to answer the above
research questions. A meta-analysis is a form of a structured review of
the literature on a particular topic of interest. Previously, researchers
have used a range of review techniques which can broadly be
categorised as traditional or narrative literature review and systematic
literature review. A detailed description of these methods is outlined in
Jesson et al. (2011). Brie<U+FB02>y, a narrative review examines a body of the
literature and draws a conclusion about a topic in question. It aims to
provide the readers with a comprehensive background for understand-
ing existing knowledge and thereby to identify gaps for new research. In
contrast, a systemic review uses more rigorous and well-de<U+FB01>ned criteria
to select and review the literature to answer a well-developed research
question in order to allow the readers to assess the reliability and
validity of the review (Torgerson, 2003). In addition to meta-analysis,
another form of systematic review includes meta-synthesis. A meta-
analysis is di<U+FB00>erent from a meta-synthesis in that the former is based on
statistical analysis of <U+FB01>ndings reported in previous studies whereas the
latter is a non-statistical technique used to integrate, evaluate and
interpret the <U+FB01>ndings of multiple qualitative research studies
(Borenstein and Wiley, 2009). Therefore, a meta-analysis permits to
extract the strength and direction of associations between dependent
and independent variables, and thereby allows a more objective
assessment of the evidence and may clarify heterogeneity or similarities
(Egger and Smith, 1997).
The objective of this meta-analytic review is to statistically sum-
marize the current body of knowledge on the association between BE
and CIM in an attempt to estimate the average impact of di<U+FB00>erent BE
characteristics on CIM. It <U+FB01>rst combines the e<U+FB00>ect size (ES) of the
studies reporting an association between BE and CIM for general-
izability, and then compares the average e<U+FB00>ect sizes across di<U+FB00>erent
variables to rank their relative strengths and validity. These <U+FB01>ndings
would serve as a policy guide to design urban areas that promote
travelling autonomy for children; ensuring them with greater freedom
to explore their surroundings, which is one of the fundamental premises
for a child-friendly city.

2. Research methods

2.1. Search strategy

An extensive search procedure was employed comprised of six
stages in order to identify relevant studies for meta-analysis. First, a
comprehensive search was performed within all major electronic
databases including Scopus, Tailor & Francis online, BioMed Central
and Science Direct. The search range was speci<U+FB01>ed from January 1980
to May 2016. The 1980 was selected as the starting period because an
initial search result indicated that the <U+FB01>rst study on this topic was
published in 1983 by Van Vliet (1983). Search terms included, but not
limited to, “urban environment”, “built environment”, physical environment
of neighbourhood, neighbourhood character, neighbourhood, land use,
proximity, distance to destination, walkability, street connection, street
network, accessibility in combination with “children's independent mobi-
lity”, or “children's autonomous mobility”, or children's: free movement”, or
children's independent journey”, or “free play”. Second, a selective search
was performed, for the same time period, within the following journal
titles: Health and Place, Transportation Planning and Technology, Environ-
ment and Behaviour, Children's Geographies, Journal of Urban design,
Journal of Transport Geography, Journal of Transport and Health, Trans-
port Policy, and Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport. The initial
research showed that these journals published a majority of studies on
this topic. Third, reference lists of the selected publications from the
above steps were checked in order to identify additional studies not

studies used all four types of CIM indicators: CIM range, CIM time, CIM
license, and CIM Destination (Table 1).
2.5. Coding of studies

This study used a systematic coding scheme and a standard form to
insert data for analysis following a detailed review of the selected
primary studies. In addition to statistical data, various contextual
variables were also coded in order to examine the sources of variations
in the reported results among the primary studies such as sample sizes,
age and gender of the respondents, geographic contexts of the study
(urban, rural, suburban), economic context (e.g. developed or devel-
oping countries), research methodology used (theoretical basis, CIM
dimensions, measurement scale of CIM and BE variables), publication
year, and study design (cross-sectional and longitudinal). E<U+FB00>orts were
made to obtain any missing data through a personal communication
with the corresponding authors via email before eliminating a study
from the analysis. In three primary studies, the reported results were in
di<U+FB00>erent format from what is required for meta-analysis. In these cases,
further calculations were made to convert the reported format of data
into a usable format based on either available information presented
within the studies or the information received via email. In this
research, the meta-analysis was not conducted separately for each of
the CIM dimensions. Rather this study reported an aggregated result.
The intent here is to extract the overall in<U+FB02>uence of the BE variables on
CIM.

2.6. Data analysis strategy

2.6.1. Classi<U+FB01>cation of the reported results of primary studies
The results of the primary studies were classi<U+FB01>ed according to their
reported format. This research found that <U+FB01>ve types of results have been
reported in the selected 12 primary studies. These included: a)
descriptive statistics outlining mean CIM for certain BE factors with
standard deviation (SD); b) Pearson's or spearman's correlational
coe<U+FB03>cient value ‘r’ which describes the magnitude of correlation
between CIM and BE variables c) t statistics with sample sizes when
linear regression models are estimated to describe a link between BE
and CIM; d) odds ratio (OR) with con<U+FB01>dence interval (CI) to determine
the odds of particular event between di<U+FB00>erent types of outcome CIM
and BE variables; and e) z value of statistical signi<U+FB01>cance and sample
sizes. Given that the aim of this study is to derive an overall e<U+FB00>ect size
of the BE factors, these <U+FB01>ve types of studies were standardized into a
common format as outlined below in Section 2.6.2.

2.6.2. Calculation of e<U+FB00>ect size (ES)
The results of the <U+FB01>ve types of studies were converted into a
common ES ‘correlation (r) with 95% con<U+FB01>dence interval (CI). Eq. 1
was used to calculate ES from studies that reported descriptive results:

Journal of Transport Geography 61 (2017) 104–117
r = d v (d 2 + a )                                                            (1)

where, d = standardized mean di<U+FB00>erences, a = correction factor
for cases where n1 <U+2260> n2, [a = (n1 + n2)2/n1n2], and n = sample

sizes.
Eq. 2 was used to convert t statistics into a correlation:

r = v (t 2 t 2 + df )                                                         (2)


where, t is the reported value for the t-test, and df is the degrees of
freedom of the test.
Eq. 3 was used to compute correlation from z value of statistical
signi<U+FB01>cance:

r = v (z 2 n )                                                                (3)

where n is the sample size.
Eqs. 4 and 1 were used to convert odds ratio (OR) into a correlation
using a two-step procedure. First, odds ratios were converted into mean
di<U+FB00>erence (d) by using Eq. 4. Second, the derived mean di<U+FB00>erence was
again converted into a correlation value by using Eq. 1.
d = ( v3 p ) ln(OR )                                                          (4)
All calculations were conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-

2.6.3. Identifying the overall ES of a BE factor
The individual e<U+FB00>ect sizes (ESs) from all primary studies focusing on
a particular BE variable were aggregated in order to derive an overall
ES for that BE variable. This study used a random e<U+FB00>ect model for
aggregation over a <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ect model because a <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ect model
assumes that the true e<U+FB00>ect size is same in all primary studies and the
only reason that the ESs vary between studies is due to sampling error.
Therefore, a <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ect model ignores the possibility that the true
e<U+FB00>ects might be di<U+FB00>erent between studies due to variations in sample
structure (e.g. age, gender, income of the sample). In contrast, a
random-e<U+FB00>ect model allows that the true e<U+FB00>ect could vary from study
to study. For example, the ES might be higher (or lower) in studies
where the participants are relatively older (e.g. 16–18 years compared
to 9–10 years). Consequently, in a <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ect model, a larger weight is
given to the studies that have larger sample sizes because it is assumed
that better ESs are inherent in studies with larger sample sizes (less
prone to sampling error). The random e<U+FB00>ect model takes into account
the ESs of individual studies because each study provides information
about a di<U+FB00>erent ES (i.e. we cannot discount a small study by giving it a
very small weight). Therefore, a random e<U+FB00>ect model delivers more
balanced relative weights where extreme studies lose in<U+FB02>uence if they
are large and gain in<U+FB02>uence if they are small (Card, 2015). The overall
ESs were calculated for 13 di<U+FB00>erent relationships between BE and CIM
in this research. These results were further analysed through series of
meta-analyses to understand the moderating e<U+FB00>ects of gender (girl vs.
boy) and contextual variations (developed vs. developing country).

2.6.4. Determination of heterogeneity among the primary studies
A statistical test of heterogeneity was conducted to assess the
consistencies of the reported results among the primary studies.
Heterogeneity tests checked whether there were genuine di<U+FB00>erences
underlying the results of the studies (heterogeneity), or the variations in
<U+FB01>ndings are compatible with chance (homogeneity). This has been
measured by I2, which indicates the likelihood of total variation due to
heterogeneity rather than homogeneity. I2 was derived based on Eq. 5.

I 2 = 100%x (Q - df ) Q                                                       (5)
where, Q = Cochran's heterogeneity statistics, and df = degree of
freedom.
Prior research has indicated that any values of I2 < 25% are
considered as low heterogeneity, values between 25% and 75% are
considered as moderate heterogeneity, and values above 75% indicate a

category/subgroup or outcome measure is an individual study. Among
the 13 factors, the link between distance to destination and CIM has
been studied most frequently (in 8 primary studies with 20 entries as
shown in Table 4). Other frequently used BE variables are: the
availability of recreational facilities, residential density, land use mix,
intersection density and vehicular street width. According to the data
presented in Table 4, seven of the 13 relationships were examined only
in two primary studies. Although the number of primary studies seems
to be quite small for these factors, the inclusion of multiple entries
overcame the drawback of limited sample sizes in these cases. After the
inclusion of multiple entries, only one factor remained with two entries
(tra<U+FB03>c volume) (Table 4).

country) in order to understand whether the relationships hold between
di<U+FB00>erent contexts (Table 6). Table 6 contains many empty cells which
means that these BE factors were not comparable between developed
and developing country contexts for two reasons: a) all primary studies
were originated from a single context; and b) ES calculation is not
supported when there are fewer than two studies in any of the contexts.
These restrictions allowed a comparison of only four BE variables in this
study.

3.2.1. Strength of association
It is apparent from Table 5 that the BE variable with the strongest
association with CIM falls within the moderate ES range. Of the 13 BE-
CIM associations, six have a value ranging from small to moderate ES.
These included (in order of strength): dead end streets, proportion of
residential use, land use mix, vehicular street width, proportion of
commercial use, and residential location type. The remaining 7 factors
have a very small ES (less than ± 0.1). These are: distance to destina-
tion, residential density, availability of recreation facilities, tra<U+FB03>c
volume, proportion of major road, intersection density, and road
density.
In terms of signi<U+FB01>cance, a majority of the BE factors (7) stand
against null hypothesis “no e<U+FB00>ect of the intervention” and found to

distance to destination, intersection density and road density variables
also appeared to have a higher level of heterogeneity with I2 > 75%.
These high magnitudes of heterogeneity indicate the presence of
genuine di<U+FB00>erences underlying the results of these studies.
BE factors that were identi<U+FB01>ed with an insigni<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect, most of
them possess a higher level of heterogeneity (I2 = 80%) (proportion of
commercial land use, residential density). The overall <U+FB01>ndings, how-
ever, suggest that there is no linear connection between ES and
heterogeneity because a higher level of heterogeneity exists within
both signi<U+FB01>cant and insigni<U+FB01>cant factors.
3.2.4. Sources of variation
Table 5 shows that a high level of heterogeneity exists (I2 = 75%)
for seven BE-CIM relationships. Note that this research used random
e<U+FB00>ect model to take into account the heterogeneity among the primary
studies (Higgins and Green, 2011). Despite this consideration, the
presence of a high level of heterogeneity in these seven associations
implies the evidence of genuine di<U+FB00>erences among the primary studies.
As a result, this research further investigates the plausible causes of this
high level of heterogeneity. Figs. 2-5 show the contextual and metho-
dological di<U+FB00>erences in these factors.
The main issue that can be extracted from these <U+FB01>gures and is
potentially contributing to the variations is the presence of a high
number of subgroups within a study. This is also evident by the
di<U+FB00>erences between the number of studies and the number of entries
used. For example, seven entries were taken from two studies for the
proportion of commercial land use factor. Similarly, 17 entries were
taken from seven studies for the distance to destination factor.
Moreover, a substantial di<U+FB00>erence exists among the entry types. For
example, entries were classi<U+FB01>ed based on: destination choice (Fig. 2:
small, medium, and large parks), transport mode used for independent
mobility (e.g. in Fig. 3: walk vs. cycle), the operational di<U+FB00>erences in
terms of method used to derive BE factors (e.g. in Fig. 4: 1200 m bu<U+FB00>er
vs. 1600 m BE bu<U+FB00>er), and gender di<U+FB00>erences (e.g. in Fig. 5: boys vs.
girls) among others. A major variation also exists in terms of the
indicators used to represent CIM. It appears that most of the BE-CIM
relationships are represented with multiple measures of CIM. The use of

destination on CIM between di<U+FB00>erent subgroups.
all four CIM indicators (CIM time, CIM range, CIM destination, and CIM
license) to measure an association with a particular BE factor is not
uncommon in the literature (Fig. 2). In addition, the sample sizes used
to assess the impact of BE on CIM in primary studies also vary
considerably. For example, the sample sizes range from 109 to 1121
among the primary studies that used land use mix as a BE indicator
(Fig. 5).
The level of heterogeneity also increased when results from
di<U+FB00>erent contexts were combined. Table 6 demonstrates that the
heterogeneity levels of the 4 comparable factors are lower in each
context compared to their aggregated levels as shown in Table 5.
3.2.5. Publication bias
The current review included both published and unpublished
studies. Only 5 associations (distance to destination, availability of
recreational facilities, residential density, intersection density and road
density) in this study met the eligibility criterion to apply the ‘Funnel
Plot’ followed by Egger test as per discussion in Section 2.6.5. The
visual interpretation of the ‘Funnel Plots’ and results from the Egger
regression test together con<U+FB01>rm that one association su<U+FB00>ers from a high
level of publication bias (availability of recreational facilities-CIM). The
‘Fail-Safe N’ test also con<U+FB01>rmed this (Table 5). This test was not
applicable to the tra<U+FB03>c volume variable because the test requires a
minimum of 3 studies to identify publication bias. However, the ES of
this variable was found to be non-signi<U+FB01>cant, and as a result, the Fail-
Safe N test has little relevance for this factor. In essence, a Fail-Safe N
test indicates the number of additional publications required to bring
the ES down to not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant. The <U+FB01>ndings from the ‘Fail-
Safe N’ results indicate that most of the signi<U+FB01>cant ESs are not a<U+FB00>ected
by publication bias in this research because a large number (> 20 in
most cases) of additional studies are needed to nullify the results
(Table 5).

Fig. 5. The variable e<U+FB00>ects of land
were found to be reversed in case of CIM. This is conceptually plausible
for children because dead-end streets generally serve less tra<U+FB03>c with
protected opportunities for children's outdoor activities (Brown and
Werner, 1985; Carver et al., 2008; Hochschild, 2013). Furthermore,
low-density tra<U+FB03>c in front of child's home reduce safety concerns and
ease parental restrictions (Islam et al., 2014; Moore, 1986). However,
the con<U+FB02>icting <U+FB01>ndings between these two aged groups raise an
important policy concern: how to design streets that facilitate walking
for all aged groups, or in other words, how should city planner and
urban designer negotiate between dead-ends and connected streets for
the provisioning of road networks within a neighbourhood? It is also
noticeable from the current review of the literature on BE-CIM link that
the topological dimension of street network has rarely been studied. In
contrast, the impact of street topology (measured using space syntax
based indicators) on adult walking behaviour is increasingly being
reported (Koohsari et al., 2016; Lee and Seo, 2013).
Unlike street design factors, the impacts of the distribution of land
uses were found to be mostly positive (proportion of residential land
use, proportion of commercial land use and residential location type).
In contrast, the ES of land use mix variable was found to have the
largest negative value among all the land use variables. Few relation-
ships thus require a careful interpretation from a policy perspective.
First, a signi<U+FB01>cant positive ES of the proportion of residential land and
an insigni<U+FB01>cant negative ES of residential density factor suggest that
having a large residential area is important to enhance CIM irrespective
of the design density. Second, this large residential zone must accom-
modate patches of commercial facilities (but not other land use types).
Again, the commercial patches must be located close by. Third, priority
should be given to the distribution of land uses of children's interest.
Destinations where children might be interested in going from daily to
occasional basis (e.g. school, friends' house, leisure destinations) should
be located in close proximity. This is due to the fact that longer travel
distance not only increases the restrictions on independent travel
(Cervero, 1996; Zwerts et al., 2010), but also encourages the use of
motorised vehicles and child's chau<U+FB00>euring to destinations (Bradshaw,
1995; Fyhri et al., 2011; Mackett, 2002). Therefore, the <U+FB01>ndings are
mostly consistent with prior studies on children mobility behaviour
except for the land use mix factor. Finding from this research con<U+FB01>rms
that land use mix shrinks the territorial range of children (O'Brien et al.,
2000; Villanueva et al., 2012b). Though for active travel, a greater land
use mix has been reported to be an important predictor among
adolescents (Larsen et al., 2009) and adults (Frank et al., 2003; Owen

Journal of Transport Geography 61 (2017) 104–117
use mix on CIM between di<U+FB00>erent subgroups.
et al., 2004; Powell et al., 2003), but when it comes to children's
independent travel, an increasing number of people on street due to
diverse land uses might reduce mobility license and increase safety
concern among children and parents. This <U+FB01>nding con<U+FB01>rms the negative
impact of ‘stranger fear’ on CIM of previous studies (Hillman et al.,
1990; Joshi and MacLean, 1995; Prezza et al., 2005; Valentine, 1997).
The generic <U+FB01>ndings and observations, as reported previously,
might not be fully applicable in all contexts. As found in this research,
the e<U+FB00>ects of the BE factors vary substantially between developed and
developing country contexts. For example, distance to destinations,
mixed land use, and intersection density factors were found to be a
stronger barrier of CIM in developing countries whereas they have little
to no e<U+FB00>ect in the context of developed country. In contrast, the width
of vehicular street has the largest negative e<U+FB00>ect in the context of
developed country but little e<U+FB00>ect in developing countries. This is
largely due to the di<U+FB00>erences in safety perception between these
contexts. It is likely that an increase of vehicular street width is likely
to increase tra<U+FB03>c volume, tra<U+FB03>c speed and accident, and therefore, this
factor is a greater concern for parents and children from developed
countries. The variation in the level of CIM was also observed between
settlement patterns (urban vs. suburb) within a context. These <U+FB01>ndings
add to the understanding of the spatial dynamics of BE-CIM relationship
(Priemus et al., 2001). It clearly shows how CIM changes with respect to
the changes in the built environment, be it: contextual di<U+FB00>erences, or
di<U+FB00>erences in urban structure (urban-suburban), or di<U+FB00>erences in urban
form (density, dead-end streets).
One general observation that can be drawn from the <U+FB01>ndings of this
research is that there exists a large heterogeneity among the primary
studies. These statistical inconsistencies are the results of substantial
di<U+FB00>erences in study locations (e.g. context, culture, and settlement
pattern), study designs and sample characteristics (gender, age, size)
among the primary studies. For example, further analysis (not reported
in this paper) shows that the strongest e<U+FB00>ect of dead-end streets is more
applicable to boys than girls in developing countries. This clearly re<U+FB02>ect
the need for peer accompaniment for girls to make them more
comfortable to undertake independent mobility (Mackett et al.,
2007). Moreover, no standard measurement strategies, either to
represent BE factors or to represent CIM, have been followed in the
primary studies. The inconsistencies in methods and measurement
strategies hampered the homogeneity of the <U+FB01>ndings reported in this
study. Often the survey instruments used in CIM studies are borrowed
from the literature explaining adult travel behaviour which might not
