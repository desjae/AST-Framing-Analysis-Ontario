access to parents as a ‘transport service’ by the help of the mobile phone. The measures that different
countries use in trying to meet the challenges of children’s mobility tend to focus on the school trip and
most often on traf<U+FB01>c safety, both at national and local levels.

received less attention. As will be shown later in this paper,
knowledge about this aspect of children’s mobility is sparse and
scattered, which implies a limited basis for policy actions.
The concentration on the journey to school for policy measures
means less attention has been paid to other policy <U+FB01>elds that might
have an impact on children’s active travel and independent
mobility, e.g. centralization of schools, which often means longer
journeys. More students in private schools compared to public
schools and freedom of choice of school can often result in longer
journeys to schools. Land use and transport policies, urban devel-
opmental policy, family policies and politics of equality can also
have an impact on children’s daily mobility. When discussing
measures, it is also important to be aware of these <U+FB01>elds. In
addition to policy areas, there are also social trends that, directly
or indirectly, have effects on children’s independent mobility, and
contribute to the forming of the social framework of everyday life.
Knowledge about these trends will be a help in understanding
children’s mobility and will give a better basis for the selection of
measurements to improve the conditions for active travel and
independent mobility among children. In this paper we use
walking and cycling as a proxy for independent mobility where
more speci<U+FB01>c data are not available. Since statistics on children’s
mobility do not always provide information about accompanying.
In addition the possibility for walking and cycling safely is an
important condition for children’s independent mobility.
The purpose of this paper is to contribute to a better under-
standing of children’s mobility and the social framework of daily
mobility in families with children, and to examine the measures
that are used to increase active and independent mobility in
different countries. We also aim to discuss how these measures
can be improved.
In doing so, three topics are presented and discussed. Firstly, we
want to compare the development of children’s independent
mobility in Denmark, Finland, Great Britain and Norway to
examine the trends in these countries and look for similarities
and differences. Accessible data are used, which implies that not all
of them are directly comparable, but they are used as indicators of
development. Secondly, social trends that contribute to the forma-
tion of the social context of everyday life for children and their
families are presented and discussed. Thirdly, we show how the
different countries try to meet the challenges of children’s mobility
by looking at measures at national and local levels.
Finally, we aim to discuss differences in children’s independent
mobility in the light of variations in social structures, differences in
institutional frameworks and in institutional and legal measures to
give a better basis for implementing measurements for the increase
of independence in children’s mobility. Before presenting these
three topics, the methods adopted in this paper are introduced.


2. Methods

This paper is one of the results of a joint project involving
researchers from four countries: Denmark, Finland, Great Britain
and Norway and funded by the Norwegian Research Council. The

project has included three research themes: (i) mobility and
activity in daily life; social trends and development, (ii) analysis
of children’s activity and travel patterns in different contexts, and
(iii) review and discussion of ‘good-practice’ initiatives to reduce
children’s car use.
The project has employed a ‘mixed methods design’, which is
re<U+FB02>ected in this paper including analysis of primary and second-
ary data and analysis of policy documents.
One of the most important data sources in this paper are the
National Travel Surveys (NTS) which are carried out in all four
countries. The NTS give socio-demographic information about the
respondent and his/her household, such as level of education,
income, occupation, number of children and their age, etc., travel
activity on a particular day (registration day), work trips and other
work-related questions, access to a car(s) and quality of public
transport. The surveys also provide information about the frequency
of use of different modes of transport (both cars and other modes).
The NTS is large cross-sectional surveys representing the whole
population of the four countries (cf. Table 1). On a general level the
surveys provide comparable data, even if there are some variations
in data collection methods in these four countries. The sources
for these data are Jensen and Hummer (2002) for Denmark,

nen 02/01/2006 for Finland, for Norway we have own access to data
<U+FB01>les from the National Travel Surveys, and for Great Britain, the
National Travel Survey published annually by the UK Department
for Transport (2009).
In addition to the NTS, other types of available data and
surveys have been utilized for the purpose of this paper. This is
research partly carried out by the authors, partly carried out by
other researchers. Not all of these data are directly comparable
between the countries, which we also have commented upon.
A third data source is policy documents measures concerning
children’s daily mobility in the four countries, on both national
and local levels. These documents have been analyzed and
compared.


3. Children’s mobility in four countries

3.1. The journey to and from school

All four countries carry out national travel surveys, some
continuously, and some with <U+FB01>xed time intervals. Table 1 shows
the characteristics of the different surveys.
As Table 1 indicates, there are differences in both the age of
the respondents and in the time frame of the surveys, but the
questions about daily trips in the various surveys are comparable.
Great Britain has the best data describing the development of
children’s mobility. In addition to these data sources, there have
been special surveys (mostly travel to school) at national and
local levels in the various countries. These data will be used to
present similarities and differences in children’s mode choice in
the four countries.

A. Fyhri et al. / Transport
As Table 2 indicates, there are national differences. The
number of children taken by car is higher in Great Britain than
in the Nordic countries and children in Denmark use their bicycle
to school more frequently than in the other countries. Typically, it
seems that children in Great Britain either walk or are taken by
car, whereas Scandinavian children use a wider range of transport
modes; about one of <U+FB01>ve use public transport, which includes the
school bus. The bus can be seen as a more ‘active’ transportation
mode than the car, since it usually includes walking to and from
the bus stop. Since the age group in GB is younger than in the
other countries, this may explain some of the differences in car
use, but probably only part of it.
Table 3 shows travel mode to and from school for children at
secondary school level in the four countries. The table con<U+FB01>rms
the differences that could be seen for the younger children. About
half of the children in Denmark in this age group use their bicycle
to and from school, while as many as 24% of the children are
taken to school by car in Great Britain. In Norway a large number
of the children use public transport (including special school
buses). Thus, it seems that the high amount of car use among
younger children in the UK is not just a result of differences in
age by school start, but is a genuine difference, and that this
difference exists also for older children. Several studies have
shown that amount of car use decreases substantially with
increasing age (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Jensen, 2008).

3.2. Trends and patterns of change

A study from 2004 (Fyhri, 2006) showed that 25% of children
in Norway were taken to school by car, including nearly 40%
of the youngest children and 16% of those in the 6th grade

(11 years). In Norway, the use of car increased from 4% to 11%
for the age group 12–15 from 1992 to 2005.
In Denmark, the share of children 6–15 year old taken to
school by car doubled, possibly tripled, from 1978 to 2000 (Jensen
and Hummer, 2002, p. 71). The share of children 6–10 year old
walking to school fell with almost 40% in the same period. During
leisure time, the 11–15 year olds have tripled their car trips
and diminished their level of cycling by about 30% in the period
1978–2000 (Jensen, 2008, p. 483).
In Finland the use of car increased from 16% among children
aged 6–12 in 1998–99 to 20% in 2004–05 (the National Travel
Survey of Finland 2004–2005, <U+FB01>gures downloaded (cf. the
Methods section)).
In 1985, 10% of children in the age group 11–16 years in the
UK were taken to school by car, while by 2008 the proportion had
increased to 21% (Department for Transport, 2009). The <U+FB01>gures
from the British National Travel Survey give more detailed
information about the development of mode use on trips to and
from school, as shown in Tables 4 and 5.
For the youngest children, aged 5–10, there has been an
increase in car use from 22% to 48% from 1985 to 2008
(Table 4). For the group aged 11–16 years there was an increase
from 10% to 21% in the same period (Table 5). The increase in car
use results in a corresponding decline in independent mobility in
the form of walking and cycling. The use of public transport has
changed little in the period.

3.3. Distance to school

Both in Great Britain and in Norway the distance to school has
increased in recent decades. In Great Britain, the distance
increased both for children aged 5–10 and children aged 11–16

(Table 6).
In Norway the average distance to school increased from
3.6 km in 1992 to 4.9 km in 2001 for children aged 13–15
(The Norwegian National Travel survey).

In Finland there are also indications of increased distances to

school. There are no data concerning the average distances to
school, but it is known that the proportion of elementary school
children living closer than 500 m from school was 29.8% in 2000

and it decreased to 28.3% in 2008 (Elyse, 2008). This is mainly due

to schools being concentrated into larger units. Between 2003 and
2007 the proportion of children attending small schools ( o50

pupils) decreased by 27% and the proportion of large school
attendants (4 500 pupils) increased by 22% (Kumpulainen, 2008).

Similarly, in Denmark the tendency has been that that public
schools are merged into bigger units, creating longer transport
distances, and changes in transport mode. In Denmark among
10–16 years old with less than 1.5 km to school, 73% go by foot or

by bike (Jensen and Hummer, 2002, p. 69).

Parallel to this there has also been an increase in the number of
children in private schools, in Denmark (Danmarks lærerforening,
2010), Norway (SSB, 2010) and England (Department for Children,
Family and Schools, 2008). The governments in these countries have

seen ‘choice’ as a policy objective, including for schools. As car
ownership has increased, the size of the set of schools that parents
perceive as accessible has increased, and more parents have been
able to exercise the choice of ‘best’ school by choosing schools that
are further away.


3.4. Accompaniment

Several studies of the reasons for accompanying children to
school have identi<U+FB01>ed traf<U+FB01>c or ‘stranger danger’ as important
factors (Hillman et al., 1990; Joshi and MacLean, 1995; Joshi et al.,
1999; Valentine, 1997). The motives, however, seems to vary
between countries, as will be shown in this section. Since the
surveys are carried out using different methods and some of them
at different years, the comparison has to be done with care.
The British National Travel Survey (NTS) has, in recent years,
added more explicit questions about accompaniment to school.
Table 7 shows an increase in number of children being accom-
panied, both in the younger and the older groups. They also ask
about the reasons for doing so, as shown in Table 8.
For the youngest group the most important reason to accom-
pany the children is traf<U+FB01>c danger, but nearly 30% of the parents
point out fear of assault/molestation as a reason. For children
from 11 to 13 years, traf<U+FB01>c danger was also stated as the most
important reason, while convenience and distance to school come
as the next most frequent. It is claimed that in order to be a ‘good
responsible parent’, most parents would stress certain worries
(Valentine and McKendrick, 1997). It is a general trend in the
‘risk society’ to monitor and keep your child under surveillance
(Fotel and Thomsen, 2004).
A nationwide Norwegian study about children’s physical
activities and daily travel from 2005 included a question about
why the child (6–12 years) was taken to school by car. The results
are shown in Table 9. ‘The same route as to parent’s workplace’

was mentioned most often and nearly three times as frequently as
traf<U+FB01>c danger.
A study from Denmark shows that worries about traf<U+FB01>c was
the most important reason for parents to accompany their
children (Fotel, 2007, p. 157). The next was worrying about other
adults (molestation). In Finland, results vary mainly with where
people live. The Finnish national housing study (Strandell, 2005)
reveals that city parents perceive traf<U+FB01>c as more dangerous than
parents living in other types of areas do. 42% of city dwellers and
less than 25% of the inhabitants of other areas perceive traf<U+FB01>c too
dangerous for a 7-year-old child moving independently.
As stated above, these surveys are not directly comparable, as
both the sample sizes and questions are different. But the results
from the four countries point at differences that probably can be
connected to the physical environment, the traf<U+FB01>c situations,
attitudes and cultural variations in child rearing.
While the largest concerns of British and Danish parents of
younger children are traf<U+FB01>c danger and the fear of assault or
molestation, the main reasons Norwegian parents mention for
taking their children by car is because it is on the same route as to
one of the parents’ work. The Norwegian parents are also
concerned with the traf<U+FB01>c, but it is not mentioned as often as
reasons related to convenience. As we see among the Finnish
parents, there is a signi<U+FB01>cant difference between urban and rural
parents concerning traf<U+FB01>c danger, which probable is true also for
the other countries.

3.5. Leisure travel

Compared with school trips, there is much less information
about trips related to leisure activities and longitudinal data is
scarce.

A. Fyhri et al. / Transport
Based on calculations using data from the National Travel
Survey (Department for Transport, 2009), in Great Britain, the
modal split of children’s non-school trips show a percentage of
car use of 64 in 2008, which has increased from 56% in 1996/98.
In Finland, The National Travel Survey shows that the percen-
tage of children, 6–12 years, taken by car to their leisure activi-
ties in 2004–2005 was 45%, compared to 42% in 1998–1999
(The National Travel Survey of Finland 2004–2005).
In Norway (2005) the car use for leisure varied from 48% to
73%. For example, 63% of the children are taken by car to their
sports activities (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2006).
These <U+FB01>gures illustrate two trends; increased car ownership
and more organized leisure activities outside the immediate
neighborhood, which will be discussed in the next section.


4. The social framework for everyday activities in families
with children

The development of children’s daily mobility presented
in Section 2 indicates changes in the social conditions that
contribute to a decrease in children’s active and independent
mobility and that have produced a more ‘mobility demanding’
society. In this section we shall discuss some of these conditions
and trends. The discussion here will concentrate on key social
factors that in<U+FB02>uence the development of children’s mobility.


4.1. Employment rates


The increase in paid employment for women means that in

most families both parents are working. In Norway for example,

more than 80% of mothers with children 5+ years of age are in

paid work (Kitterød, 2005). Their pre-school-age children there-

fore need to be transported to day care centers or care facilities,

and children in the lower grades usually need to be escorted to

school. Table 10 shows the development of the employment rate

for men and women in the four countries, which illustrates an

increase in equality between the genders.

The employment rate (de<U+FB01>ned in this way) among women

varies between 66% and 75%, and there has been an increase

between 1997 and 2008 (Table 10). The rate among women is

somewhat higher in the Nordic countries than in the UK. The

employment rate for men is higher than for women but the

growth over time is greater for women. Overall, the <U+FB01>gures

The employment rate is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged

15–64 in employment by the total population of the same age group. The indicator
is based on the EU Labour Force Survey. The survey covers the entire population
living in private households and excludes those in collective households such as
boarding houses, halls of residence and hospitals. Employed population consists of
those persons who during the reference week did any work for pay or pro<U+FB01>t for at
least one hour, or were not working but had jobs from which they were
temporarily absent. /http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/refreshTableAction.

Figures from 1997 are not available, instead <U+FB01>gures from 2000 are used.

indicate a high employment rate among both mothers and
fathers.
However, the major increase in employment among women
took place earlier. In Norway for instance, the female employment
increased from 45% in 1972 to 62% in 1991, which changed the
conditions for everyday life for many families. It was also in the
1970s that the concept ‘Life-cycle squeeze’ appeared
(Oppenheimer, 1974), and time problems in family life became
a topic both for public discussion and research in the social
sciences.
Time problems in families can be solved in many ways.
Reducing working hours is one way to cope with a time pressure
situation. In all of these countries part-time employment is a
much more common among women than among men.
Another way is trying to reduce travel time, either by not
traveling or by using a high speed transport mode like the car
(which however, can be slow in e.g. the rush hour).

4.2. Car ownership

Compared to other household categories, families with chil-
dren tend to have very good access to car(s). In Denmark 80% of
families with children own at least one car (Statistics Denmark,
2005). In Finland 97% of families with two parents and 61% of
those with one parent own a car (Partanen, 2009). In England 90%
of household with dependent children own at least one car (Of<U+FB01>ce
for National Statistics, 2010). In other English households the
percentage is 73.

In Norway 97% of households with children have at least one
car, with a lower percentage for those who do not have children

(Norwegian National Travel Survey 2005). As these <U+FB01>gures indi-

cate, the level of car ownership is high in families with children

with some variations: lowest in Denmark, highest in Norway.

A common opinion among families with children is that the

car is a matter of necessity. Without the car, it is claimed that

there is not enough time to carry out the daily activities

(Freudendal-Pedersen, 2007; Hjorthol, 2006). Many families have

adjusted their everyday lives to the existence of the automobile.

When the day care center and the parent’s job are in different

parts of the city, the use of public transport can be cumbersome.

The routine nature of daily life is based on habitual use of the car.

A literature review of children’s independent mobility and active

transportation (AT) found that car ownership (in addition to

greater distance, and increasing household income) is consis-

tently associated with lower rates of AT among children aged
5–18 (Pont et al., 2009).


4.3. Participation in organized activities

The level of participation in organized leisure activities for
children is interesting with respect to their daily mobility.
Unfortunately, we have little information about this topic in all
of the countries.

In Denmark 68% of the children 7–15 years took part in
organized sport activities in 2004. Most popular was football
and swimming, then follows handball, badminton and gymnastics

(Bille and Wulff, 2006, p. 109).

In Norway (2005) about 75% of all children in the age group

6–12 years take part in some sort of organized sports activity,
primarily football. In addition, 23% sing in a choir or play in a
band, and 19% are member of other organization for children
(Hjorthol and Fyhri, 2009).


In Finland the proportion of children who engage in sports
activities was 91% among 3–18-year-olds in 2005–06 (The

Statistical Databases of the Statistics Finland, 2007). Football,

cycling and skiing were the most popular sports in 2005–06
(National Physical Exercise Study, 2005–6). The share of children
practicing sports was 15% higher in 2005–06 compared to 1995.
46% of 10–14-year-old children participate actively in music
lessons (Hani<U+FB01>, 2009). About 24% of 9–13-year-old children living
in Helsinki engaged in an art related hobby in 2008 (Stenvall,
2009). Finally, 44% are members of an association or a club
(Myllyniemi, 2009).

In Britain, children aged 8–15 spent an average of 29 min a
week on sports and outdoor activities in 2000, compared with
94 min on hobbies and games and 61 min on social life and
entertainment (Of<U+FB01>ce of National Statistics, 2003).
Many of these activities take place outside the immediate
neighborhood, and for that reason will be in need of transport,
very often motorized due to the distance.

4.4. Access to mobile phones
Mobile telephony has introduced the ability to call or ‘text’
quickly to others to e.g. to change plans or make inquiries. This
communication technology allows for a ‘micro-coordination’ of
social interaction (Ling, 2004). Townsend (2000) claims that
freedom from punctuality is experienced with the mobile phone.
He states: ‘Once one becomes accustomed to the <U+FB02>exibility of
scheduling, the freedom from punctuality permitted by the ability
to constantly updating other parties as to one’s status, it is nearly
inconceivable to go back (Townsend, 2000, p. 94).
The proliferation of mobile phones has changed the way
families organize their everyday life. A nationwide survey in
Norway on use of the mobile telephone in the organization of
daily life in families with children under 18 years, suggests that
this device is important in everyday communication among
family members (Hjorthol, 2008). This study showed that from
the age of 10–11 years between 80% and 90% of the children had
their own mobile phone. In this study, the use of transport mode
to and from leisure activities for children varied by planning
horizon. This survey found a signi<U+FB01>cant correlation between the
amount of time in advance the daily activity was planned, the use
of mobile phone and the frequency of car use (Hjorthol, 2008).
Many children have their own mobile phone. A recent survey
carried out for the European Commission in 2008 shows that a
high percentage of children, also in the lower age groups have a
mobile phone (Table 11).
In Norway the percentage is about 90% among children aged
10–12 (Telenor, 2008), and has reached 100% at the age of
13–14 years.


5. Measures related to children’s mobility

The presentation and discussion of social trends in Section 3
indicate a development towards an increasingly mobile society
with the car in a core position. In Fig. 1 these trends are
summarized showing the contextual framework of children’s
(and their parents’) daily lives.
Policy 18 (2011) 703–710
















Fig. 1



These interdependent ‘everyday realities’ illustrate that the
reasons for increased car-used cannot be ascribed to one indivi-
dual factor alone. The pertinent question, however, is whether
they are all re<U+FB02>ected in policies and measurements in the four
countries?
5.1. Policy measures at a national level
An assessment of the national policies concerning children’s
daily mobility reveals that children’s car dependency in everyday
transport is not a clear national policy issue in any of these
countries, at least not for the transport authorities. These four
countries all offer free public transport to (the nearest) school,
depending on age and distance, and all countries have some sort
of traf<U+FB01>c education in school. The most important issues in these
educational programs are how to behave in the traf<U+FB01>c environ-
ment, the traf<U+FB01>c rules, and traf<U+FB01>c safety.
Traf<U+FB01>c safety is also the primary issue concerning children and
transport at national levels. For example, in the Norwegian national
transport plan for 2006–2015 (St meld no. 24, 2003–2004) issues
concerned with topics other than traf<U+FB01>c safety are mentioned only
once, which was a comment about the increase in escorting trips of
children.
Children’s independent, safe and sustainable mobility is also
mentioned in the Finnish Transport policy guideline paper (2008),
where children’s mobility is mainly seen as a traf<U+FB01>c safety issue
and/or urban planning policy issue. The report lists future guide-
lines for transport policy until 2020. These include the improve-
ments in public transport and traf<U+FB01>c safety. In traf<U+FB01>c safety work,
special attention should be paid to the mobility of children, which
requires better co-operation between the administrative sectors
(Ministry of Transport and Communications, 2008).
Both in Great Britain and in Norway the national health autho-
rities have initiated physical activity programs and campaigns for
children related to the school trip, in Norway in co-operation with
the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the police and the
Norwegian Council for Road Safety.
In Great Britain the national government gives grants and
funding to schools that produce travel plans and initiate walking
school buses. To our knowledge such measures do not exist in the
other countries.
Whereas traf<U+FB01>c safety organizations provide educational
material for schools and kindergartens in the Scandinavian
countries, this is a governmental responsibility in Great Britain,
implemented by local authorities.

A. Fyhri et al. / Transport
5.2. Local policy measures and measures initiated by schools,
parents or other local groups

The municipalities and the regional authorities have the
responsibilities for safe school journeys in these countries. There
is a lack of systematic information about campaigns etc initiated
by municipalities and regional authorities.
In Denmark 81% of the municipalities have special initiatives
to improve the transport and safety of children attending schools.
Only 19% of the municipalities have no initiatives, except from a
campaign at the beginning the year (Jensen and Hummer, 2002).
Some measures that are initiated by local authorities in one
country are conducted through schools, or governance networks
involving both public and private actors, including the police, in
another country (for example, walking buses).
One concrete measure that has been tried out in all of the four
countries is ‘Walking school buses’. Walking school buses (WSB)
are typically organized locally as systems where parents take
turns in escorting a small group of children from their homes to
school and back. This measure is thus based on the initiative and
motivation of the parents. As such, it is a transient measure and
will only last as long as the parents have children that need to be
escorted (and the children are willing to be escorted). This has
been raised as a criticism of the measure, but it could be argued
that as long as the measure is effective, this is not necessarily a
problem. A related argument is that children of parents who do
not volunteer to take part in the measure may suffer from being
left out of the program, which would not be the case if this
measure was not based on volunteerism.
An assessment of WSB in Christchurch, New Zealand, did not
discuss this problem, but focussed on the bene<U+FB01>ts (Kingham and
Ussher, 2007). They found that WSB contributed to better social
connections, enhancement of children’s health, time savings (parents
not having to escort children to school every day), got children into
the habit of walking and, in that way increased, their independence.
There is little information about the extent and diffusion of
walking buses, how they work or evaluations of the scheme in
these four countries. One rare example is the evaluation of
walking buses as an intervention including the effects on physical
activity (Mackett et al., 2005b). Another example is a Norwegian
study were walking school buses and walking companion
schemes were included among several measures that were tested
for their effect on independent mobility (Fyhri, 2006).


6. Discussion and conclusions

The presentation and discussion of the development of chil-
dren’s everyday mobility in Denmark, Finland, Norway and UK
show a similar trend overall. We see a reduction in independent
mobility like walking and cycling to school and an increase in car
use. The reasons the parents give for taking children to school by
car are primarily motivated by traf<U+FB01>c danger and fear of assaults
(with some exceptions from Norwegian studies that indicate that
convenience also play a part). It is also in<U+FB02>uenced by the increase
in car ownership and the increase in female employment, which is
a positive and desirable development. As illustrated and summar-
ized by Fig. 1, the trends and conditions are interdependent.
Traf<U+FB01>c danger as a reason is a paradox, since most of the local
traf<U+FB01>c around the schools is often generated by the parents
themselves. By taking their children by car, other parents may
feel obliged to do the same to avoid the risk of their children of

being involved in traf<U+FB01>c accidents by letting them walk or cycle.
Even though the information comes from different types of

surveys and is not directly comparable, the same pattern is found
in all four countries; the amount of independent mobility is less
Policy 18 (2011) 703–710                                                             709
for leisure related travel than for the school trips. It can be
claimed that as lifestyles have become more urbanized children’s
leisure travel has become more motorized because organized
activities can be far away and reachable only by car compared to
earlier decades when leisure time was spent closer to homes and
activities less organized. The positive aspect of this is the greater
variety of choice parents and children have regarding leisure
activities. As such children also bene<U+FB01>t from automobility
(Thomsen, 2004). In families without a car it might be a risk that
children (and parents) are ‘left behind’ (Fotel, 2007).
Although there are differences between these four countries
the overall picture of children’s mobility is very similar; the trend
is towards less walking and cycling and more transport by
(private) car. Not only the transport patterns show many simila-
rities, but also the social changes forming the contextual frame-
work for families’ daily life are quite comparable.
The framework of everyday activities in families with children
is characterized by a high degree of employment among the
parents, both for fathers and mothers, although a relatively large
percentage of mothers in these countries work part-time. There
are indications of an active life also for children—illustrated by
the high numbers of children taking part in organized leisure
activities. Families with children are highly motorized, even if
there are differences regarding one- and two-parent household.
The easy access to the car makes car use almost obvious. The
mobile phone is a relatively new ‘tool’ for communication
between family members and for assisting in organizing daily
activities. The interplay between the mobile phone and easy
access to the car seems to lessen the need for planning the daily
activities and reinforce the car use.
When there are two working parents in a family, there are
often periods of the day when things are more hectic, chaotic or
time pressured than others. The most pressing time periods are in
the morning, when all family members are getting ready to leave
for work, school or day care, and in the early evening when there
is time for a meal before leisure activities such as sports and
music begin. Shortage of time is a common reason given by
parents for transporting their children to leisure activities by car
(Hjorthol et al., 2005, 2006; Freudendal-Pedersen, 2007).
Even though the decrease in children’s active and independent
mobility is undesirable for many reasons, the policy measures
to meet this challenge are limited and lack a comprehensive
perspective. Our summary of these measures and schemes indi-
cate that they are mainly connected to the journey to school, even
if it is only part of children’s mobility. Our review of the measures
also denotes a lack of continuity of initiated schemes, and some of
them are dependent on volunteers from schools or parents. In
addition evaluations of schemes are rare or completely lacking.
Our discussion of social trends contributing to the decrease in
independent mobility shows that different policy <U+FB01>elds are
involved. A more holistic approach is needed to develop more
comprehensive policies in order to change the trends affecting
children’s mobility.
The presentation and discussion in this paper also reveals a lack
of data about the totality of children’s mobility in most of these
countries, especially longitudinal data. Surveys of children’s mobility
are needed to give basic knowledge to policy makers. Carrying out
the same surveys in several countries in order to make comparisons,
with repetitions at de<U+FB01>ned intervals to see whether the actual
policies have effects would be particularly advantageous.
