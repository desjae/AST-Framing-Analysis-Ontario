Key Messages
 Children have meaningful insight to offer towards a better understanding of how their local
environment influences active school travel behaviours.
 The use of participatory mapping and qualitative GIS methodology provides a unique opportunity for
children to share their spatial knowledge.
 Furthering our understanding of how children’s perceptions influence their journey to and from
school will help to inform policy and practice supporting localized active school travel
interventions.
Children today are spending more sedentary time indoors than time playing and being active outdoors. The
daily journey to and from school represents a valuable opportunity for children to be physically active
through active school travel. The majority of research on children’s active school travel omits children from
the research process even though children interpret their environments in fundamentally different ways than
adults. Our research uses innovative participatory mapping and qualitative GIS methods to examine how
children’s perceptions of their environments in<U+FB02>uence their school journey experiences. Through our
thematic analysis of 25 map-based focus groups, we identi<U+FB01>ed three main themes characterizing barriers
and enablers to active school travel: safety-related, material, and affective features. By positioning children
as experts of their environments in our participatory methodology, our <U+FB01>ndings provide an important
counterpoint to the adultist privilege characterizing the majority of research on children’s active school
travel. Environmental features that mattered for children’s school journeys took on multiple meanings in
their eyes, demonstrating that children’s perspectives must be engaged to inform interventions to promote
active school travel. We thus argue that identifying barriers and enablers to active school travel for children
requires engaging children’s views.

2011), and spatial and cognitive development
(Oliver et al. 2011). Despite these well-known
benefits, only 24% of Canadian children and youth
typically walk or wheel to and from school (Partic-
ipACTION 2016).
Decisions to participate in AST are complex and
involve a range of factors across what Sallis et al.
(2006) call the “socio-ecological” spheres of influ-
ence: intrapersonal, interpersonal, environmental,
and policy. Carlson et al. (2014) found that child-
ren’s AST is shaped by varying features and that the
most effective way to increase children’s AST is by
targeting multiple levels of the socio-ecological
framework. For children’s AST, the environmental
level is particularly important because interven-
tions focusing on the built environment can have
wide-reaching population-level effects. A growing
body of research indicates that specific elements of
the built environment can influence walking behav-
iours and whether a child travels actively to and
from school (McMillan 2007; Larsen et al. 2009;
Giles-Corti et al. 2005; Van Loon and Frank 2011).
The built environment comprises buildings, spaces,
and products that are created and modified by
people (e.g., urban design, transportation systems,
land-use planning) (Bhugra and Minas 2007). While
previous research has focused on the links between
personal and/or social factors associated with
children’s AST, little is known about the role of
the built environment (Brug et al. 2006; Santos et al.
2008). Furthermore, there is even less known about
children’s perceptions of the built environment
as it pertains to AST; most research focuses on
objectively measured features of the environment.
Quantitative methods, which currently dominate
the AST literature, perpetuate the assumption that
the built environment is a fixed entity, void of the
perceptions people relate to it (Fusco et al. 2012).
Considering children’s perceptions is important
because objective measures do not necessarily tell
us about how environmental features operate in
children’s worlds (Wilson et al. 2018). Understand-
ing how environments afford opportunities for AST
thus requires accounting for children’s perceptions
(Chemero 2003). Our study looks beyond objective
assessments of the built environment to examine
children’s perceptions of their environments during
their school journeys. Evidence about how children
perceive specific features in their neighbourhoods
and areas surrounding school can be used to adapt
interventions and promote AST. In order to increase
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):

AST, it is critical to understand children’s first-hand
experiences of their school journeys.
The majority of research on children’s AST has
been done on rather than with or for children (Sallis
et al. 2000; Darbyshire et al. 2005; Fusco et al. 2013).
Given that parents are often assumed to be gate-
keepers, ultimately deciding whether or not chil-
dren can walk to and from school (McMillan 2005), it
is not surprising that the bulk of AST research has
utilized adult and parent perspectives (McMillan
2005; Sirard and Slater 2008; Larsen et al. 2009).
However, parents are not necessarily able to imagine
children’s perceptions of their environments as
children interpret and experience their environ-
ments in fundamentally different ways than adults
(James 1990; Hyun 2005; Barker and Weller 2009).
Examining how children’s lives, experiences, atti-
tudes, and opportunities are socially and spatially
structured is valuable for better understanding
children’s AST behaviours. Critical perspectives in
children’s geographies have cautioned that the
majority of geographical research has historically
focused on adult experiences, even when research is
applicable to both children and adults (James 1990;
Holloway 2014). We know that the way children and
adults use, perceive, and experience space can be
vastly different, even within the same environment
(James 1990; Punch 2002). Taking children’s per-
spectives seriously is not simply about “letting”
children speak; it is about investigating the specific
contributions that children’s perspectives can pro-
vide to our understanding of and theorizing about
the social world (James and Prout 1990).
Methodologically realizing child-centred ap-
proaches involves critically reflecting on the un-
equal power dynamics between child participants
and researchers, as well as how research can be
designed to mitigate children’s perceptions of
research participation as intimidating or boring
(Punch 2002; Barker and Weller 2009). Children may
provide more engaged research input when they are
interested in the topic and working with researchers
who share their interests (Agar 2006). Hart’s (1992)
theory of child participation claims that children
need to be genuinely and significantly involved in
research concerning them in order to produce
meaningful results. Common features of participa-
tory research with children include participants
understanding the issue at hand, taking this issue
seriously, assuming a leadership role, and/or
determining the extent of their participation. While
112–128



adults may bring the topic forward, research needs
to include components that are child-led and
directed. Methods that take on participatory prin-
ciples during data collection can illuminate nuances
of children’s perceptions of their environments.
Research that engages children through the use of
participatory methodology has been shown to be
effective in furthering our understanding of child-
ren’s environmental experiences (Loebach and Gilli-
land 2010).
In this study, we explore the environmental
contexts of children’s school journeys using partic-
ipatory mapping and qualitative GIS techniques as a
child-centred approach to engage children on the
AST issues that matter to them. Specifically, we ask
three questions:

(1) What environmental features do children per-
ceive to be barriers or enablers to using active
travel on their school journeys?
(2) How do children’s perceptions of environmental
barriers and enablers differ in urban versus
suburban settings?
(3) What improvements would children like to see
in their local environments to support AST?

In doing so, we aim to contribute to the evidence

informing solutions to make environments more

supportive of children’s AST.




Methods
Recruitment and sample
Participants were recruited from two elementary
schools in southwestern Ontario, Canada that were

completing a school travel planning intervention

process. Given that the literature shows specific
characteristics of environments influence walking
(Saelens and Handy 2008), we chose one suburban
school and one urban school to explore how
diverse neighbourhoods might have different

influences on children’s school journeys. Letters

of information and consent forms were given to
children at both schools to bring home to parents.
Postal codes were collected on the consent forms

to allow us to group students who lived within the

same neighbourhoods for the participatory map-
ping exercises. Participants were divided into map-
based focus groups by postal code so that students

Children’s perspectives on active school travel                115
with similar neighbourhood settings, walking
distance, and mode of travel could discuss these
common features experienced on their journeys to
and from school. The study protocol was approved
by the Non-Medical Research Ethics Boards of the
University of Western Ontario (NMREB #: 105635)
and the Thames Valley District School Board
Research and Assessment Services.
A total of 158 students across the two schools were
invited to participate, with 123 children receiving
parental consent (77.8% participation rate). Demo-
graphic characteristics, including gender, grade, and
self-identified most common form of travel are
shown in Table 1. Children were between the ages
10 to 12 years old (M¼55.3% and F¼44.7%) and in
grades five (n¼65) and six (n¼58). Previous research
shows that until a particular age, the decision about
AST is most often made by parents or guardians
(McMillan 2005; Fusco et al. 2012). Children within
this age group are beginning to travel alone to school,
developing independent perceptions of influences
on their routes to and from school. Moreover, this is
an age where children are able to substantially
participate in qualitative research, providing valu-
able perceptions of their environments (Hart 1992;
Loebach and Gilliland 2010). Nearly two-thirds

(64.5%) of students from the suburban school

typically used an active travel mode (walk or bike)

to school in the morning, compared to only one-
quarter (25.5%) from the urban school. Groups
ranged in size from four to eight participants, as
recommended for participatory focus groups in
schools to allow for more meaningful conversation

Procedure
We adopted an innovative participatory methodol-
ogy which directly involved both children and
community collaborators who have a direct stake
in the school travel planning process. A school travel
plan is a tool used by schools to increase AST rates
among students whereby school and community
stakeholders collaborate to create and implement
school-level action plans to systematically address
barriers and incentives that enable children to walk
to school. Schools participating in this research
project were already involved with an active school
travel planning program. We conducted 25 map-
based focus groups structured around participatory
mapping exercises during an annual geography
education and public awareness program called
Geography Awareness Week in November 2016.
Geography Awareness Week is promoted interna-
tionally by organizations, such as the Canadian
Association of Geographers, to celebrate geography
as a discipline and as a part of everyday life, and to
foster thinking, especially among youth, about the
relationships between people and place (National
Geographic Society n.d.). As a part of wider Geogra-
phy Awareness Week activities, we engaged six
elementary school classes in participatory mapping
exercises embedded as research within our Geogra-
phy Awareness Week activities.
Our research team has extensive experience
conducting community-based research with chil-
dren. The participatory mapping exercises were co-
led by a researcher and a community stakeholder
who held a position of decision-making authority
related to children’s journeys to and from school.
Community members included city planners, engi-
neers, teachers, public health nurses, environmen-
tal and park planners, ecologists, community
developers, and the mayor. We engaged community
stakeholders in order to provide children with the
opportunity to speak directly to experts and policy
makers about improvements they would like to see
on their journeys to and from school. We acknowl-
edge that the data collected is a product of the
research context; however, given that this research
occurred in a classroom setting where children are
used to interacting with adults in learning activities,
the presence of the researchers and community
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):

partners was not out of place. The structure of the
mapping exercise was flexible, allowing the children
to lead conversations; however, co-facilitators were
provided with an exercise guide and probing
questions to prompt discussions if conversations
between children paused. Students were encour-
aged to build off of each other’s thoughts, creating
engaged conversations in which short interjections
were constant between students. Questions centred
on children’s neighbourhood environments and
how they perceived the features within them in
relation to their journey to and from school. Each
mapping exercise lasted about 45 minutes, and was
audio-recorded. Detailed notes were also taken.
Aligning with our conceptual framing within the
socio-ecological spheres of influence, involving
community stakeholders in our research design
was an effort to connect our qualitative research
process with decision makers at the policy level
early on. Literature indicates that the most common
way to influence policy, interventions, and pro-
gramming is through research guided by a socio-
ecological framework (Sallis et al. 2006). We thus
envisioned this active collaboration between re-
searchers, policy makers, and knowledge users as a
valuable component of integrated knowledge trans-
lation in our work, helping to set the stage for our
research findings to resonate in practice or policy
decisions (Kothari and Wathen 2013).
The maps used for the exercises were based on
high resolution satellite imagery and printed in
large format (122cm  91cm) at a scale of 1:2500. In
each group, the researcher and community member
used the maps to guide the children through
discussions covering: (1) places they enjoy/like on
their journey to and from school; (2) places they
dislike or that make them feel unsafe; and (3) places
or areas they would like to see improved. For each of
these topics, children were given different coloured
stickers to place on the map and extensive notes
were taken detailing what children chose to discuss
at these locations.
We opted for two dimensional (2-D) mapping for
multiple reasons. With this research coinciding with
Geography Awareness Week, it was important that
the process also provide educational benefits
promoting geography as a discipline. The use of
2-D maps allowed students the opportunity to
interact, read, and engage with maps of their local
environments. As well, the participatory mapping
exercise allowed a large number of students to
112–128



engage with the research process, which suited our
classroom-based approach. Furthermore, past re-
search using creative in-depth participatory meth-
ods, such as child-guided walks and group photo
elicitation, recommends the addition of a compo-
nent similar to our participatory mapping exer-
cises, where children are provided the opportunity
to visually record their neighbourhood experien-
ces (Loebach and Gilliland 2010). Finally, this
technique helped to include multiple voices
through the visualization of children’s spatial
knowledge.


Analysis
Analysis was completed using a thematic analytic
approach to systematically identify patterns and
themes in the data (Braun and Clarke 2006).
Recordings were transcribed verbatim by one
researcher and verified by an alternative research
assistant present at the map-based focus groups to
ensure accuracy. All 25 transcripts were entered
into NVivo 11 Pro qualitative software for analysis.
We followed a multi-step coding process (Braun and
Clarke 2006). First, we separated data by school, to
allow for consideration of urban and suburban
differences. Next, we grouped data into categories
based on environmental features that students
“Like,” “Dislike,” “Want Improved,” and “Stop,” as
well as tracking key quotes. We then used the coding
stripes feature in NVivo to visually delineate domi-
nant areas of interest within transcripts along with
the “nodes most frequently coded” feature, to
identify topics most frequently discussed. Through
this process, we identified three main themes in the
dataset that aligned with our study objectives to
better understand children’s perceptions of the
features in their environments that are barriers/
enablers along their school journeys.
This experiential data about children’s school
journeys was integrated with geospatial data using
qualitative GIS techniques. We drew on Knigge and
Cope’s (2006) approach to visualization, which
refers to methods that provide insight into geo-
graphic data through visual representation. Follow-
ing our identification of frequently discussed topics
through our textual thematic analysis, we geo-coded
(i.e., matched geographic XY coordinates) all loca-
tions marked by participants with stickers on the
large-scale satellite view aerial maps. Unique ID
codes were created for each point and these were
ographe canadien 2019,
The Canadian Geographer / Le Ge
Children’s perspectives on active school travel  117
then matched and joined in ArcMap 10.4 and
connected with the children’s own descriptions of
and comments about these places. The points layer
was added in ArcMap and then the kernel density
function tool was used to calculate and display the
density of features (enablers, barriers, and improve-
ments) in the neighbourhoods surrounding the
schools. Areas of high mention by students appear
darker in colour and areas of no mention remain
transparent. This spatial analysis reveals both high
and low areas of interest to students at both school
locations. The resultant hot spot maps allow
visualization of key locations of interest, concern,
and potential improvements for all participating
schools. Key student quotes are reported in the
results and have been linked (with corresponding
letters) to their corresponding hotspots on the
maps. These individual quotes are provided to be
illustrative of the types of experiences children
attached to these places, while the use of hot spot
maps represents the overall collective nature of the
map-based activities, foregrounding the group
experience.


Study schools: Neighbourhood characteristics
The two school neighbourhoods varied consider-
ably in their environmental characteristics (Figures
1 and 2). Some of the key differences between
these two contrasting school locations included
street layout, surrounding green space, and built
environment features. The surrounding neigh-
bourhood at the suburban school contained
many looping and non-connecting cul-de-sac
streets (Figure 1). Cul-de-sac streets tend to
promote lower traffic volume surrounding the
school. Larger, busier intersections can be seen
along the borders of the map. Another unique
environmental feature of this school is the large
forest located directly behind the school, which is
attached to the schoolyard. The students at this
school self-identified as being primarily walkers.
On the other hand, the neighbourhood around the
urban school (Figure 2) contains a grid-iron street
typology, a largely non-hierarchical network asso-
ciated with more evenly distributed traffic flow
across streets throughout the area. Another dis-
tinct characteristic is close proximity to a set of
train tracks and the downtown core. The students
at this school identified as being predominantly
bussers.

Results

We identified three main themes: safety-related
features, material features, and affective features.
Our analysis revealed overlap between urban and
suburban children’s perceived barriers, enablers,
and improvements on their journey to and from
school. We thus report on the schools jointly,
indicating which area selected quotes pertain to

Safety-related features
Children emphasized safety as an important part
of their school journey experience. Interactions
with people while travelling to school were

particularly important enabling features, especially
the familiarity of people, travelling to school with
friends, and walking with a sibling—as one student
from the suburban school commented, “I feel more
comfortable when my friends walk with me and
talk and stuff” (Figure 3, A). Seeing familiar faces
en route and stopping at a friend’s house to travel
together were the two most common safety-
supporting features students identified. Many
students consciously selected certain routes to
encounter other students, including one child who
liked their walking route to their suburban school

because “I feel safe going this way cuz like a lot of
it’s in a row with like five kids that I know”
(Figure 3, B). Crossing guards were another signifi-
cant safety-supporting feature, as one student at
the urban school put it, “I usually feel safer walking
that way because there’s a crossing guard there”
(Figure 4, C). Children perceived crossing guards’
presence and capacity to calm traffic along their
route as beneficial.
Safety-related barriers included challenges cross-
ing the road, traffic, and busy streets. Crossing the
street,    regardless    of    the    neighbourhood

infrastructure, often raised safety concerns for
students. These centred on negative experiences
with specific traffic lights, distractedness and

impatience of drivers, and simply not enjoying the

act of crossing the street. One student explained

crossing the street near the urban school as “super

busy in the mornings. A lot of people—I actually

almost got hit there. I had the right of way and

someone came drifting. I think they could put a stop
light there instead of having it as an intersection”
(Figure 4, D). Another student shared similar feel-
ings of aversion towards crossing the street while

actively travelling to their suburban school, explain-
ing that,

It’s the crosswalk right by my, um, house I don’t like it

because, um, cars, they, usually when I’m rollerblad-

ing to school, the cars don’t, um, stop, and they don’t

look, so, um, I don’t, I just don’t feel safe when I’m

going across, and, and when there’s cars stopping,

because they don’t, some cars don’t stop. (Figure 3, E)

The volume of cars, traffic speed, and noise
generated by traffic made students feel unsafe and
apprehensive on their journey, with many students

making statements such as, “I’m scared of the traffic”
(Figure 3, F); “I don’t like it here because there are
usually a lot of cars” (Figure 3, G); and “It’s hazardo
right here because there are tons of cars and a lot of
kids walking” (Figure 3, H). Features that presented
hazardous road scenarios created a sense of insecu-
rity. One student summed up the general perception
of most participants from both schools, when
exclaiming, “Ya I don’t like crossing” (Figure 3, I).
While children deemed interactions with familiar
people (e.g., neighbours, friends, siblings) to be
enabling features of their school journeys, other

interactions piqued safety concerns. People on their
journeys who they perceived as risky were unfamil-
us                iar people, teenagers, and bullies. The presence of
“creepy”—a word several students used—people
negatively influenced children’s perceptions of
certain areas, decreasing feelings of safety. When
asked to expand ideas about barriers to personal
safety, statements such as “The creepy dude!”
(Figure 4, J) were made, revealing that children
qualified certain areas on their route by past
interactions with people (Crawford et al. 2017).
Some children at the suburban school explained

122    Wilson et al.
that they would avoid walking a particular route
because they knew teenagers or bullies would be
there and it made them feel scared: “I don’t like that
place right there because um, there’s these teen-
agers that go there a lot” (Figure 3, K) and “We’re
always kind of cautious, there’s a boy and his
brother and one time we got really scared because
they were standing behind the fence that’s covered
in leaves and they jumped out at us” (Figure 3, L).
In terms of improvement, many children identi-
fied the influence of parents over their travel as an
area where they would like to see changes made.
While many children expressed feelings of complete
safety walking to school, they noted it was their
parents’ perspectives of safety stopping them from
being able to walk to school. Also, many students
felt as if their parents did not believe they were
responsible or old enough to walk alone. Conse-
quently, many of these children were either driven
(car or bus), or had to walk with either a sibling or a
friend.


Material features
Children discussed pedestrian-friendly infrastruc-
ture such as sidewalks, stop signs, short travel
distance, and short cuts as enablers on their
journeys to school. Children also valued not having
to cross the street to travel on a sidewalk, as
opposed to streets with sidewalks on only one
side of the road—as a student at the suburban
school said, “I like how there is a sidewalk there”
(Figure 3, M). Stop signs were also a positively
viewed feature on children’s journeys because of
their role in decreasing traffic speed: one student
commented, “I like how there is a stop sign right
here because it slows down the cars” (Figure 4, N).
Although these features often evoked feelings of
safety, both sidewalks and stop signs are catego-
rized as material feature enablers since they were
largely discussed in relation to their physical
presence in the environment rather than the feel-
ings they facilitated when encountered by children.
Short travel distance was discussed by students at
both schools as an enabler to walking to school,
especially by students who lived within close
proximity to the school. When asked to explain
their route to school one student’s initial response
at the urban school was, “Not that long, I just have to
cross the street so it’s pretty simple for me”
(Figure 4, O). Finally, children cited shortcuts as
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):
The Canadian Geographer / Le Ge

supportive of AST. At the suburban school, habits
such as cutting through the forest, creating or
following pathways in the woods, and hopping a
fence to shorten the distance to school were among
a few of the shortcuts students created and enjoyed
using on their route to school. Similarly, students at
the urban school would take detours and shortcuts
through nearby parks.
Material barriers to AST related to sidewalks,
weather, distance, terrain, drop-off zones, and
trains. As per above, streets that lacked sidewalks,
or only had sidewalks on one side of the street, were
seen as barriers. In fact, any areas which required
additional street crossing were viewed as unfav-
ourable and areas lacking a sidewalk altogether
made children feel as if there was no protection
from vehicles. When sidewalks were not available,
children were forced to travel on the roadside. One
student at the suburban school stated, “I don’t feel
safe because there’s no other sidewalks in this area”
(Figure 3, P). Inclement weather also interfered with
children’s school journeys. Top weather-related
barriers included rain (walking was uncomfortable),
ice on stairs (fears of injury), and a lack of snow
clearing on both pathways and sidewalks (fears of
injury in conjunction with potentially limiting a
route(s) to school). Distance was another barrier; the
farther a student’s house was from the school, the
more it was prioritized as a barrier to AST. Hilly
terrain further complicated the distance barrier;
however, hills were mostly seen as a barrier to
students biking to school, rather than those walk-
ing. As one student said, “we don’t want to bike
down because it’s hard to go up so sometimes we’ll
just drop him [a friend] off at the top of the hill so we
don’t have to ride back up” (Figure 3, Q).
Drop-off zones and school parking lots were
viewed by children as dangerous, chaotic, and
hazardous, particularly in the morning due to the
sheer volume of traffic. Those at the suburban
school mentioned that many streets lacked proper
lighting, which worsened in the winter months
when the walk to and from school was very dark
and could be hazardous, overlapping with the
safety theme. Trains were an environmental bar-
rier identified at both school locations; however,
they were more frequently mentioned at the urban
school, likely due to train crossings in close
proximity to the school location. In fact, many
students crossed the railroad tracks on their daily
journey to school. Students also took issue with
112–128



the time it took for the crossing train to pass if
they were stopped at the rail barrier, the speed at
which trains travel, the inconvenience, and a
general dislike—as one student simply stated, “I
would like there not to be a train” (Figure 4, R).
The majority of improvements identified by
students were to mitigate the aforementioned
barriers; however, there were a few features not
previously discussed. For one, children noted the
need for a pathway in an area that did not have one
or improvements to an existing pathway. One
student at the suburban school explained, “I don’t
feel like I’m safe, like it [the pathway] can get pretty
crammed and sometimes if there’s strollers you
have to walk around them” (Figure 3, S). Many
students brought up ideas on how to improve their
crossing of the train tracks, but most of these
suggestions required large-scale infrastructure
changes, such as the addition of a bridge or tunnel,
or removal of the train tracks entirely.


Affective features
Children identified a series of affective features
along their school journeys that influenced their
moods, feelings, and attitudes in relation to their
perceptions of their environments. Trees, parks,
interactions with crossing guards, AST programs,
and dogs were among the most common features
discussed by children that evoked positive affec-
tive responses. Students enjoyed seeing trees
lining the streets because “[i]t gives off a lot of
shade” (Figure 3, T). Others found trees in the
suburban neighbourhood to be aesthetically pleas-
ing: “It has a big tree in front of it and it looks so
beautiful and the leaves change colour and I just
like to stop and stare” (Figure 3, U). The suburban
school and its surrounding neighbourhoods are
unique because of the large forest located directly
behind the school. Many students altered their
routes to “avoid the road so I cut through the
forest” (Figure 3, V) and because they enjoyed it. As
one student explained, “Um well we usually just
like going in the woods because it’s nice and
there’s lots of animals and stuff” (Figure 3, W).
Around the urban school, with a high density of
parks, a number of students made detours en
route to school to walk through a park and make
their journey more enjoyable: “[W]ell, sometimes I
take detours. I’ll go there to the park and come out
the back” (Figure 4, X).
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):
The Canadian Geographer / Le Ge
Children’s perspectives on active school travel     123
Crossing guards also served an enabling role as
positive affective features of the journey-to-school
environment. Children at both the urban and
suburban schools not only appreciated crossing
guards for the safety reasons above, but also
enjoyed the recognition and personal interactions
with these familiar faces: “I like seeing the crossing
guard because she’s nice” (Figure 4, Y). School-based
programs, such as a walking school bus, were also
seen as enablers: “[I] like the walking school bus, I
like the people and I like where it goes (Figure 4, Z).”
A few students also mentioned encountering dogs
en route as a positive experience. One student at the
urban school stated, “Sometimes I see this really
cute little English Bull Dog on my way to school. It is
usually on the other side of the street” (Figure 4, AA).
Students were clear about features at certain
locations that induced negative feelings on their
route to school. Absence of crossing guards and
presence of dogs, garbage, and smoking were the top
affective negative influences children encountered
on their school journeys. Children only saw crossing
guards, or lack thereof, as a barrier when the
crossing guard did not assist in crossing the street
and when one was not present at high-traffic areas.
This translated into children seeing the addition of a
crossing guard in certain locations as an area of
improvement to their school journey. Students
suggested several additional locations where they
would like to have assistance crossing the street,
with many students believing this addition would
make their journey safer, faster, and more enjoyable.
Although a somewhat contested feature, dogs were
more commonly seen as a barrier by students and
often produced negative emotional responses. Stu-
dents at both schools shared similar feelings
towards dogs, including comments such as, “There’s
like dogs there and they’ve bitten people before so I
don’t like taking that way and the owners don’t really
take care of them” (Figure 3, BB) and “My neighbour,
they have this, like, really crazy dog, it’s kind of
creepy, it, like usually they keep it in their car
sometimes” (Figure 3, CC).
Several material features contributed to the
affective landscape of children’s school journeys.
Garbage negatively influenced children’s percep-
tions of their environments. Participants discussed
displaced garbage, such as dog waste and litter, as a
negative feature that they have to encounter while
travelling to and from school: “There’s a lot of
garbage in the area and cigarette butts so like it’s not
112–128


124    Wilson et al.
very good for kids to be around” (Figure 3, DD) and
“People don’t clean up after their dogs and then
there’s just like everywhere dog poop everywhere
because people don’t clean up after their dogs”
(Figure 3, EE). Children at the urban school in
particular often made comments to the effect of
“There’s a lot of garbage that needs to be cleaned
up” (Figure 4, FF). Finally, children disliked having to
pass people smoking on their travels to school,
often classifying certain locations as smoking areas
where people were known to smoke cigarettes.
Children would try to avoid these locations on their
route to school, such as one near the river in the
urban area—“there’s a ton of people that smoke, and
it smells like smoke and it looks deserted and it’s
really dirty” (Figure 4, GG). Likewise, a number of
students noted that the littering of cigarette butts
detracted from their school journey experience, “I
don’t like the road because there’s so much
cigarettes on them” (Figure 3, HH). These affective
features led some students to negatively categorize
certain segments of their school journeys.
When it came to improvements, students pointed
to buildings along their journeys that provoked
feelings of insecurity. Students at the urban school
were more likely to speak of houses that appeared to
be deteriorating, such as “There’s a place that looks
pretty abandoned near my house” (Figure 4, II) and
“[T]here’s a house that I think needs improvement”
(Figure 4, JJ), and “Some of the houses here are
messy and not nice” (Figure 4, KK). For some
students these scenes elicited strong emotional
reactions. For example, one student from the urban
school said, “This one apartment is really sketchy.
There are a lot of people there that aren’t good and
are dangerous. My parents don’t like me walking by
there” (Figure 4, LL). Another urban student ex-
plained the fear tied to a particular house on their
school journey “because it is kind of creepy when
you pass it and it’s all dark” (Figure 4, MM). This
reaffirms the notion that even though an area or
feature might be objectively safe, if a child perceives
it as a barrier it can influence the experience of their
school journey and how they choose to travel.


Discussion and conclusion

By positioning children as experts of their environ-
ments in our participatory methodology, our
findings provide an important counterpoint to
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):
The Canadian Geographer / Le Ge

the adultist privilege characterizing the majority
of research on children’s AST. The themes we
identified—safety-related, material, and affective
features—demonstrate that the barriers and ena-
blers children experience on their school journeys
are not only multi-layered, but have multiple mean-
ings from children’s perspectives. It became evident
from our results that a physical feature in children’s
environments is simply not just that—children
perceive that feature to have other meanings,
implications, and influences on their journeys to
and from school. The maps created through our
qualitative GIS show the places that these students
use every day and what they perceive to be
important based on their spatial knowledge. We
thus argue that identifying barriers and enablers to
AST for children requires engaging children’s views
—otherwise opportunities for intervention will be
missed. Take, for example, the role of crossing
guards. Not only did crossing guards constitute an
important safety-related feature, but they signifi-
cantly coloured the affective landscape of children’s
school journeys.
Indeed, one of the unique findings of our study
was the significance of affective features, both as
enablers and barriers to AST. The diversity of
affective encounters described by the children we
spoke with echoes the research of Murray and Mand
(2013) on children’s mobile emotions in everyday
travel. They reported that children’s affective
situations spanned a myriad of sometimes con-
trasting qualities, observing that “the disgust of
‘dog poo’ on the way to school is experienced
alongside the joy in finding a new short-cut” (Murray
and Mand 2013, 73). Interventions would benefit
from taking into account this varied affective
topography to incorporate features that support a
positive affective landscape along children’s school
journeys.
In light of the socio-ecological framework, at the
intra- and inter-personal levels our findings diverge
in two ways from the AST literature that is based
primarily on parental data. First, the AST literature
frequently cites parental fears of child abduction as
a key barrier for children walking to and from
school, despite actual risk being lower compared to
other risks such as automobile collisions, pedes-
trian injuries, and bicycle injuries (Eichelberger et al.
1990; Ahlport et al. 2008). In contrast, our study
shows that from children’s perspectives, “stranger
danger” is not a common theme; in fact, many map-
112–128



based focus groups never brought up the topic.
Although children, particularly the urban students,
did mention people they deemed to be “sketchy,”
the intra- and inter-personal factors children em-
phasized most were interactions with friends,
crossing guards, and neighbours. Second, while
walking to school with other children may alleviate
parental concerns (Salmon et al. 2007), our research
shows that from children’s perspectives, walking to
school with other children and friends was an
affective feature enabler.
In terms of the environmental sphere of the socio-
ecological framework, both the natural and built
environments were dominant aspects in our material
features theme. Several modifiable environmental
features surfaced during the participatory mapping
exercises, such as sidewalks, drop-off zones, and
pedestrian infrastructure (e.g., crosswalks, street
lights, stop signs). Children believed that improving
the infrastructure in the neighbourhoods surround-
ing their schools would facilitate AST. Our findings
are consistent with those of Boarnet et al. (2005) who
found that improvements to sidewalks and traffic
control systems are promising in relation to impact-
ing the propensity of children walking and biking to
school. Creating or improving neighbourhood routes
(e.g., paths, shortcuts, walkways) that allow children
to avoid travelling along major arteries and crossing
busy intersections could also serve to facilitate
increased walking (Clark et al. 2016).
Several of the safety-related features raised by
participants tie in with the policy sphere of the
socio-ecological framework. These features largely
related to the availability of crossing guards, school-
based programs, drop-off zones, and school loca-
tion. Crossing guards were an especially significant
policy-relevant feature mentioned by many stu-
dents as safety and affective enablers of their school
journeys. Regulations determine the locations and
numbers of crossing guards in school neighbour-
hoods. Students at both schools preferred having a
crossing guard at an intersection rather than an un-
staffed crosswalk. In the city this research was
completed in, crossing guards fall under the
jurisdiction of a private security company con-
tracted out by the city’s roadway, lighting, and
traffic control division, regulated under the provin-
cial Ontario Highway Traffic Act. The city reviews
other municipalities’ school crossing guard practi-
ces and uses a warrant system to evaluate all
existing and new crossing guard locations. In the
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):
The Canadian Geographer / Le Ge
Children’s perspectives on active school travel   125
future, when cities review past and present crossing
guard locations, it would be a beneficial practice for
them to discuss potential locations with students at
the affected school(s). Likewise, drop-off zones, as
discussed within our safety theme, are guided by
policy. Many children raised concerns about the
volume of traffic and lack of safety within their
school drop-off zone. The infrastructure of the
drop-off zone largely influenced children’s percep-
tions of their journeys, particularly when they
travelled through or past this area. One student
explained that an improvement could be made by
changing this area to a one-way zone for traffic, in
order to reduce the “chaos” of the drop-off zone.
Interventions aimed at increasing AST can be both
informally driven by students or implemented at the
organizational level. Many students mentioned that
they would stop at friends’ houses on their way to
school, pick them up, and then continue to walk to
school together. Having students find a friend or
classmate to walk to school with is an effective self-
driven way to engage more students in AST. At an
organizational level, schools could look to implement
a walking school bus program (Kearns et al. 2003).
Another organizational level intervention for adapta-
tion could be the implementation of a Walk Safely to
School Day campaign or iWalk day (Green Communi-
ties Canada 2010). Both of these are annual events
hosted by schools on a specific day that promote AST
and allow the school community to tailor an event to
specific features of individual schools while encour-
aging AST to the entire school population.
One of the key contributions of our study is the
novel participatory methodology we employed to
elicit rich, in-depth insight into children’s percep-
tions about the environmental factors shaping their
experiences of AST. This methodology embraces the
understanding that young people possess expert
knowledge about their environments. The maps
created during our study show the places that these
students use every day and what they perceive to be
important based on their spatial knowledge. The
collaborative nature of this research is a major
strength of its design. This was an interactive
program run during Geography Awareness Week,
with equal attention given to educating the children
about the importance of the research they were
completing. The project went beyond simply being a
research project and was used as an opportunity to
educate grade five and six students about geogra-
phy as a discipline and the daily influence of their
112–128


126    Wilson et al.
surrounding environments. Furthermore, it gave
children the opportunity to speak directly to experts
and policy makers about improvements they would
like to see on their journeys to and from school.
The inclusion of community stakeholders in our
research process provided the opportunity to
engage decision makers in understanding children’s
perceptions of features influencing children’s jour-
ney to and from school. We suggest this approach
lays the groundwork for linking our qualitative
findings to policy interventions down the road by
offering community stakeholders first-hand—
rather than abstract—engagement with children’s
perspectives and increases buy-in from an inte-
grated knowledge translation perspective. The
experience of “being in the room” while the mapping
and discussion was ongoing offers a level of context
to AST evidence that local policy stakeholders may
not have otherwise been afforded. Our engagement
with integrated knowledge translation in this
research advances development of the necessary
relationship between researchers and policy makers
working collaboratively in mutually beneficial re-
search toward changes in practices (Kothari and
Wathen 2013). It is these types of research methods,
amplifying children’s voices, that can help to inform
policy and practice supporting localized interven-
tions aimed at increasing children’s AST.
At the same time, moving forward, future re-
search and interventions for AST must adopt an
equity lens to ensure that we do not inadvertently
exacerbate existing health and social inequities
(Frohlich and Potvin 2008; Coen 2017). Our findings
are an important starting point for bringing child-
ren’s experiences into AST research; however, we
recognize that children’s independent mobilities,
AST behaviours, and physical activity participation
more broadly are characterized by gendered and
other social disparities (McMillan et al. 2006;
Janssen et al. 2011; Villanueva et al. 2013). We
hold that the next steps in this line of inquiry are to
explore the gendered dimensions of AST experi-
ences, as well as how these intersect with other axes
of social difference. This requires child-centred
research designs that contend with children’s
first-hand perceptions of the structures (e.g., gen-
der, ethnicity, SES, (dis)ability) at play in affording
AST opportunities, as well as children’s embodied
experiences of AST. Creative methods, building on
the participatory mapping approach we have taken
here, can be a way forward to further recognize
ographe canadien 2019, 63(1):

children’s agency and connect research findings to
public health agendas from an integrated knowl-
edge translation perspective (Parsons and Boydell
2012; Parsons et al. 2013; Coen 2017).
Several limitations qualify our findings. First,
selection and recruitment of schools was based on
the availability of the schools and their interest in
the research. In the future, it would be valuable to
explore a broader range of school neighbourhoods,
including those in rural and remote settings.
Children living in less densely populated areas are
likely to have diverse influences on AST such as
longer commuting distances, compared to children
living in urban and suburban settings similar to the
participants involved in this research (Dalton et al.
2011). Second, in order to encompass all of the
children’s voices in the research and understand
their perspectives of their school neighbourhoods,
findings were coded across all students, regardless
of the mode of travel students use to get to and from
school. During the mapping exercises children
indicated their most common mode of travel,
showing that half of the participants use a form of
AST and half use a form of non-active travel. This
shows that many children perceive similar features
to influence active school journeys, regardless of
how they personally travel to school. Third, and
related to our equity discussion above, due to the
collective classroom nature of our data collection
strategy grouping students according to neighbour-
hood, we were not able to probe any differences in
experiences along various dimensions of social
difference. Although we recognize the role gender
plays in children’s independent mobility, the pur-
pose of this research aimed to gain broad insight
into children’s environmental perceptions related
to AST; our analysis therefore, did not explicitly
query gendered aspects of these experiences.
Rather, our study provided an overall basis of
children’s experiences with AST that provides a
foundation for future work that will unpack gen-
dered and other structures that also shape how
children journey to and from school.
In conclusion, findings from our participatory
mapping and qualitative GIS identified safety-
related, material, and affective features of child-
ren’s local environments as barriers and enablers to
AST from children’s perspectives. These barriers
and enablers transected all four levels of the socio-
ecological framework. Although the two schools
varied in geographical setting, results from our
