increases. Moreover, a wide range of policy-sensitive variables along with their effect magnitude was
discussed and compared with the previous studies. The results showed that one percent increase in the
probability of walking to school is expected for every 0.04 percent increase in auto travel time, 0.07

ship, 0.03 percent increase in distance to public transit, or 2.37 percent decrease in commute distance.

students' gender, age, and vehicle ownership have been widely
used, while other important variables such as travel time, cost,
comfort, and speci<U+FB01>cations of the transit system have received a
limited attention. There are comprehensive reviews (Panter et al.,
2008; Pont et al., 2009; Ding et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2011) of the
past studies that compared in<U+FB02>uential factors of active school
travel. Furthermore, a review of the analysis method shows that
descriptive analysis and binary logit models are predominantly
used to explain school travel modes, while very few studies have
implemented multinomial logit (MNL) models to explain this be-
havior. We found very occasional attempts (Ewing et al., 2004)
that tried to develop more advanced econometric models (e.g. a
nested logit speci<U+FB01>cation), but the outputs was unsuccessful in

practice.


The current literature has certain gaps that have motivated this
research. First, many previous studies (Mitra et al., 2010; McMillan,

2007) distinguishes between only two alternatives with binary



choice models. Although this approach simpli<U+FB01>es the modeling


methodology, the results provide a vivid picture of school travel
modal split that limits applicability of the <U+FB01>ndings. Second, a few

studies (Ewing et al., 2004; McDonald, 2008a) that distinguishes

between multiple travel modes, have potential model mis-

speci<U+FB01>cation issues. This is because IIA (independence of irrelevant

alternatives) property of MNL is not intuitively acceptable in

school mode choice decisions, unless a very wide range of ex-

planatory variables reduces the effect of correlated unobserved

factors. IIA property implies that characteristics of a third alter-

native (say school busing) do not change the relative odds be-

tween the two alternatives (say walking and driving). This is an
inappropriate assumption, since IIA of the MNL model indicates
that likelihood of taking a school bus and having the kid walk

alone would increase proportionally, if the parents cannot drive
their kids to school. This is, intuitively, not true, as parents who

take a school bus and those who ride their kids to school could

have similar safety reservations and therefore, taking a school bus

seems more probable when they cannot drive the kids to school.

Lastly, parents have reservations about their kids’ travel method,

including safety, comfort, and reliability, that are expected to in-

<U+FB02>uence students’ mode choice decisions. These variables have re-

ceived very limited attention in previous models that leads to a

form of missing variable model misspeci<U+FB01>cation.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, the mod-
eling methodology is brie<U+FB02>y reviewed, followed by a description of
the empirical data that is collected for this purpose. The estimation
results of a three level nested logit (NL) model is, then, presented
and analyzed from a policy perspective. Finally, the paper con-
cludes with a summary and recommendations for future research.


2. Method

A multinomial logit model has a closed form formula and a
straightforward estimation method. However, assumption of IID
(independently and identically distributed) extreme value error
terms induces certain limitations that are discussed in details by
Train (2009). IIA property of MNL is the primary consequence of
IID assumption, which is intuitively unacceptable in many cases;
unless all the unobserved factors that make the error terms de-
pendent, explicitly enter the model (Train, 2009). The NL model
speci<U+FB01>cation, an extension of MNL, was introduced by Ben-Akiva
and Lerman (1985) to capture correlation among alternatives to
some extents. Although IIA is maintained within each nest, it is
relaxed to IIN (independence of irrelevant nests) for alternatives in
different nests. This allows variance of errors to differ across the

The utility that student j perceives from travel mode i is the
sum of a systematic utility (Vji) and an error term. The probability
of choosing each mode is given by Eq. (1) (Coldren and Koppel-
man, 2005), assuming a linear-in-parameter function of ex-
planatory variables for the systematic utility and maximizing the
likelihood of occurrence for the sampled observations. In this
equation, subscript n is omitted for ease of representation, Pm is
the probability of choosing an upper-level nest (limb), Pn|m is the
conditional probability of choosing a lower-level nest (branch)
given a limb, Pi|n and is the conditional probability of choosing
an alternative given a branch. µ is the inverse logsum parameter,
also known as the coef<U+FB01>cient of inclusive value (IV). tn and
tm are, respectively, given by tn = ln( <U+2211>i`<U+2208> N exp(µn Vi`)) and

NL models may be estimated either sequentially or simulta-

neously. The <U+FB01>rst estimation method is termed limited informa-

tion maximum likelihood (LIML), and the latter is known as full

information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation. Although

FIML estimation is more challenging and one may encounter

convergence problems, Hensher (1986) showed that LIML provides

statistically inef<U+FB01>cient estimates for a NL model. Therefore, a FIML

estimation method is adopted to obtain consistent, asymptotically

normal, and ef<U+FB01>cient estimates.



3. Data


To study school trip mode choice decisions, three folds of data

were obtained: students’ travel information, household demo-

graphics, and transportation and built-environment character-

istics. The data was obtained for Tehran, with an area of 700 km2, a

population of 7.5 million, and 620 traf<U+FB01>c analysis zones. Around 15

million daily trips are made in Tehran, 27 percent of which are

educational (Municipality of Tehran, 2006). There were 5352

schools and 1,119,571 registered k-12 students in Tehran in 2010
(Statistics of Minister of Education, 2012). Public schools have a
dominant share and are mainly funded by the government.
Therefore, the administrations are relatively more under the in-
<U+FB02>uence of the government. Private schools, on the other hand,
have a higher academic quality and very costly in some cases.
Public schools, as opposed to private schools, are “zoned schools”
meaning that only those who live in a designated area could be
registered. We observed a range of 60 m to just about 10 km for
the commute distance to school in Tehran.
A paper-based survey was conducted in May 2011, targeting
4900 middle-school and high-school students throughout Tehran.
Primary school students were not covered, as the literature (Panter
et al., 2008; McMillan, 2005) suggests a relatively different mode
choice decision making process for them. A strati<U+FB01>ed random
sample was taken based on gender and level of education, since
schools are gender-segregated in Iran. Further, parents were asked
to <U+FB01>ll out the questionnaires, because they have more precise in-
formation about household demographics and in<U+FB02>uence on stu-
dents’ choice of travel mode (McMillan, 2005). The survey had a
response rate of 72 percent, and collected information on <U+FB01>ve
folds: 1) household socio demographics (e.g. household size, in-
come, education, vehicle ownership, working status of parents), 2)
student characteristics (e.g. age, gender, grade), 3) built-environ-
ment attributes (e.g. walk time to school, access to public transit,
commuting to or from a restricted traf<U+FB01>c zone), 4) school trip

behaviors (e.g. escort pattern, primary mode of travel, travel cost,
and trip chain), and 5) parental reservations about school trips
(e.g. safety, reliability, duration, and comfort).
Four modes of travel are considered in this study: walk, auto
drive, school bus, and public transportation. Travel time and cost
of auto and transit is essential for a mode choice study and was
obtained from Tehran Comprehensive Transportation and Traf<U+FB01>c
Studies Company (TCTTS) (2012). TCTTS estimated travel cost and
time from an EMME2 model that was recalibrated in 2010. Travel
time of the walking mode, on the other hand, was asked in the
survey and double checked with the commute distance. Bike mode
was not considered, since less than 1 percent of students reported
to use bicycles for school trips. Share of each mode, classi<U+FB01>ed by
gender, school level, and commute distance is illustrated in Fig. 1.
This <U+FB01>gure also illustrates the relationship between parental con-
cerns and share of active modes among genders. Fig. 1(a) shows
that girls are more inclined, in general, toward walking to school.
However, as per Fig. 1(b), commute distance is negatively

correlated with walking. Further, Fig. 1(c) and (d), respectively,
shows the share of active travel modes for girls and boys. A de-
scriptive analysis of parental reservations reveals that 85 percent
of parents whose kids avoid active modes of travel are primarily
concerned travel safety.


4. Model

A three level NL model was developed in this study to explain
choice of school travel mode among walk, automobile, school bus,
and public transportation. Explanatory variables that are used to
model the choice situation are de<U+FB01>ned in Table 2 and estimation
results for MNL and NL models are reported in Table 3. The tree of
the NL model is structured in a way that the upper level has two
limbs that cleave into active and non-active limbs and the lower
level of the non-active limb divides into public and private bran-
ches (Fig. 2). The active limb and public branch have one
the nested logit model.

Moreover, a dummy variable (NON_AUTO) for households with no
private car indicates students from such families are, under-
standably, more likely to walk or take transit to school. Table 4
indicates that one percent increase in the family income reduces
likelihood of public transit use by 0.46 percent, and increase
chance of driving, walking, and riding on school bus, respectively,
by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.06 percent. In accordance with Martin et al.
(2007), however, a negative association between parental educa-
tion level and tendency to use AMT and public transportation was
found. This could be attributed either to the positive correlation
between income and education, or to the fact that educated par-
ents are more aware of potential risks that exist in walking and
taking transit.
Safety, comfort, reliability, and duration of the school trip,
along with the school or home being located in a limited traf<U+FB01>c

two factors had been explored in previous studies (McDonald and
Aalborg, 2009; McMillan, 2007), while the rest have received very
little (Samimi and Ermagun, 2012b; Ermagun et al., 2014), if any,
attention. According to Table 3, parents who are concerned about
their children’s safety are more reluctant to have their kids walk or

comfort of their kids are more willing to use the school bus or
personal vehicle. School bus is more appealing to those who seek a
reliable mode, and traf<U+FB01>c restrictions incline students toward
public transportation, walking, and school bus. As expected, par-
ents who are concerned about the duration of their kid's travel are
more willing to use a personal car.


6. Policy implementation

There are some policy sensitive variables in the model that
allows the city of<U+FB01>cials to understand possible ways of promoting
active school trips. These variables that include travel time, cost,
vehicle ownership, access to public transit, commute distance to
school, and students' safety are discussed in the following.
Auto travel time has a direct elasticity of  0.27, according to
Table 4. This indicates one percent increase in auto travel time
discourages parents from driving their kids to school by a prob-
ability of 0.27 percent. Further, this would result in a marginal
increase in the share of other modes. Probability of walking, riding
a school bus, and public transit, respectively, increases by 0.04, 0.1,
and 0.06 percent. A higher sensitivity of automobile mode to the
travel time that is arguably relative to congestion level is

transit modes. Therefore, a misspeci<U+FB01>cation bias slightly over
predicts share of students who walk to school instead of taking
transit, when access to the public transit system is decreased.
Commute distance to school is, arguably, the most prominent
factor that in<U+FB02>uence walking and biking to school. This parameter
has received a central attention in smart development of land-use,
and has the highest absolute value of elasticity in our model.
Previous studies (Fyhri et al., 2011; Larsen et al., 2009; Ewing et al
2004; Merom et al., 2006) have unanimously noted a negative
correlation between commute distance and use of active modes.
We also found a direct elasticity of  2.4 for walk time to school
that indicates every one percent increase in the students’ com-
mute distance discourages use of active modes by a probability of

2.4 percent. Urban planners argue that “sprawl school siting” can

intensify urban challenges and make the land-use patterns in-

ef<U+FB01>cient (Cole et al., 2010; Passmore, 2002). Some recent guide-

lines, on the other hand, in the United States required a minimum

of 30 acre plus one acre for every 100 high-school students
(Schlossberg et al., 2005). This type of regulation urges developers

to build schools in urban fringes, to acquire enough land and

minimize their costs. City planners, therefore, need to be aware of

the magnitude of such impacts and must have more contempla-

tion on such policies that discourage active modes of commute to

school. In Iran, on the other hands, public policies encourage

neighborhood schools, although regional private schools are also

growing. Results of the model also indicated a direct elasticity of

0.15 for population density in the active mode, and an indirect

elasticity of 0.15 in the other modes. MNL and NL models,

however, predict fairly similar results for this parameter.

Safety is an important concern of parents that is in<U+FB02>uential on

reducing the use of active travel modes. Our model shows that

addressing the safety concerns of parents could increase pro-

pensity of active commuting to school by around 60 percent. This

increase in the probability of walking is calculated setting the

continuous variables at average and discrete variables at their

mode. Therefore, planers need to study policies that increase

parents' perception about their kids' travel safety to school. Safe

Routes to School (McDonald and Aalborg, 2009; Staunton et al.,

2003) and Walk School Bus (Collins and Kearns, 2010; Staunton

et al., 2003; Engwicht, 1992) are implemented in the United States
to address parental safety concerns and improve share of active
modes among students.

7. Conclusion

This study was an effort to develop a three level nested logit
model to explain the behavioral aspects of school trip modal se-
lection. Understanding the motives behind such behaviors is es-
sential for city planners to promote active commuting to school.
This is deemed an opportunity to prevent many health issues that
are stimulated by a lack of physical activity during childhood.
Further, promoting active modes for school trips is an opportunity

to decrease the morning peak congestion and thereby mitigate
externalities of the transportation system. This study introduced a

three level nested logit, a well-grounded econometric model that

deals with strong assumptions of the multinomial logit speci<U+FB01>ca-
tion. Although there have been some efforts and recommenda-
tions (Ewing et al., 2004) for applying such a model speci<U+FB01>cation,

to the best of our knowledge, this is the <U+FB01>rst model that is in-
troduced to the literature of school trip mode choice. This study
looked at a wide range of explanatory variables and conducted an

in-depth analysis of the models. Particularly, we underscored the

signi<U+FB01>cance of model misspeci<U+FB01>cation in terms of policy outcomes.
For instance, elasticity analysis of the MNL model showed an

indirect elasticity of vehicle ownership of  0.13 in the MNL
model, while NL model provides different elasticities of 0.12,
 0.20, and  0.08, respectively for public, school bus, and walk
modes. This misspeci<U+FB01>cation results in overestimating the reduc-
tion in the share of students who walk to school when vehicle
ownership increases. A wide range of policy-sensitive variables
along with their effect magnitude was also discussed and com-
pared with the previous studies. Particularly, we found that one
.,        percent increase in the probability of walking to school is expected
by every 0.04 percent increase in auto travel time, 0.07 percent
increase in the normalized-to-income cost of driving, 0.08 percent
decrease in vehicle ownership, 0.03 percent increase in distance to
public transit, or 2.37 percent decrease in commute distance.

Safety was also found to be very in<U+FB02>uential on active commuting,

such that we found addressing the safety concern of parents could

increase propensity of active commuting to school by around 60

percent. Yet, this study has the following limitations that could be

possible avenues for future research.


Trips of students who take transit to school should be partially

considered as active (Morency et al., 2011), since they need to

walk to the nearest bus station. This could be addressed by

developing a cross nested logit model, and setting the public

transit option in the active limb as well as the non-active limb.

Built-environment variables such as density of green space,

school, sidewalk and other land-use variables that are expected

to promote walking trips were not utilized, due to unavail-

ability of disaggregate data.

School trips are the focus of this study, although walking could

be promoted in other trips such as shopping and recreational

trips.

A systematic taste variation for cost of travel is considered in

this study, while a mixed nested logit speci<U+FB01>cation allows for

accounting for a random taste variation. This is expected to

provide a more realistic analysis of pricing scenarios.

Evaluating latent variables to investigate travel behavior in

school trips is a useful attitude which is not included in the

current study. To consider latent variables and parental atti-

tudes for each concern more information is needed which were

not included in the dataset.
