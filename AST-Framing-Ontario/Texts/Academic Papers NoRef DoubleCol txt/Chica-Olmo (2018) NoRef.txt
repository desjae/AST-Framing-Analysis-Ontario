Granada, Spain. To achieve these aims, the regression-kriging method was used. The results indicated that the
Euclidean and the walking distances were the best predictors of the decision to walk to school. Spatial depen-
dence produced by some locational variables and spatial contagion among students was found to be moderate to
strong. In addition, the spatial range of this spatial dependence is approximately 1000 m to 1600 m. Regression-
kriging could be implemented in a geographic information system to determine the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of schools
and aid urban designers and planners in developing neighborhoods that support active modes of commuting.
Identifying the areas of in<U+FB02>uence is important for promoting active modes of transport by local governments.

of in<U+FB02>uence around the school, which may vary depending on the
particular locational factors of each area of the city, such as crime,
tra<U+FB03>c, the environment, urban design, socioeconomic characteristics,
and others.
As a result of these factors, the area of in<U+FB02>uence of schools need not
be necessarily circular but may form irregular polygons within which
the school is located. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have
investigated the e<U+FB00>ects of spatial dependence and distance between
households on travel mode choice and the presence of spatial dis-
tribution patterns (Mitra et al., 2010). In our study it has been assumed
that households located close to each other in a given geographic area
are a<U+FB00>ected by similar locational factors. These locational factors may
cause young people living in the same area to encourage others located
nearby to make similar transport mode choices, thus leading to the
presence of spatial autocorrelation. In addition, these variables are not
always easy to observe, measure or specify in a speci<U+FB01>c model. More-
over, since the decision to walk to school may depend on locational
factors, it could cause a contagion e<U+FB00>ect, which can have a major im-
pact on urban tra<U+FB03>c, environmental pollution and climate change, but
also provide substantial health bene<U+FB01>ts (de Hartog et al., 2010).

error. Geographical proximity can be measured by some type of phy-
sical distance (i.e., Euclidean, Manhattan, walking-network and
driving-network). Distance is a measure of the proximity between the
household and the school, but is also considered the main barrier to
walking to school (McDonald, 2007b) in addition to other environ-
mental variables such as crime and tra<U+FB03>c (Pont et al., 2009). The closer
the household and school are to each other, the greater the probability
that children will walk to school (Chillón et al., 2014). The Euclidean
distance and the Manhattan distance are two common and easy to
calculate measures for determining geographical proximity. The Eu-
clidean distance is the straight-line or “as the crow <U+FB02>ies” distance, while
the Manhattan distance is the sum of the horizontal and vertical com-
ponents of a right-angled triangle. Another measure of physical distance
is the shortest network distance on foot or by car (Apparicio et al.,
2008). Of the four types of distances addressed here to measure how
users perceive the concept of proximity, the Euclidean distance is the
shortest, whereas the driving distance is the longest due to the presence
of one-way roads and pedestrian streets (Fig. 1). Golledge and Hubert
discussed how the use of a Euclidean metric can be supported for the
construction of mental maps for interurban analysis (Golledge and
Hubert, 1982). The Euclidean, Manhattan and network distances and
time have been used to measure accessibility to health services
(Apparicio et al., 2017) and green space (Higgs et al., 2012), as well as
walking to green spaces, cycling to public high schools, driving to
health care services, and walking, cycling and driving to supermarkets
(Logan et al., 2017). In this paper, the Euclidean, Manhattan and
shortest network distance on foot and by car are used.

2.2. Spatial dependence in mode choice

Spatial dependence can be de<U+FB01>ned as the existence of a relationship
between what happens at a point of the plane and what happens else-
where (Anselin, 1988). Spatial dependence is also referred to as “spatial
autocorrelation” (Anselin and Rey, 1991), although the notion of spa-
tial autocorrelation is more limited than that of spatial dependence
(Anselin and Rey, 1991). In practice, both concepts are usually con-
sidered the same (Anselin, 1988; Anselin, 1999). However, in the
geostatistics and spatial statistics <U+FB01>elds, Cressie (1991) primarily used
the term “spatial dependence.” To clarify, in the current study, the term
“spatial autocorrelation” refers to a variable or model perturbations (in
the sense of Anselin and Bera, 1998, “as a moment of the joint dis-
tribution”) and the term “spatial dependence” is used when referring to
the phenomenon under study. The idea of spatial dependence is ex-
pressed in the First Law of Geography, which posits that “everything is
related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant
things” (Tobler, 1970).
In the case of transport mode choice, spatial dependence is expected
to occur among individuals who are neighbors, since the locational
variables, such as crime rates or tra<U+FB03>c, will have a similar e<U+FB00>ect on
decisions regarding the mode of ACS. For example, a low crime rate in
an area will positively in<U+FB02>uence the decision to walk in that area. In a
context of this type, a positive face-to-face spatial contagion is also
expected, since neighboring individuals will tend to make similar de-
cisions. Thus, for example, if an individual decides to walk to school,
this can in<U+FB02>uence their neighbors directly (positive contagion), al-
though it could also have an additional indirect e<U+FB00>ect (negative con-
tagion). However, because both locational variables and contagion are
often unobservable, they are omitted in the models.
The concept of spatial dependence has been addressed in di<U+FB00>erent
<U+FB01>elds such as ecology, forestry, geology, medical, urban demography
and land use, among others (Anselin and Bera, 1998). These authors
also highlight that spatial dependence is due to certain misspeci<U+FB01>ca-
tions which result in spatial measurement errors and spatial auto-
correlation between the perturbances. In this line, Dubin (1988) found
that omitted variables will be included in the error term, causing this
term to be spatially autocorrelated. On the other hand, Galster et al.

Journal of Transport Geography 72 (2018) 1–12
(2001) explored a wide variety of concepts related to the land use
patterns (i.e., density, centrality, contiguity, continuity, etc.) that ex-
plain the level of sprawl, which might be related to the concept of
spatial dependence.
However, few studies have addressed the spatial interaction e<U+FB00>ects
that in<U+FB02>uence children's transport mode choice. These e<U+FB00>ects may occur
because households share common unobserved factors (Sidharthan
et al., 2011) that depend on the location and are di<U+FB03>cult to observe,
measure and specify in a model. These factors could be spatially au-
tocorrelated due to spatial interaction in two ways: across spatial zones,
neighborhoods or blocks and across individual behaviors (Rainham
et al., 2012). Another cause of spatial dependence is spatial spread,
since individuals who are close in space are in<U+FB02>uenced by their
neighbors' decisions (contagion), thus prompting other children to
choose the same method of transport (Sidharthan et al., 2011).
The most common barriers to ACS are distance and tra<U+FB03>c (Beck and
Greenspan, 2008; Chillón et al., 2014). Moreover, Beck and Greenspan
(2008) showed that families' behavior is not homogeneous throughout a
geographical area and that their choices may di<U+FB00>er depending on the
area in which they live. Therefore, besides distance, there are other
locational factors that cause school travel choices to be dependent on
location. These locational factors together with the contagion e<U+FB00>ect
may in<U+FB02>uence students' decisions, resulting in a spatial distribution of
that does not form concentric circles around high schools. Indeed, fa-
milies' decisions are likely related to the characteristics a<U+FB00>ecting a
given area, leading to the presence of spatial dependence. Pont et al.
(2009) conducted a review of some of the main factors related to ACS.
The authors investigated the physical, economic, social, cultural and
political factors of active transportation among young people. Of these
factors, we are particularly interested in the environmental character-
istics of the neighborhood as they have a spatial in<U+FB02>uence on the mode
choice for school transportation (Mitra, 2013). This author (Mitra and
Buliung, 2012) analyzed the presence of scale e<U+FB00>ects on the relation-
ship between ACS and the built environment, taking into account the
modi<U+FB01>able areal unit problem (MAUP).
In addition to distance, we address the e<U+FB00>ect of both local, face-to-
face contagion and locational variables that have similar e<U+FB00>ects on
households located in the same area and lead to the presence of spatial
dependence.
On the other hand, the classic logistic regression model assumes that
the decisions of individuals living in nearby houses are independent.
However, locational factors such as crime, tra<U+FB03>c, environmental fac-
tors, among others, may in<U+FB02>uence these decisions, leading to spatial
dependence. Sidharthan et al. (2011) estimated a spatial autoregressive
model (SAR) to test the e<U+FB00>ect of spatial interdependence on the choice
of transport mode. They found that the decision of an individual related
to children's school trips can a<U+FB00>ect the decisions of other individuals in
their environment. This spread may be due to spatial di<U+FB00>usion, social
spillover and e<U+FB00>ects related to unobserved variables that are spatially
autocorrelated (Anselin, 1988; Ripley, 1981). For example, if a person
decides to use active transport, this could persuade their neighbors to
do the same. Thus, a spatial contagion e<U+FB00>ect occurs by which some
individuals encourage other individuals in their neighborhood to make
similar decisions (Boix and Trullén, 2007). This spread e<U+FB00>ect, in addi-
tion to the e<U+FB00>ect of locational variables, which will be similar for all
families living in the same area, can lead to the presence of spatial
dependence. In a similar line, Mitra et al. (2010) detected the pre-
valence of walking to and from school for children aged 11–13 years old
in Toronto and the global presence of spatial autocorrelation and the
local clusters of walking trips.
In this paper, the regression-kriging method (RK) is used to achieve
the two main objectives of this work: to determine which of the four
types of distance best explains ACS and the area of in<U+FB02>uence of each
school. To achieve the <U+FB01>rst objective, 16 models have been estimated
(four for each high school) and the results have been compared. To
achieve the second aim, ACS has been predicted taking into account not

with a range of personal, school, family and social explanatory vari-
ables (age, income, etc.), which can have an in<U+FB02>uence on the fact that
two students who are at the same distance make di<U+FB00>erent transport
mode choices. However, these personal factors have not been included
in the models presented in this paper because one of the objectives has
been to obtain isoprobability maps, and to obtain such maps the ex-
planatory variables must be known at any point of the plane. For ex-
ample, the age of the surveyed individuals is known in the households
where they live, but is not known at any point on the map (s0).
Therefore, we consider an individual with average personal character-

istics, and assume that the decision made by that individual depends
only on factors related to the location. The isoprobability map shows
how likely that particular individual will be to vary his or her transport
mode choice depending on the location.

Once this individual is selected, the individual's mode of ACS will

vary spatially as a function of the relevant explanatory variables, such
as distance to school, the locational variables and contagion. For var-
ious reasons, the locational variables and contagion are sometimes not
measured, so they are omitted in the models. We assume that the

omitted variables are present in the perturbations and that the presence

of spatial autocorrelation in them is caused by the omission of these
relevant explanatory variables (Dubin, 1988).
In geostatistics, the key instrument to detect the presence of spatial

dependence is the variogram (Matheron, 1965; Cressie, 1991; Hengl

et al., 2007a; Hengl et al., 2007b; Chica-Olmo, 1995). An unbiased
estimator of the variogram of residuals is (Matheron, 1965):

N (h)
1
<U+03B3>e ^ (h) =           <U+2211>    [e (si + h) - e (si )]2
2N (h)   i=1                                                 (3)

where (si + h) and (si) are the locations of two households (one located
in si the other located at an ‘h’ distance from the household located in si)

and N(h) is the number of h distant household-pairs, that is, the number

of households that are separated by an ‘h’ distance. The value of the
empirical variogram (<U+03B3>e ^ (h) ) is shown in dots for households that are
separated by an approximate distance of 125 m, 250 m, 375 m and so
on (Fig. 3). It can also be observed how the spatial variability between

the residuals increases as the distance between the households in-

creases.
To perform estimations with the kriging method, it is necessary to <U+FB01>t
a model to the empirical variogram. To do so, we have used the sphe-

rical and Gaussian variogram models (see Fig. 3).

The model <U+FB01>t depends on three parameters: the nugget e<U+FB00>ect (C0),
the range (a) and the sill (C0 + C), where C is the partial sill. The
nugget e<U+FB00>ect is a measure of a random component, the range is de<U+FB01>ned
by the value of h in which the value of the variogram stabilizes and the

sill is the value that the variogram model attains at the range. The range

in Fig. 3 is 1000 m, meaning that the residuals are spatially auto-
correlated up to a distance of approximately 1000 m. The Gaussian and
spherical models are two of the most commonly used models in geos-
tatistics and represent continuous phenomena (Armstrong, 1998). Both

models show how the distance between houses increases, the variability
between the residuals also increases. This may be due to the fact that
students who live in houses proximate in space are a<U+FB00>ected by similar
locational variables and face-to-face contagion, and logically make si-

milar decisions. In contrast, when the distance between the houses in-

creases, these variables are less similar and the contagion is smaller,
which leads the students to make less similar decisions. Moreover, the
distances to everything else also increase and the areas may be per-
ceived by the students as not very walkable.
A measure of the intensity of the spatial dependence can be in-
vestigated using the relative nugget e<U+FB00>ect, that is, the ratio of the

nugget e<U+FB00>ect and sill. A ratio of less than 25% indicates strong spatial
dependence, a ratio between 25% and 75% indicates moderate spatial

This estimator is a weighted average of the known values (e) in the

locations si, and where <U+03BB>i are the kriging weights. These weights are

obtained by minimizing the variance of the estimation error and con-

sidering the structure of spatial autocorrelation detected with the var-

iogram (Matheron, 1965). The advantage to this method is that it

generally provides weights that are greater than the residuals located

closest to the location s0 and smaller weights for those furthest away

from the location.

In our study, expression (2) allows estimating the response of the
<U+F0B5> (s0) , which depends on the distance
binary variable ACS by the sum of m

between the house and the school, and e (^ s0) , which considers the

spatial autocorrelation structure of the residuals. Hence, we assume

that unobserved factors are utilized to improve the prediction by con-

sidering the spatial autocorrelation of residuals, instead of assuming (as

in classic logistic regression) that they are white noise (Zhang and

Wang, 2014). Expression (2) is an estimator which has the advantage of

allowing estimations at any point of the plane.


5. Results and discussion


The frequency and percentage of students who travel to school on

foot or by motorized modes of transportation are presented in Table 1.

Alhambra High School was found to have the highest percentage of

students who walk to school (84%), while Ganivet High School had the

lowest (57%). The descriptive characteristics of the four types of dis-

tances used to measure the proximity between home and school are also

shown in Table 1. As can be seen, the mean Euclidean distance is always

the shortest distance for all schools, while the mean driving distance is

always the longest. These results are in line with other studies that show
that the Euclidean distance is shorter than the Manhattan distance and
the network distance (Arafat and Abed Al Musa, 2017). However, an
interesting result of our work is that the mean walking distance and the
mean Manhattan distance are similar. There is not enough evidence to
reject our null hypothesis that the means of the walking distance and
the Manhattan distance are equal, since the p-value was greater than

0.05 for three schools (Alhambra, Soto de Rojas and Zaidín) and greater

than 0.01 for one (Ganivet). By contrast, there is evidence to reject the

null hypothesis that the di<U+FB00>erences between the means of the other

types of distances are equal, since the p-value was always less than 0.01.

Therefore, there are no signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences between the mean

Manhattan distance and the mean walking distance, but there are sig-

ni<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences between the other distances. This has practical

implications because it is much more cumbersome to obtain walking

distances than Manhattan distances.

The location of the students' homes and their mode of commuting to

school are shown in Fig. 2. There is a large concentration of households

around the Alhambra, Soto de Rojas and Zaidín high schools, while the

location of the households of students attending Ganivet High School

was more dispersed. Actually, the coe<U+FB03>cient of variation is similar to 1

for the three <U+FB01>rst high schools and 0.59 for Ganivet High School, thus

showing an almost double dispersion in this school (see Table 1). In

addition, this school has the longest average distance between house-
holds (1722.4 m), which also a<U+FB00>ects the rates of spatial dependence.

Hence, the students at Ganivet High School have lower spatial depen-
dence rates as indicated by the high value of the nugget e<U+FB00>ect (r-nug)

for this school (see Table 2).

As can be seen in Fig. 2, the Alhambra, Soto de Rojas and Zaidín

high schools are located in the southern part of the city. This is a

transition zone, with median housing prices and whose inhabitants are

of middle socioeconomic status. However, Ganivel High School is lo-

cated in the downtown area of the city, where housing prices are high

and the socioeconomic status is generally higher, which could be

related to the more frequent use of motorized vehicles (see Table 1).
In this study, 16 logistic regression models were obtained for each of
the four high schools, and four types of distances were performed
(Table 2). In all cases, the coe<U+FB03>cients of the models are signi<U+FB01>cant and
have a negative sign, thus indicating that as the distance increases, the
likelihood of ACS to school decreases. This result coincides with most of
the cases in the study of Pont et al. (2009). In order to compare the
di<U+FB00>erent kinds of distances (for the same school) we have used the
Nagelkerke adjusted R-squared and the Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC), which describe a trade-o<U+FB00> between the goodness-of-<U+FB01>t and its
complicity (Burnham and Anderson, 2004). According to these statis-
tics, the type of distance that properly explains the transport mode
choice at the Alhambra and Soto de Rojas schools is the Euclidean
distance as the statistical value of AIC is lower. However, the walking
distance shows the best results for the Ganivet and Zaidín schools.
Therefore, the Euclidean and walking distances best express the concept
of proximity between home and school for schools in these types of
environment.
It      is       also   possible      to       calculate     the     AIC
di<U+FB00>erence = <U+0394>i = AICi - AICmin (where AICmin is the minimum value).
A rule of thumb is when <U+0394>i > 10, the model fails to explain some
substantial variation in the data and the best model is when <U+0394>i = 0
(Burnham and Anderson, 2003). In this study, none of the distances
considered in the Alhambra and Zaidín high schools meet the stated
rule, so all distances substantially explain the variation in the data. On

to school for the four types of distances.
the other hand, the distance by car for the Ganivet and Soto high-
schools ful<U+FB01>lls this rule of thumb. Therefore, the level of empirical
support of this distance to explain ACS in these schools is basically low
or none (Burnham and Anderson, 2003). The low values of <U+0394>i for the
Alhambra and Zaidín high schools are due to the strong correlation
between the di<U+FB00>erent types of distances (see Table 1).
To detect the presence of the contagion e<U+FB00>ect of neighbors and the
locational variables, we have used the experimental variograms of re-
sidual e(si) and its <U+FB01>tted models, which is expressed in Fig. 4. A sphe-
rical model was adjusted to all the experimental variograms with the
exception of Alhambra High School, for which a Gaussian model was
<U+FB01>tted. The spherical model is linear for small distances, while the
Gaussian model represents an extremely continuous phenomenon
(Armstrong, 1998). Therefore, the residuals of Alhambra High School
present greater spatial continuity, that is, small changes in the distance
between houses (h) cause small changes in the variance of the residuals.
For the other schools, however, small changes in the distance between
houses lead to major changes in variability. In other words, the con-
tagion e<U+FB00>ect of the neighbors and the locational variables is less likely
to vary in space for the students attending Alhambra High School
compared to the other schools. However, this contagion e<U+FB00>ect and the
locational variables vary substantially in the space for the students at-
tending Ganivet High School.
The range of the variogram represents the distance at which the
residuals are correlated, that is, the range of spatial dependence. This

means that students living within that range are a<U+FB00>ected by similar
locational variables and face-to-face contagion and make similar deci-
sions. However, the residuals associated to the students living at a
further distance from this range are not correlated: when the variogram
reaches the sill, the covariance is canceled (Cressie, 1991). In the pre-
sent study the range is between 1025 (Ganivet High School) and
1630 m (Soto de Rojas High School). Thus, the e<U+FB00>ect of spatial de-
pendence between households has a radius of in<U+FB02>uence of about
1000–1600 m. This radius is quite similar to that obtained in other
studies (Broberg et al., 2013). This spatial dependence may be due to
both local or face-to-face contagion e<U+FB00>ects or caused by unobserved
locational variables (crime, tra<U+FB03>c, the environment, urban design, so-
cioeconomic characteristics, etc.) that have similar e<U+FB00>ects on house-
holds located in the same zone.
The ratio of the nugget e<U+FB00>ect in percentages (%) was also obtained
to determine the degree of spatial dependence (r-nug, Table 2). Spatial
dependence was found to be weak for Ganivet High School, moderate
for Soto de Rojas High School and strong for the Alhambra and Zaidín
schools.
It is important to note that a lower percentage of students at Ganivet
High School walk to school. The school also shows higher average
distances to school, as well as a lower degree of spatial dependence
(higher r-nug). In contrast, Alhambra is the high school with the highest
percentage of students who walk. Moreover, although the mean dis-
tance from home to school is not the lowest (due to its high statistical
dispersion), Alhambra is one of the schools with a greater degree of
spatial dependence because the relationship between the nugget and sill

is lower (lower r-nug). Moreover, the variograms of Alhambra High
School (Fig. 4) showed that students have a low elasticity to distance
between households that are close to each other (0–500 m), since there
is little variability between the residuals of the houses.
In line with the second aim of the study, isoprobability maps were
created to determine the likelihood that a child living anywhere in the
city will actively commute to school (Fig. 5). These maps represent the
areas of in<U+FB02>uence of ACS for four high schools in the city of Granada
taking into account the structure of variability detected by the vario-
grams. The estimated probabilities re<U+FB02>ect the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of each
school for each type of distance and have been obtained with RK (ex-
pression (2)). The red areas indicate the areas with the highest prob-
ability that a child will walk to school. These areas have been calculated
taking into account the distance from home to school and the spatial
dependence detected with variograms in the unobservable locational
variables (e(si)). The distances that students in these schools will walk
delimit the areas of in<U+FB02>uence. These areas are not circular in shape
because the students' travel mode choices are not a<U+FB00>ected only by the
distance to school, but by other unobservable locational factors that can
be obtained for any point level s0by the kriging method (e (^ s0) ).
To clearly illustrate the results of the RK method, Zaidín High
School has been taken as an example. Fig. 6 shows: (a) the map of ACS
isoprobabilities considering the Euclidean distance and the presence of
autocorrelation between the errors (<U+F0B5>     z (s0) ); (b) the isoprobabilities map
obtained by classic logistic regression considering only the distance
from home to school (m    <U+F0B5> (s0) ) and (c) the map of isovalues of residuals
(e (^ s0) ).

J. Chica-Olmo et al.
As can be observed, the <U+FB01>nal result for ACS (<U+F0B5>       z (s0) ) is a<U+FB00>ected not
only by the distance from home to school (m          <U+F0B5> (s0) ), but also by the
contagion e<U+FB00>ect and other locational variables that have not been in-
cluded in the model (e (^ s0) ). It is clearly observed that if only distance is
considered, the probability of walking to school would have a homo-
geneous spatial distribution in the form of concentric circles around the
school. However, the presence of autocorrelation among the residuals
caused by other locational factors deforms these concentric circles,
resulting in an irregular isoprobabilities map.

5.1. Study limitations
One of the main limitations of this work is that only one locational
variable (distance) has been used to explain the ACS model. The in-
clusion of other locational variables (crime, tra<U+FB03>c, the environment,
urban design, socioeconomic characteristics, etc.) would have im-
proved the overall understanding of the ACS model, but were not
measured because it was not on the aims of the study. Moreover, these
variables are often unavailable or di<U+FB03>cult or costly to measure.
However, we consider that the omission of these variables does not
invalidate the results obtained in this work since the global e<U+FB00>ect of

these factors on ACS has been considered indirectly by taking into ac-
count the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the model perturbations
caused by omitting these locational variables. Other limitations include

the convenience sampling of the participants: the sample is limited to
Spanish youth from southeastern Spain. Nonetheless, the sample size is
quite large. The main strengths in the current study was the use of a

valid questionnaire to measure children's commuting to school. An

additional strength of the work was the objective measurement of the
area of in<U+FB02>uence of each school.


6. Conclusions and policy implications

This study has analyzed the spatial distribution of households with

students who travel to four high schools located in Granada, Spain. Four
di<U+FB00>erent distances were examined to explain the e<U+FB00>ect of proximity
between the homes and the schools and measure the e<U+FB00>ect of each

distance and the presence of spatial dependence on the decision to walk
to school. The analysis has permitted us to determine the area of in-
<U+FB02>uence of each school.

The Euclidean distance has traditionally been considered to explain
the mode of commuting (Pont et al., 2009). The results we have ob-
tained indicate that the two types of distances that best explain the

decision to walk to school are the Euclidean distance and the walking
distance. Moreover, the presence of spatial dependence e<U+FB00>ects arising
from interactions among geographically close households has also been

observed. In general, the spatial dependence produced by locational

variables and spatial contagion by the students is moderate to strong,
except for Ganivet High School, for which it is weak. In addition, the
spatial range of the locational variables and the contagion e<U+FB00>ect is

approximately 1000 m to 1600 m. These <U+FB01>ndings have policy implica-
tions since the transport mode choice of the students is in<U+FB02>uenced by
locational variables and neighbors' decisions. They also highlight the

need for public institutions to improve the surrounding environment of
the schools in order to increase their walkable area of in<U+FB02>uence to
promote active commuting to school reiterating its social bene<U+FB01>ts and

promote a “domino e<U+FB00>ect” regarding individuals' decisions. These in-
terventions would decrease negative behavoir patterns (i.e., passive
commuting to school). In addiction, identifying these walkable areas

may be of interest for local services such as restaurants, supermarkets,
shops, etc. It is our hope that this study will provide some interesting
insights.

Recent developments in GIS have opened up new opportunities for

the use of spatial methodologies (Broberg and Sarjala, 2015). RK could
be implemented in a GIS to allow state agencies and municipalities to
determine the areas of in<U+FB02>uence of schools and aid urban designers and

planners in developing neighborhoods that support ACS in order to feed
into policy decisions.
