The study examines historical changes in size and location of schools in New Jersey and their relevance to children’s walking and
bicycling to school. It compares the characteristics of schools, students, and surrounding areas of schools established in different
decades to identify the critical issues that affect active transportation to school in the state. The study shows that schools in the state
have become larger and they are increasingly being located on state and county roads instead of local roads. Pedestrian safety for
children seems to be a greater concern in the state than distance to school.
Keywords: active transportation, bicycling, school location, school siting, school transportation, walking

School Siting in New Jersey
It may be noted at the outset that the terms urban and sub-
urban have been occasionally used in this paper in reference
to school location. In the absence of precise urban–suburban
classification of the state’s municipalities, a combination of
information from the Census and the New Jersey Department
of Labor was used in conjunction with the authors’ judgment
to identify areas as urban or suburban.


2. Background

2.1. Literature Review

Location and size of schools are important to transportation
planners because they affect the travel modes of schoolchildren
and their parents, as well as the safety of children walking or
bicycling to school. When schools are located far from homes,
the propensity of children to walk or bicycle to school
diminishes. Similarly, when schools are located on or near roads
with high traffic volumes and speed, the safety of schoolchildren
is compromised. Thus, excessive distance between homes and
schools, as well as the location of schools in unsafe environ-
ments, can be a deterrent to the efforts to promote walking
and bicycling among children under the federal SRTS program.
School siting policies and practices that affect the size and
location of schools can have serious environmental conse-
quences due to the emission of greenhouse gases by school-
related motorized travel, as well as health impacts due to high
exposure to bus fumes and diminished physical activity by chil-
dren (McDonald 2008a; Wilson, Wilson, and Krizek 2007).
Fortunately, school siting practices have come under
immense scrutiny by government agencies in recent years.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified a num-
ber of critical issues in a 2003 study about the consequences of
changes in school characteristics over time (U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency 2003). According to the study, the number of
schools nationwide has decreased 70% since World War II,
whereas the average number of students per school has
increased fivefold, from 127 to 653. In addition to emphasizing
that the replacement of small neighborhood schools by larger
but fewer schools discourages walking and bicycling among
children, the EPA claims that because of a poor walking
environment around new schools, many students who live
within walking distance currently travel to school predominantly
by school bus or household vehicle.
A large number of studies have found that distance between
home and school decreases children’s propensity to walk or
bicycle to school (Ewing, Schroeer, and Greene 2004; McDo-
nald 2007; McDonald 2008a; McDonald 2008b; Stewart 2011;
Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008). Stewart (2011) identified a
large number of studies that showed evidence of distance being
a deterrent to walking and bicycling to school. From her
research with the U.S. National Household Travel Survey
(NHTS) data, McDonald concluded in three studies (McDonald
2007; McDonald 2008a; McDonald 2008b) that distance to
school decreases the propensity for active transportation to
school. In one of those studies, McDonald (2007) concluded that
the increase in distance between home and school can poten-
tially explain about half the decrease in walking and bicycling
by schoolchildren between 1969 and 2001.
603
The increasing distance between homes and schools is par-
tially due to the replacement of small neighborhood schools
with large regional schools. Although the association between
number of students and schools’ academic performance is sub-
ject to debate, it can be inferred from some studies that lower
student enrollment could be potentially associated with higher
academic performance (Andrews, Duncombe, and Yinger
2002; Beaumont and Pianca 2002). Other studies have shown
that lower enrollment promotes children’s walking and bicy-
cling to school (Falb et al. 2007). Yet, as noted by Beaumont
and Pianca (2002), small schools are increasingly being replaced

by large regional schools to draw students from larger areas.
Some authors have attributed the trend of replacing small
schools with large schools to suburbanization, a tendency to
build new schools on undeveloped land, and the practice of set-
ting a minimum lot-size requirement for schools (Crider and
Hall 2006).
Although distance to school appears to be the most signifi-
cant deterrent to active transportation to school, studies have
shown that urban form and socioeconomic characteristics of
neighborhoods also play an important role in determining
children’s transportation mode to school (Kerr et al. 2006;
McMillan 2007). McMillan (2007) found that physical charac-
teristics of homes as well as street characteristics affect chil-
dren’s travel mode to school, whereas Kerr et al. (2006) found
that attributes of neighborhoods and streets affect children’s tra-
vel to school differently in high-income and low-income areas.
Although, as shown in Stewart (2011), a large number of vari-
ables, including distance to school, sidewalk quality, street con-
nectivity, walkability, land-use mix, and population density,
have been found to have a significant effect on walking and
bicycling by schoolchildren, in the realm of school siting prac-
tices, size of schools and distance to schools have gained the
greatest attention. In a bid to address these issues, the EPA pub-
lished its first School Siting Guidelines in 2011 (U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency 2011), which suggests, among other
things, considerations regarding distance to school, size of
schools, design of schools, cost of school transportation, avail-
ability of alternative transportation modes, and sidewalk con-
nectivity. Similar guidelines have been published by at least
two states, Oregon and California (California Department of
Education 2012; Transportation and Growth Management Pro-
gram 2005), as well as a metropolitan planning organization
(Atlanta Regional Commission 2003).



2.2. Travel to and from School by New Jersey Children
The literature review indicates that a primary transportation-
related concern regarding school siting practices nationally is
an increasing distance between home and school. Increasing dis-
tance appears to decrease walking and bicycling propensity. By
increasing dependence on motorized modes, distance increases
vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions. The
second major concern regarding school siting is the location
of schools in areas that are not safe for walking or bicycling.
School location in unsafe areas increases the exposure of chil-
dren to crashes, and thereby reduces the likelihood of walking
and bicycling.

604
It is evident from an analysis of 2009 NHTS data that dis-
tance to school is a less serious concern in New Jersey compared
to most other states, whereas safety of children walking or bicy-
cling to school is a greater concern. According to the NHTS,
13% of New Jersey children ages 5–15 walk to or from school,
45% travel by household vehicle, and 42% take the school bus.
The proportion of children walking and making trips by house-
hold vehicles in New Jersey is virtually identical to the national
average despite the fact that New Jersey children, on average,
live closer to school than do children in most states. Although
52% of schoolchildren nationwide live farther than two miles
and 71% live farther than one mile from school, 45% of stu-
dents in New Jersey live farther than two miles and 64% live
farther than one mile. In many states, including West Virginia,
Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee,
more than 75% of the students live farther than two miles from
school. New Jersey students also spend less time traveling to
school compared to students in most other states. Although
the average travel time from home to school for New Jersey
children ages 5–15 is only 13 minutes, the national average is
16 minutes, and in many states, such as Mississippi, Arkansas,
Louisiana, Kentucky, and Delaware, children, on average, spend
20 minutes or more traveling to school.
The NHTS also shows that New Jersey parents are less con-
cerned about distance to school than children’s safety. The pro-
portion of New Jersey parents who perceive distance to school
as a serious concern (40%) is almost identical to the nation
(41%). However, potentially because of the relatively urbanized
nature of the state, traffic volume and speed are of far greater
concern for New Jersey parents compared to parents nationwide.
Although 43% of parents nationwide perceive traffic volume on
roads as a serious issue for their children’s travel to school, 56%
of New Jersey parents are concerned about traffic volume. Simi-
larly, 48% of New Jersey parents consider traffic speed on
roads as a serious issue, whereas only 40% of parents nationally
show that level of concern. These differences are significant at
the 1% level on an independent-sample t test. Although the state
contains a few older cities with very high crime rates, poten-
tially because most residents live in low-crime areas, a signifi-
cantly lower proportion of New Jersey parents perceive crime
to be a serious issue (8%) compared to the nation as a whole
(14%). Overall, the 2009 NHTS data shows that parents in
New Jersey are more concerned about traffic volume and speed
than distance to school or crime. Their concern about traffic vol-
ume and speed could potentially explain why the proportion of
children walking to school is not higher in the state than the
national average, particularly considering that students in New
Jersey, on average, live closer to school.
New Jersey parents have a reason to be concerned about traf-
fic safety when it comes to children walking to school. Accord-
ing to 2009 data from the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), New Jersey ranks fifth among all
states in terms of total number of pedestrian fatalities (National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration 2011). Perhaps more
important, it is only second to Washington, DC, in terms of ped-
estrian fatalities as a proportion of total traffic fatalities.
Approximately 27% of traffic accident fatalities in the state
are pedestrian fatalities.
D. Deka and L. Von Hagen
Pedestrian crashes in New Jersey are not uniformly distribu-
ted across its 21 counties. According to a 2011 report prepared
by the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center of Rutgers Uni-
versity, where geocoded crash data were analyzed for the 2003–
2010 period, far more crashes involving pedestrians occur in
heavily urban counties such as Essex, Hudson, Bergen, Union,
and Passaic than in predominantly suburban counties (Alan
M. Voorhees Transportation Center 2011). When normalized
by the population of each county, pedestrian crashes in the pre-
dominantly urban counties appear to be even more frequent.
Although schools may be closer to homes in the urban counties
than in the predominantly suburban counties, because of the
greater frequency of pedestrian crashes in urban areas, parents
may be averse to the idea of children walking to school.


3. Analysis of Schools Established in Different
Periods

3.1. Data
Because the primary objective of this research is to examine the
characteristics of the New Jersey schools that were established
in different time periods, data pertaining to the year of establish-
ment of schools is crucial. According to a list acquired from the
Office of School Facilities of the NJDOE, there are 2,445 public
schools throughout the state, of which 1,903 include at least 30
students in the K–8 grades. Because the NJDOE data set
included establishment years for only 878 schools (46%),
additional efforts were necessary to acquire the establishment
years for the remaining schools. The establishment years for
an additional 675 schools (36%) were obtained by visiting the
web pages of individual schools and through an inquiry to
school officials by e-mail. For the remaining 350 schools
(18%), the establishment years could not be obtained. Although
this is a limitation of the data, further examination of the schools
showed that the schools with an establishment year are virtually
identical to the schools without an establishment year in terms
of geographic diversity and number of students per school.
For example, the county-specific distribution of the schools with
an establishment year is 98% similar to the distribution of all
schools, whereas the mean number of K–8 students in the
schools with an establishment year is only 0.67% smaller than
all schools (443 vs. 446 students). Thus, the schools with data
on an establishment year can be considered highly representa-
tive of all public schools with 30 or more K–8 students in the
state. Figure 1 shows the location of the 1,903 schools in the
data set, distinguishing the schools with data on an establish-
ment year from those with missing data on an establishment
year.
Additional information on schools, including number of stu-
dents, racial and ethnic diversity of students, class size, and stu-
dents’ participation in the free-lunch program, was compiled
from a publicly available NJDOE data source (New Jersey
Department of Education 2011). To examine the socioeconomic
characteristics of the areas around schools established in differ-
ent time periods, data from the 2006–2010 ACS were extracted
at the census tract level and aggregated for one-mile buffers
around each school by using a GIS (geographic information

system). All census tracts bisected by a circle with a one-mile
radius around a school were included in the buffer. Location-
specific geocoded data on pedestrian crashes for the period
2003–2010 were obtained from the Plan4Safety database main-
tained by the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transpor-
tation at Rutgers University (2012). This database contains
detailed information on all reported crash locations, crash char-
acteristics, and the characteristics of the victims. Finally, data on
lot size, or parcel size, of most schools were obtained from the
New Jersey Geographic Information Network (New Jersey
Office of Information Technology 2012). For schools missing
information in this data source, parcel sizes were manually
approximated by using GIS polygons.

3.2. Descriptive Analysis of Schools Established in
Different Time Periods
To examine the variations in size of New Jersey schools estab-
lished in different time periods, the mean number of enrolled
students and the mean lot size of schools established in different
decades are compared in Figure 2. The mean number of students
is noticeably higher for newer schools, especially schools estab-
lished since 1960, compared to older schools. Although the
mean lot size of schools established in the 1990s is larger than
schools established in other decades, the data does not
605
necessarily show that lot sizes of schools have become larger
over time. Overall, the data indicate that newer schools, on aver-
age, have more students than older schools, whereas the lot size
of schools has fluctuated from decade to decade without show-
ing a pattern of consistent change over time.
On the basis of the national literature, one might expect
schools to be increasingly located in suburban areas, but in
New Jersey schools appear to be returning to urban areas.
Schools established since 1980 appear to be locating with
greater frequency in urban areas compared to the schools estab-
lished in the 1960s and 1970s, although many of the urban areas
with new schools are in counties that are usually considered sub-
urban, such as Monmouth, Ocean, and Burlington. A reason for
the growth of urban schools in these counties could be the
growth of population in their urban centers.
Figure 3 shows the proportion of minority and free-lunch stu-
dents in schools, as well as the mean number of crashes involv-
ing children under age 18 within a half-mile buffer around
schools during the eight-year period, 2003–2010. All three vari-
ables show a decline up to the 1960s, but they change direction
beyond that period, indicating a higher proportion of minority
and free-lunch students, as well as a higher frequency of ped-
estrian crashes in school surroundings, for newer schools. An
analysis of race and ethnicity of the population within a one-
mile buffer around schools also showed a higher proportion of
African American and Hispanic populations around schools
established since the 1970s compared to the schools established
in the 1950s and 1960s.
A reason for the increase in the number of urban schools in
the state may be the introduction of a new funding formula
aimed at decreasing disparity between school districts in afflu-
ent communities and disadvantaged communities. By virtue of
state legislation following several court rulings in the 1980s
and early 1990s, often referred to as the Abbott Rulings, cur-
rently 31 school districts in disadvantaged communities are
designated as School Development Authority (SDA) districts
to ensure that they receive additional state aid. Although dis-
tricts statewide include an average of four K–8 schools, SDA
districts typically include a far larger number of schools, many
containing more than 20 schools. The recent growth of schools
in SDA districts is evident from the fact that 10% of the schools
established during the 1940–1959 period and 12% of the
schools established in the 1960–1979 period are in SDA dis-
tricts, whereas 27% of the schools established since 1980 are
located in SDA districts.

3.3. A Model Distinguishing Schools Established in
Different Periods
Although the descriptive statistics in Figure 2 and Figure 3 pro-
vide certain insights, in order to statistically compare the char-
acteristics of schools and their surroundings by establishment
period, a multinomial logit model was used. For the modeling
purpose, the schools were divided into five discrete categories
depending on their year of establishment: the pre-1920 schools,
the 1920–1949 schools, the 1950–1959 schools, the 1960–1979
schools, and the post-1979 schools. The categories were chosen
to ensure that no category included too many or too few schools.

606
Fig. 2. Mean number of students and plot area of K–8 schools by es
Since the 1950s experienced a boom in school construction, the
schools established during that decade were included as a separ-
ate category, whereas two or more decades were combined for
the other categories.
The multinomial model treats time periods as categorical
instead of continuous or ordinal. The categorical treatment of
time allows greater flexibility than an ordinal treatment because
it avoids the assumption that the characteristics of the schools
changed in a sequential manner from one time period to the
next. The results of the model are presented in Table 1.
The means and standard deviations of the independent vari-
ables in Table 1 are provided for the five different time periods
in Table 2. The F-statistics comparing within-group and
between-group variations showed that the variations between

time periods were statistically significant for all variables shown
in the table. The numerical values of the means in Table 2 show
that, compared to the 1960–1979 period, the schools established
since 1980 have a greater number of students, whereas their sur-
roundings have greater proportions of African American and
Hispanic persons, and a lower proportion of single detached
homes. Furthermore, the surroundings of schools established
since 1980 experience a greater number of youth pedestrian
crashes and fatal pedestrian crashes involving persons of all
ages. Finally, a lower proportion of schools established since
1980 are located on local roads compared to schools established
during the 1960–1979 period.
In the multinomial model in Table 1, the period 1960–1979
was used as the referent category, meaning that the coefficients

School Siting in New Jersey
of the four models in the table show a comparison of the vari-
ables for the four specific time periods in relation to the schools
established during the 1960–1979 period. Thus, the negative
sign of the statistically significant variable on number of stu-
dents for the periods pre-1920, 1920–1949, and 1950–1959 indi-
cates that the schools established during these periods, on
average, have a smaller number of students than the schools
established during the 1960–1979 period, whereas the positive
sign of the variable for the post-1979 period indicates that the
schools established during this period have a larger number of
students.
Several other important observations can be made from the
model results. Compared to the 1960–1979 schools, the schools
established in the prior decades have a smaller proportion of sin-
gle detached homes, a smaller proportion of automobile commu-
ters, and a greater proportion of Hispanic residents in their
surroundings, all indicating that the older schools are more often
located in urban settings compared to the schools established
during the 1960–1979 period. The frequency of pedestrian
crashes involving children under age 18 within a half-mile buf-
fer is higher for schools established prior to 1950 than for
schools established during 1960–1979. Another disturbing fact
that emerges from the results is that the older schools are less
likely to be located on local roads (or more likely to be located
on county or state roads) compared to the schools established
during the 1960–1979 period. Although many of the older
schools might have been located on local roads at the time of
establishment, with the increase in automobile travel and sub-
sequent redesignation of local roads to county or state roads,
currently many older schools are located on county or state
roads where traffic volumes and speed are generally higher than
local roads.
The newest schools—those established in 1980 or later—are
different from the schools established in the 1960–1979 period
only regarding the number of students, proportion of Hispanic
residents in their surroundings, average commute time in the
surrounding area, and type of road where schools are located.
Although Figure 3 shows that the number of crashes involving
youth pedestrian victims is higher around newer schools com-
pared to the schools established in the 1960s, the model does
not show statistical significance for the variable on crashes
because the referent category includes both the 1960s and
1970s. In fact, the areas surrounding the schools established in
the 1970s as well as the schools established since 1980 experi-
ence higher youth pedestrian crashes than the schools estab-
lished in the 1950s and 1960s. Finally, the model shows that
the oldest and the newest schools are significantly more likely
to be located on state and county roads instead of on local roads
compared to the schools established in the 1960s and 1970s.
This suggests that the location of the newest schools is influ-
enced, at least to a certain degree, by the intent of reducing tra-
vel time for motorized school trips.



3.4. The Factors Associated with School Enrollment
Considering that the increasing size of schools has received a
significant level of attention in recent studies, a separate effort
was made to examine the factors associated with school
609
enrollment by using the data set for the 1,553 New Jersey
schools described previously. Correlation analysis was underta-
ken in an initial step to examine how school enrollment is asso-
ciated with other characteristics of the schools and the attributes
of the areas where schools are located. The results, not presented
in this paper because of space limitations, showed that the num-
ber of enrolled students is positively associated with establish-
ment year, percentage of free-lunch students, percentage of
Hispanic students, percentage of Asian students, school location
in SDA district, and density of children ages 5–14 in surround-
ings. On the other hand, the number of enrolled students is nega-
tively associated with median household income and the
proportion of detached homes in the surrounding area.
An ordinary least squares regression model was subsequently
used to examine how these variables are associated with enroll-
ment when the effects of the other variables are controlled for.
The results, presented in Table 3, show further evidence that
schools in the state are becoming larger over time. Table 3 also
shows that enrollment is higher in schools with a high pro-
portion of Asian and Hispanic students, as well as in schools
located in areas with a high density of children ages 5–14. In
contrast, enrollment is lower in schools located in areas with
high household income. No evidence was found that the schools
in the SDA districts have higher enrollment than other school
districts. The proportion of single-family homes in the surround-
ing area was also not found to be statistically significant. The
correlation and regression results together seem to suggest that
the consequences of schools becoming larger are likely to be felt
more by the schools in lower-income and minority communities
than by the schools in affluent communities.

4. Discussion

In view of a national concern about evolving school siting
practices, especially the increasing distance between homes
and schools and the location of schools in unsafe locations,
this research examined the current characteristics of the
New Jersey schools established in different time periods. It indi-
cated that like the country as a whole, New Jersey schools
became larger over the decades. However, this increase in size
is reflected only in the number of enrolled students, not in lot
size. The NHTS data showed that New Jersey students, on aver-
age, live closer to schools than in the country as a whole, and yet
the proportions of students walking and being driven to school
are virtually the same in the state as the country. New Jersey
students appear to walk and bicycle less not because of
distance to school, but due to an apprehension about unsafe
walking conditions, as reflected in the parents’ responses
in the NHTS. Pedestrian crash data from the NHTSA also indi-
cates that New Jersey ranks very high in terms of pedestrian
fatalities.
Two tendencies in school siting practices in New Jersey
require particular attention. First, recent years have seen a
revival of school establishment in urban communities. Although
schools in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were predominantly
established in suburban communities, the newest schools are
being established in urban communities at a higher rate than
in the previous decades. Many of the new schools are located
in SDA districts. Although the tendency to build new schools
in urban communities may reduce distance between homes
and schools, it also causes concern about the safety of children

because urban areas generally account for a far greater number

of pedestrian crashes than suburban areas. Although the high

crash incidents in urban areas may be associated with higher

pedestrian volumes (i.e., exposure), most parents are possibly
not informed enough to consider pedestrian exposure when it
comes to the safety of their children walking to school. Parents’
concern about crashes in urban areas can thus reduce the
propensity of walking and bicycling by children in urban areas.
The second tendency relating to school siting practices that
deserves attention in New Jersey is the type of road where
new schools are being located. Although the schools established
in the 1960s and 1970s were predominantly located in suburban
areas, they were often located on local roads. In contrast,
a larger proportion of the oldest schools are located on state
or county roads that usually carry large volumes of vehicular
traffic. Schools established since 1980 also tend to be located
on state or county roads. Although many of the oldest schools
are probably located on county and state roads because of
redesignation of roads over the years, the newest schools are
seemingly located on county and state roads to accommodate
vehicular traffic to and from school.
Statistical analyses in this study showed that household
income in school surroundings is negatively associated with
school enrollment. This suggests that the issues related to larger
schools are less relevant for affluent communities. Since most of
the affluent communities are located in the suburbs, pedestrian

safety in terms of number of crashes in the vicinity is also less
of an issue for schools located in these communities. Because of
the revival of schools in urban communities and more frequent
D. Deka and L. Von Hagen
occurrence of pedestrian crashes in school surroundings, greater
attention is needed for schools located in urban areas.
Finally, this research shows that the relative importance of
the concerns regarding school siting may vary from state to
state. For example, although increasing distance between homes
and schools may be a greater concern for states that are less
urbanized than New Jersey, for highly urbanized states such
as New Jersey, issues related to pedestrian safety may be more
important than distance to school. Furthermore, issues within
the same state may vary from place to place, depending on
the level of urbanization, traffic conditions, and occurrence of
pedestrian crashes, thereby making the task of preparing a state-
wide set of school siting guidelines more challenging.
Because this study showed that, unlike many other states, the
primary issue in New Jersey is not suburbanization of schools or
increasing distance between homes and schools, but rather an
increase in number of schools in urban areas, the SRTS program
run by the New Jersey Department of Transportation decided
that improving safety around urban schools through a direct
approach is a greater priority at present than preparing a set of
statewide school siting guidelines. As a follow-up to this study,
the authors, along with other researchers at Rutgers University,
are conducting a safety-education program involving urban mid-
dle school children and preparing to conduct pedestrian safety
audits around selected urban schools with high incidences of
youth pedestrian crashes in surrounding areas.
