Washington. The modeling results indicate that (1) enhanced sidewalk modi<U+FB01>cations and bike lane accom-
modations encourage students walking and biking to school; (2) the implementation of Seattle's student as-

(4) in school areas with high employment density, biking to school may be a more attractive option for students;
(5) greater crosswalk density may encourage more students to walk to school; (6) the density of bike crashes is
negatively associated with students biking to school. In terms of policy implications, transport planners should
continually promote walking and biking supportive environments and implement policies to encourage active
student travel.

which preserves SRTS programs' funding for the next <U+FB01>ve years (Safe
routes to school national partnership, 2016). This act further highlights
the importance of SRTS programs. Understanding the e<U+FB00>ect of com-
pleted SRTS projects on AST is therefore essential for policymakers to
e<U+FB00>ectively lead future programs.
However, SRTS programs have not been entirely successful. Parents
often still drive their children to school due to concerns about trans-
portation safety (Evers et al., 2014; Oluyomi et al., 2014; Seraj et al.,
2012). In addition, walking to school is not attractive for many students
because schools are located far from student homes and a distance > 1
mile discourages walking for most school children (Beck and Nguyen,
2017; Coughenour et al., 2017; Deka, 2013; Gropp et al., 2012;
Hatamzadeh et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2013; McDonald, 2008a; Müller
et al., 2008; Rodríguez-López et al., 2017; Schlossberg et al., 2006).
Moreover, the probability of walking or biking to school is much
greater if the average travel time is < 15 min (Larouche et al., 2014)
which is often not the case for students.
In terms of research that examines AST and SRTS programs directly,
there are two major lines of research examining school travel. Many
recently published studies focus on individual or household factors,
such as parental preferences, the age and/or grade and the gender of
school children, and the di<U+FB03>culty of walking and biking (Ahern et al.,
2017; Gropp et al., 2012; Lang et al., 2011; Mammen et al., 2014;
Mehdizadeh et al., 2017; Trapp et al., 2011), and many have employed
interview or attitudinal survey for data collection (Ahern et al., 2017;
Benson and Scriven, 2012; Mammen et al., 2012; McDonald et al.,
2011; Seraj et al., 2012; Spinney and Millward, 2011). The other set of
studies focuses on location-based factors, and largely rely on discrete
choice models to examine contributing factors (Ermagun et al., 2015;
Kamargianni and Polydoropoulou, 2013; Sidharthan et al., 2011). Ad-
ditionally, most of these studies are cross-sectional, therefore very few
studies have examined SRTS/AST in the terms of built environment
interventions over prolonged periods of time (Gallimore et al., 2011).
However, a few studies have suggested a positive relationship between
implementation of SRTS programs and student AST (Atteberry et al.,
2016; Buckley et al., 2013; Hoelscher et al., 2016; McDonald et al.,
2013; Mitra and Buliung, 2014; Stewart et al., 2014), but overall robust
evaluations of SRTS programs remain limited (Boarnet et al., 2005b;
Cradock et al., 2012; Dumbaugh and Frank, 2007; McDonald et al.,
2014b; Ragland et al., 2014).
This study contributes to the SRTS/AST literature in the following
ways. First, it is a longitudinal study based on twelve-years of student
travel records, which helps evaluate whether pedestrian and bicycle
master plans have successfully promoted AST. Second, this study ex-
plores the e<U+FB00>ect of various features on student mode choice. This study
begins with a literature review, followed by the research design and
methodological details, then presents the results, and ends with dis-
cussion and conclusions. Findings from this study will assist policy-
makers future pedestrian/bicycle master plans, provide urban planners
with e<U+FB00>ective ways to gradually alter the built environments, and
promote a better environment that meets children's AST needs.

2. Literature review

2.1. Modeling frameworks

In response to various negative impacts of automobile-oriented
development, researchers have produced a large amount of studies
identifying determinants of travel mode choices: some of which concern
the promotion of AST and SRTS programs for children. These studies
analyze a wide variety of factors, including social, cultural, individual/
household, and physical environmental elements. Several frameworks
have been proposed to explain decision making in terms of travel mode.
For instance, McMillan proposed a <U+FB01>ve-level model for the decision-
making process of primary school students' AST, where urban form is
identi<U+FB01>ed as the key in parental perceptions of the relevant

Journal of Transport Geography 70 (2018) 265–274
environment (McMillan, 2007). Building on McMillan's work, Panter
et al. expanded on the analysis by including location-based neighbor-
hood characteristics such as origins, destinations, and routes (Panter
et al., 2008). Stewart et al. (2012) synthesize previous <U+FB01>ndings on AST
and propose a conceptual framework consisting of eight groups of
factors related to school children walking or bicycling to school, in-
cluding distance to school, parental fear of tra<U+FB03>c and crime, schedule
constraints, value, weather, school characteristics, resources, and cul-
ture. Mitra (2013) reviewes related literature and proposes a frame-
work of multiple levels of in<U+FB02>uence on mode choice for school trans-
portation, including urban environment, household, characteristics of a
child/youth, and other external factors. However, most studies do
adopt a simpli<U+FB01>ed framework by jointly focusing on individual/
household and environmental factors (Atteberry et al., 2016).

2.2. Quantifying the built environment at di<U+FB00>erent scales

Previous studies have examined the impact of built environments on
school travel at di<U+FB00>erent scales. Most previous research explores the
relationship at the site-level, referring to areas nearby school or homes,
but some studies have been implemented at the area-level, such as
census tracts (Ewing et al., 2004; McDonald, 2008b) and tra<U+FB03>c analysis
zones (TAZs) (Mitra and Buliung, 2014); while several other studies are
conducted as a corridor-level analysis, where the analysis unit is de-
<U+FB01>ned as the area along a home-to-school path. Among site-level studies,
the bu<U+FB00>er size quantifying the built environment varies, but the most
commonly used bu<U+FB00>er distances range from 250 m to 1000 m, based on
the concept of normal walking distance. However, the appropriate
analytical unit or units may depend on the target population or en-
vironment and may require empirical evaluation (Brownson et al.,
2009).

2.3. Built environment factors associated with active school travel

Many studies have examined the e<U+FB00>ects of built environment factors
on AST. While the results have some noticeable inconsistencies; several
factors are commonly identi<U+FB01>ed as key to explaining student preference
for walking and bicycling. Distance to school is the most important
factor in determining walking or bicycling among students. Even for
students who live within a walkable or bike-able distance to school,
distance acts as a strong determinant, in<U+FB02>uencing the likelihood of
walking and biking (Stewart et al., 2012).The e<U+FB00>ect of density on school
children AST has also been repeatedly examined. Many studies have
suggested that either household density or population density is posi-
tively associated with AST (Broberg and Sarjala, 2015; Deka, 2013;
Frank et al., 2007; Kerr et al., 2006; Kweon et al., 2006; McDonald,
2007, 2008b; Mitra et al., 2010). For example, Frank et al. collects AST
choice data using a two-day travel diary of 3161 students and <U+FB01>nds that
the odds of walking are 3.7 times greater for students living in high-
density neighborhoods comparing with those living in low-density ones
(Frank et al., 2007). While some other studies (Bringolf-Isler et al.,
2008; Ewing et al., 2004) suggest that household density is unrelated to
student AST.
Existing studies show con<U+FB02>icting evidence in regard to the e<U+FB00>ect of
mixed land use on student AST. Some studies <U+FB01>nd that students living in
neighborhoods with high degrees of land use mixture are more likely to
walk or bike to school (Broberg and Sarjala, 2015; Hatamzadeh et al.,
2016; Lin and Chang, 2010). A few other studies suggest that only the
land use mixture near schools is positively correlated with AST choices,
while land use mixture near homes shows no signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect (Larsen
et al., 2009; McMillan, 2007). Still, other studies suggest there is no
signi<U+FB01>cant relationship between land use mixture either at home or
school and student AST (Kerr et al., 2006; Mitra and Buliung, 2014).
Good street-connectivity contributes to the directness of routes as
well as the ease of path-<U+FB01>nding, hence encouraging walking and bicy-
cling. Di<U+FB00>erent methods have been applied to measure street-
266

connectivity, including street dead-end density (Kweon et al., 2006;
Schlossberg et al., 2006), intersection density (Broberg and Sarjala,
2015; Kerr et al., 2006; Kweon et al., 2006; Mitra et al., 2010; Mota
et al., 2007; Schlossberg et al., 2006), average block size (Lin and
Chang, 2010; McDonald, 2007), length of street segments (Bringolf-
Isler et al., 2008; Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008), and street cen-
terline density (Ewing et al., 2004). Findings from these studies are also
con<U+FB02>icting. Some report that AST is positively correlated with inter-
section density (Kerr et al., 2006; Mitra et al., 2010; Mota et al., 2007;
Schlossberg et al., 2006) and negatively correlated with street dead-end
density (Kweon et al., 2006; Schlossberg et al., 2006), while the others
show no evidence of signi<U+FB01>cant association (Ewing et al., 2004).
Finally, a few studies have examined the e<U+FB00>ect of non-motorized
road infrastructures on student AST mode choice. The sidewalk

coverage of a neighborhood (Ewing et al., 2004) and sidewalk mod-
i<U+FB01>cations (Boarnet et al., 2005a) are positively associated with student
AST, while the e<U+FB00>ect of bike infrastructure appeared to be insigni<U+FB01>cant.
A study conducted in California suggests that the total length of bike
lanes within a 400-m bu<U+FB00>er near homes is not signi<U+FB01>cantly associated
with a di<U+FB00>erence in AST (Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008). Similarly,
another study assesses <U+FB01>ve state SRTS programs and <U+FB01>nds that bike
infrastructure improvement has no statistically signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on
increasing the rate of biking to school (Stewart et al., 2012). Another
study indicates that route conditions (including the presence of steep
hills, speed and tra<U+FB03>c, and insu<U+FB03>cient daylight in the morning, etc.)
have an e<U+FB00>ect on mode choice (Chillón et al., 2014). Lastly, an addi-
tional study looks at similar variables related to the comfort and at-
tractiveness of the travel route, such as the presence of parks and

sidewalk maintenance, and again <U+FB01>nds that the overall quality of
walking and biking environments helps promote AST (Larsen et al.,
2012; Lee et al., 2013).

2.4. Tra<U+FB03>c safety and environment security correlated with active school
travel

Tra<U+FB03>c calming strategies promote AST, and this positive e<U+FB00>ect has
been continually con<U+FB01>rmed by many studies (Larouche et al., 2014).
Tra<U+FB03>c calming improvements include the installment of tra<U+FB03>c signals,
stop signs, speed bumps, and tra<U+FB03>c circles, the improvement of cross-
walks, and the isolation of pedestrian/bicycle tra<U+FB03>c from road tra<U+FB03>c
(Boarnet et al., 2005b; Dumbaugh and Frank, 2007). A high crime rate
discourages students walking and biking to school (Deka, 2013;
Larouche et al., 2014; Loukaitou-Sideris, 2006). Fear of strangers is a
key deterrent discouraging walking to school (Schlossberg et al., 2006).


3. Research design


3.1. Research objective


Though AST mode choices have been examined, existing studies

rarely investigate the longer-term e<U+FB00>ect of implementing pedestrian/

bicycle plans. Some e<U+FB00>ects resulting from non-motorized infrastructure

changes may not be observed in the short term, and previous cross-

sectional studies using short-term observations may have biases in

terms of understanding the intervention of pedestrian/bicycle plans.

Therefore, this study initiates a longitudinal analysis to evaluate the

in<U+FB02>uence of pedestrian and bicycle master plans. The objective of this

study is to identify factors associated with changes in walking and

biking mode share among school-age children.


3.2. Study area and data source

Washington's SRTS program was initiated in 2005. Since then, the
Washington Department of Transportation has awarded almost $71
million to fund SRTS projects for 271 schools (Washington State
Department of Transportation, 2017). Preliminary results suggest a
40% increase in student pedestrians and bicyclists (National Center for
Safe Routes to School, 2017). The city of Seattle also works to promote
AST over and above WSDOT e<U+FB00>orts. As an example, the Seattle De-
partment of Transportation (SDOT) completed 18 SRTS engineering
projects at priority schools in 2015 (Seattle Department of

Transportation, 2016). In addition to SRTS programs, Seattle has im-

plemented a pedestrian master plan (PMP) and a bicycle master plan
(BMP) to encourage walking and biking. SRTS programs have been

integrated into the PMP and BMP implementation schedules.

In this study, the AST data was obtained from a twelve-year student
travel survey, where students were asked their primary transportation
mode for home-to-school travel, collected by the Seattle Department of
Education and Early Learning (SDEEL) and SDOT. Samples were ran-
domly drawn from public school children. To date, the data covers
twelve years, including 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, and
2016. However, not all schools continually participated in the survey.
In total, 75 schools participated, but only 57 of them have responded
more than three times, and only 53 of them have other student-related
information documented and available, such as enrollment, race, and
gender, as shown in Fig. 1. To estimate the longitudinal e<U+FB00>ects, only
schools with at least three observed moments and with student-related
information, are included in the <U+FB01>nal models.
The data used in this analysis was only collected from public
schools. Furthermore, schools are divided into elementary schools,
middle schools, high schools, alternative schools (which includes
schools for special needs students, such as disabled children), and ser-
vice schools (schools that meet speci<U+FB01>c demands, such as college pre-

paration and personalized interests). The data used in this study was
collected from elementary schools (K-5) or elementary and middle

school (K-8) students.
This study considers a large set of variables, including land use, road

network, street elements, tra<U+FB03>c safety, crime rates, and socio-demo-

graphic factors. Since the analytical unit is the school, this study cannot

adjust for individual, household, home-based, or path-based char-

acteristics associated with AST. Built environment variables, including

land use, road network, and street elements, are collected by the Puget

Sound Regional Council (PSRC) and SDOT. Historical crime and colli-

sion data are collected by Seattle Police Department. The socio-demo-

graphic data are based on the State of Washington's OSPI O<U+FB03>ce of

Superintendent of Public Instruction (WS OSPI) and American

Community Survey data (ACS).
While built environment and socio-demographic factors around each
school are continually changing, such changes are usually small. Therefore,
most changes are well controlled across time. However, because of Seattle's
ambitious implementation of the pedestrian master plan and bicycle master
plan over the years, noticeable changes have been occurring to sidewalks
and bike lanes since 2007. Table 1 presents the annual changes in terms of
sidewalk modi<U+FB01>cation1 and bike lane accommodation2 in Seattle.
In terms of crimes, threats and assaults that may occur along student
routes to school are of great parental concern. However, this study only

Sidewalk modi<U+FB01>cation refers to improvements made on streets for walking, such as

providing su<U+FB03>cient right-of-way, connecting to the existing sidewalk network, removing
topographic limitations, promoting pedestrian safety, and replacing pavement.

Bike lane accommodation refers to improvements made on streets for biking, such as
adding cycle tracks, separated/bu<U+FB00>ered bike lanes, and markings for bicycle boulevards.

controls for threats and excludes assaults due to multicollinearity is-
sues. To account for tra<U+FB03>c safety, historical crash data has been em-
ployed to calculate pedestrian and bicycle crash frequency per area.
Both crashes and crimes are measured as time-varying variables, as
shown in Table 2.
Many street element variables were initially considered but ex-
cluded because of multicollinearity, such as tra<U+FB03>c circle count, stop
sign count, road signal count, and the presence of cameras, because
they are mostly installed at intersections. As a convention, density,
diversity (i.e. land use mixture), and design (i.e. intersection/crosswalk
density) of the built environment are also included. The percentage of
steep areas (slope > 40%), the density of street trees, and the percen-
tage of recreational areas, are further included. Finally, as discussed,
children living in larger neighborhoods are less likely to walk or bike to
school due to the increment of travel distance and thus the attendance
area of each school is included.
To adjust for socio-demographic factors, data obtained from WS
OSPI are major inputs into the <U+FB01>nal models. Variables obtained from

WS OSPI are coded as time-varying variables, as shown in Table 3,
including the percentage of students of di<U+FB00>erent races, the percentage
of male students, the enrollment of each school, and the percentage of
students having access to free or reduced-price lunch. Because of mul-
ticollinearity, only the percentages of white and black students, the
percentage of male students, and annual enrollment are included. To
attempt to account for income, the percentage of poverty households3 is
obtained from American Community Survey data (5-year).


3.3. Generalized linear model


This study <U+FB01>ts a generalized linear model (GLM) to capture the long-

itudinal changes in the mode share of walking and biking to school.

Poverty (US Census): People who live in households with low income are in poverty.
“Income thresholds by the o<U+FB03>cial poverty measure are established by tripling the in<U+FB02>a-

tion-adjusted cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 and adjusting for family size, com-
position and the age of the householder.”

Statistical analysis is implemented with a R package called ‘blme’. The GLM
is expressed by Equations (Eqs.) (1) to (4). A conditional expectation
function model can predict changes in the mode share of walking or biking
at school i and occasion t. The school survey in total has 8 occasions from
2005 to 2016. This GLM has subject-speci<U+FB01>c intercepts and slopes, which
allows the walking and biking rate at each school to vary by the initial mode
share and the rate of change over time. Eq. (1) represents the level-1 model,
which follows the traditional linear model speci<U+FB01>cation. The level-2 model
estimates the <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects and the random e<U+FB00>ects that depart from group-
speci<U+FB01>c changes with subject-speci<U+FB01>c intercepts and slopes that are esti-
mated from the level-1 model, as shown in Eqs. (2) and (3). The composite
model is speci<U+FB01>ed by Eq. (4).
Yit = ß0i + ß1i Timeit + eit                                                      (1)

ß0i = ß00 + ß0i Xit + <U+03B6> 0i                                                        (2)

ß1i = ß10 + ß1i Xit + <U+03B6>1i                                                         (3)

where ß0i and ß1i are the estimated parameters that vary across schools i; µit
is the mean of walking and biking mode share at the 53 schools over the 8
occasions t; ß00 is the overall intercept; Timeit is a level-1 time variable, with
the <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ect parameters ß1i. Xi refers to the <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects; Xi*Timeit is the
cross-level product for time changes that interact with the <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ect
parameters ß1i. The composite error is made of <U+03B6>0i + <U+03B6>1iTimeit + eit, where <U+03B6>0i
and <U+03B6>1i are random e<U+FB00>ects of each subject that depart from group-averaged
intercept and slope, and eit is the error term. In this study, only time-varying
variables, cumulative sidewalk modi<U+FB01>cation or bike lane accommodation,

threats, and crashes, are included for modeling the cross-level interaction
e<U+FB00>ects.

This study estimates elasticity of signi<U+FB01>cant variables. Direct elas-

ticity and arc elasticity formulas for continuous and discrete variables
for the generalized linear models are as follows (Ewing and Cervero,

Student assignment plan  0.51    -      0.00 1.00      Seattle Public Schools Board of Directors approved a Student Assignment Plan in 2009, which changed school assignment
policy from a school choice to a neighborhood-based one as of 2010. The policy states: “unless the school designated by
student's home address does not have the appropriate services, the student shall be assigned to a school that has the
appropriate services.” This policy potentially contributes to travel distance reduction of school trips.

Lastly, we <U+FB01>nd that students from schools located in areas with
greater employment density usually are more likely to bike to school
(Broberg and Sarjala, 2015). In areas of greater employment density,
tra<U+FB03>c speed is generally lower, and bike lanes are better planned and
provided, which contributes to a safer environment for student biking.
Crosswalk placement is a cogent part of street connectivity, which is
helpful in promoting student walking to school which this study de-
monstrates.

6. Limitations and future research

A noticeable limitation of this study is bias in school selection. First,
the included schools are all public schools, which leaves students of
private schools undiscussed. Students who attend private schools are
often from households with higher income and better parental educa-
tion, and their parents may be more encouraging of healthy activities
like walking and biking. How walking and biking to school might
change for private school students remains unanswered. Similar studies
need to be done if private school student travel data can be obtained.
Second, the survey assigns a much greater weight to elementary school
students. The <U+FB01>ndings of student biking to school are therefore some-
what biased towards younger children. Future surveys should work to
include more middle school and high school students. Third, as noted in
Fig. 2 and Table 4, the maximum percentage of students biking to

school is 25.50% (in 2008), which is roughly ten times the mean. This
may be due to inconsistencies in data collection or survey administra-
tion such as di<U+FB00>erent ways of invoking students to respond, the sur-
veyors' unclear de<U+FB01>nitions, or some students wanting to advocate sus-
tainable transportation. Yet, there is no clear way to net out inaccurate
cases which creates bias in the data. In the future, careful instruction of
surveyors should control these types of errors. Fourth, this paper uses
area-level averages to infer relationships among various factors for
speci<U+FB01>c sites. Such a design means that factors and outcomes are
averaged for the population in each geographical or temporal unit.
Although this study is valid for hypothesis generation, it is not con-
sidered valid for hypothesis testing regarding area-level variables be-
cause of unmeasured and uncontrolled confounding variables (Cohen,
2005; Freudenheim, 1999). Fifth, the modi<U+FB01>able areal unit problem
(MAUP) may contribute to the inconsistency between <U+FB01>ndings (Mitra
and Buliung, 2014). MAUP is de<U+FB01>ned as a source of spatial bias when
analytical results are sensitive to changes of scale and zoning of units
that are used to measure the built environment (Mitra and Buliung,
2014; Parenteau and Sawada, 2011). In such a context, the relationship
between independent and dependent variables may vary largely across
space and thus one analytical unit cannot be representative for the
entire analysis (Swift et al., 2008). Though this study tries to mitigate
the impact of MAUP through careful research design under di<U+FB00>erent
spatial units (Parenteau and Sawada, 2011; Swift et al., 2008), it does
not completely get rid of the risk of biased estimation resulting from
MAUP.
