    250 m buffer around home/              The use of a 200 or 250 m buffer is most common in empirical research that measures the built environment around travel routes
       school location                     (Schlossberg et al., 2006). A 250 m distance is roughly equivalent to a 2.5-min walking distance for an average adult.
    Area: 0.2 sq km
    400 m buffer around home/              400 m is equivalent to a 5-min walking distance for an average child (Mitra et al., 2010). Some researchers have assumed this
       school location                     distance to be a reasonable walking distance for children (McMillan, 2007; Mitra et al., 2010; Yarlagadda and Srinivasan, 2008).

    800 m buffer around home/              800 m is equivalent to a 10-min walking distance for an average child (Panter et al., 2010).

    1000 m buffer around home/             Sometimes used in adult active-travel behavior research (Frank et al., 2007), a 1000 m (i.e., 1 km) distance is roughly equivalent to a
       school location                     10-to-12 min walking distance for an average adult. One study on children’s school travel has used this distance to de<U+FB01>ne the
