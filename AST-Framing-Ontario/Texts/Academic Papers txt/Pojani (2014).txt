passing mostly single-family homes, peri-urban settlements have
relatively high density as well.
    The inner city is vibrant and offers private services and ameni-
ties comparable to Western European cities. This is a direct result
of the densi<U+FB01>cation, the <U+FB01>ne-grained land use pattern, and the eco-
nomic transformation. On the other hand, the public sector obtains
only meager revenues due to the fact that much of the income
within the country is earned through remittances and informal
channels and is therefore not taxable. For more background infor-
mation on Tirana, refer to Pojani (2010).
    In terms of mobility, private car ownership was prohibited dur-
ing communism. However, unlike other socialist states Albania did
not create a decent public transport system. After the transition,
when restrictions were removed, car ownership skyrocketed.
Now, more than half of the city’s households own a car. The middle
and high income portions of the population are increasingly car-
dependent. Not only were cars purchased to ful<U+FB01>ll mobility needs
(i.e. to counterbalance the poor quality of public transport, pedes-
trian, and bike facilities), but are also seen as symbols of freedom
and social status.
    The shift from public and non-motorized transport modes
towards private cars has led to a host of problems including enor-
mous health and environmental damage. The capital was not
designed to accommodate cars and is chocked with traf<U+FB01>c much
