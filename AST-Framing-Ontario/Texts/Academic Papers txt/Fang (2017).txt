Abstract
This study broadens understanding of how children’s travel modes influence the development of
their spatial cognition, specifically the development of their spatial representation of home–school
routes. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey and a cognitive mapping process at an
elementary school in northern Taiwan. The sample, which comprised 521 Grades 1–6 children
aged 7–12 years, was analysed through linear regressions. Empirical results indicate that the use
of independent, active or non-motorised transportation modes improved the children’s spatial
cognition regarding their home–school routes. This study not only provides new knowledge
about the relationships between travel modes and the spatial cognition of children, but also iden-
tifies policy directions in relation to school transportation and the development of spatial cogni-
tion in children.
