3. Data collection
3.1. Case study and sample
    Given the need to explore children’s perceptions and behavior
across multiple spatial and social domains – household, school,
recreation, social networks – a case study approach was used to
understand the children’s realized and potential functionings
within their walkable neighborhood activity space. A case study
approach allows a rich understanding of the social and built envi-
ronments contexts that are relevant to children’s wellbeing. The
case study was a primary school in a suburb of Perth, WA, approx-
imately 12 km from the Perth CBD, and 5 km from the coastal city
of Fremantle. Fig. 3 illustrates the regional context of the case
study.
