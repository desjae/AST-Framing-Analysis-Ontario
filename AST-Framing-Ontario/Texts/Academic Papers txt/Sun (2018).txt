                                                          between built environments and school commuting behavior (that is, mode choice, travel time to and

1. Introduction
     Physical activity has many known health bene<U+FB01>ts including improvements to cardiovascular health, lung function, bone strength, and
mental health, and a decreased risk of diabetes, obesity, cancer, and overall mortality (Bauman et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012). Studies have
shown that levels of physical activity among children are low. Ninety-three percent of Canadian children ages 5–11 do not meet the
recommended physical activity guidelines of at least 60 min of daily moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (Gray et al., 2014). In
the UK, the proportion of children aged 5 to 15 years meeting recommendations between 2008 and 2012 declined from 28% to 21% (Panter
et al., 2008; Townsend et al., 2015). In the USA, 42% of children ages 6–11 year obtain the recommended 60 min of physical activity,
whereas only 8% of adolescents achieve this goal (Troiano et al., 2008). In China, 77% of students in primary and middle schools failed to
meet the recommendation in the “2010 National Physical Fitness and Health Surveillance” survey (Zhang et al., 2012). Low levels of physical
activity may predispose children to developing childhood obesity, which has become a global epidemic (Boreham and Riddoch, 2001). The

journey to school is a potentially important opportunity for increasing children's daily physical activity (Fulton et al., 2005; Rowland et al.,
2003). Encouraging active commuting to school (ACS) can further foster healthy active commuting habits during later adolescence and
adulthood (Merom et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2014).
    Studies in Western cities have shown that fewer than a half of all ACS trips are by walking or bicycling mode even for distances
under one mile (Martin et al., 2007; Rothman et al., 2014b; Salmon et al., 2007). Little is known about the pattern of school
commuting in mainland China where physical inactivity has increased among children in recent decades (Kerr et al., 2016; Zong and
Li, 2014). Urban planning guidelines recommend that the service area of a primary school is at around 500 m radius bu<U+FB00>er, and a
middle school is at 1000 m (Shenzhen Planning and Land Resource Committee, 2017). With the planning guidelines, the “attending
nearby school” policy restricts primary school admission to children living within a de<U+FB01>ned catchment neighborhoods based on
parental hukou (household registration) and housing ownership (Feng and Lu, 2013), which ensures that children in mainland China
live within walking distance of an a<U+FB03>liated primary school. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of the catchment neighborhoods for a
primary school in Shenzhen, China. Education resource planning in China is strikingly di<U+FB00>erent from many Western countries, where
parents can often choose which schools their children attend, with often only families with limited resources (e.g., fewer cars)
sending their children to the local school (Bostock, 2001; Goodman et al., 2012). However, there is limited research assessing the
proportion of children in China who live within walking distance to school who actively commute.
    Previous studies have attempted to promote physical activity of children by focusing on time at school or leisure time activities. Research has
                                                                       252

shown built environment correlates with physical activity of children. However, links between the built environment and ACS has received less
attention (D’Haese et al., 2015b; van Goeverden and de Boer, 2013). A few environmental factors associated with ACS have been examined such
as: distance; connectivity of streets; tra<U+FB03>c calming on streets; path infrastructure; aesthetic qualities; intersection density; safety; and land use
mix (Curtis et al., 2015; Ewing et al., 2004; Larouche et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2009; Panter et al., 2008; Pont et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2011).
Apart from a consistent negative association between distance, <U+FB01>ndings of the built environment indicators associated with children's ACS were
inconsistent and nuanced (Wong et al., 2011). For example, the relationship between street connectivity and ACS has been positive in some
studies and negative in others (Carlson et al., 2014; Panter et al., 2010). Some studies reported null association between land use mix and ACS
(Ewing et al., 2004; Panter et al., 2010), others reported positive relationship (McMillan, 2005; Rosenberg et al., 2009). The inconsistencies
potentially hinder designing e<U+FB00>ective interventions to promote ACS.
    Some researchers suggested that objective built environment elements in<U+FB02>uence ACS of children. While the inconsistent use of spatial
concepts, including bu<U+FB00>er size, objective measures, and quality of pedestrian network datasets, limits the ability to draw conclusions (Pont et al.,
2009; Wong et al., 2011). Other studies found that parental perceptions are more in<U+FB02>uential (Fyhri and Hjorthol, 2009; Mackett, 2013), which
have focused predominantly on distance from home to school and safety. Fewer studies have been conducted on children's own experiences of
the walking environment to school (Fusco et al., 2012). Evenson identi<U+FB01>ed positive associations between knowledge of the number of desti-
nations in the neighborhood and ACS of girls (Ortega et al., 2006). In another study of Australian girls, no association was found between having
convenience stores near the home and walking for transport during the week (Carver et al., 2005).
    Most of the previous ACS studies were conducted in urban areas of the USA, Canada, Australia and Western Europe. In China, less
is known about the role of physical and perceived built environments on children's ACS. Though some commonalities may exist across
countries, reviews of the literature suggest that how the environment impacts ACS is not universal (Van Kann et al., 2015). USA,
Canada, Australia and Western Europe have di<U+FB00>erent urban layouts and walking culture, and most importantly di<U+FB00>erent education
planning system, compared to China. Studies in Australia indicated that children residing in denser and urban areas are signi<U+FB01>cantly
associated with more ACS (Curtis et al., 2015). There is a lack of research in urban areas in China, which have much greater density
than their western counterparts (Sun et al., 2017a).
    Understanding of the local context through examining both objective and perceived built environment characteristics is essential for
identifying e<U+FB00>ective intervention strategies to promote ACS (Larouche et al., 2015; Rojas Lopez and Wong, 2017). The investigation of built
environmental correlates of ACS in a developing country such as China is urgently needed to reverse the rapid trend towards inactivity (Lu
et al., 2017). The purpose of this paper is to examine this relationship by looking at a range of objective and subjective factors that may
impact children's multiple aspects of ACS in China, taking into consideration China's “attending nearby school” education system.
2. Methods
2.1. Study areas and populations
    Four primary schools located in di<U+FB00>erent city districts of Shenzhen, a megacity with a population of over 10 million in the south of mainland
China, were systematically selected for this study. The selection of the schools is based on the criterions of geographic locations of the school
(city center or fringe), density, greenery diversity, and representative of the built environment. Types of the catchment neighborhoods of each
school include open and gated communities. The open communities are self-built urban villages and other public housing neighborhoods. The
gated communities are built for residents from a range of socio-economic backgrounds, which in China are di<U+FB00>erent from in Western countries
where gated communities are often walled-o<U+FB00> enclaves of houses where more a<U+FB04>uent people live (Sun et al., 2017b).
    The four primary schools comprise of 28 catchment neighborhoods in total. The students are mostly from those neighborhoods
according to the “attending nearby school” policy. Study participants were recruited from the school sites instead of neighborhoods.
Two recruiting methods were applied: i) subjects were intercepted arriving at and leaving school; and ii) in classroom surveys. All
surveys are interviewer administered. Four trained interviewers administrated the questionnaire, and explained the items if children
had questions. Data were collected from October to November 2015. All participants and their parents provided informed consent.
The Ethics Committee of Peking University approved this study.
2.2. Active commuting behaviors
    Active commuting behaviors were collected using four measures. Self-reported travel mode was assessed, with response options of
walking, bicycling, automobile, public transit, and other. Self-reported daily travel time to and from school was assessed, with
answers categorized as less than 5 min, 5–10 min, 10–15 min, and greater than 15 min. We asked subjects if they had di<U+FB00>erent routes
to and from school, with response options being exactly the same, totally di<U+FB00>erent, and partially di<U+FB00>erent. Commuting patterns were
categorized into binary data as active (walking or bicycling) vs. non-active (automobile, transit, other). Travel time was categorized
as less than 10 min vs. 10 min or more. Route choices were categorized as same vs. di<U+FB00>erent.
    Age, gender and companionship were collected as covariates. The commuting companionship was measured by an item with
options of: alone, classmates or friends, parents, and grandparents or nannies.
2.3. Neighborhood-level environmental measures
    We measured <U+FB01>ve neighborhood-level built environmental characteristics: i) pedestrian network distance from the neighborhood
geographic center to the school gate; ii) density of neighborhood entrances, de<U+FB01>ned as the number of entrances in every 1000 m of
                                                                         253

G. Sun et al.                                                                                             Journal of Transport & Health 8 (2018) 251–261
neighborhood boundaries. The entrance is where people/children can enter into the neighborhoods. It could be road intersections at
the boundary of an open community. It could also be the gates of a gated community. iii) sidewalk ratio along motorized roads; iv)
ratio of tra<U+FB03>c calming roads, de<U+FB01>ned as roads jointly used by pedestrians and cars equipped with tra<U+FB03>c calming techniques (Melia,
2012); v) permeable pedestrian network ratio, de<U+FB01>ned as the number of small alleys and informal paths that are routes not o<U+FB03>cial or
legally sanctioned but frequently used by local residents and children.
    These measures were calculated using a detailed pedestrian network we constructed using high resolution aerial photographs,
street views, and <U+FB01>eld visits with GPS ground truthing techniques, to avoid the missing pedestrian network issue of urban road
networks that has previously been shown to confound built environment and active travel studies (Chin et al., 2008; Iacono et al.,
2010; Sun et al., 2015; Tal and Handy, 2012). We identi<U+FB01>ed gate access points – locations that allow a pedestrian free access to the
school catchment neighborhood – by <U+FB01>eld observation, as enclosure of gated communities has been reported but does not appear in
o<U+FB03>cial records (Webster et al., 2017). All measures were calculated using geographic information systems (ArcGIS 10.3.1, Esri, USA).
2.4. Perceived environmental measures
    Perceptions of the route environments were assessed using a 24-item questionnaire. The questionnaire was based on a review of studies
assessing the relationship between environmental attributes and ACS behaviors. We adapted items from the validated Neighborhood
Environmental Walkability Scale for Youth (Rosenberg et al., 2009). This questionnaire was used for 11- to 12-year old children in a previous
study in Taiwan, who share the same culture and language with our study samples (Sheu-jen et al., 2010). It also has been applied in children
in Belgium (D’Haese et al., 2015a). We adjusted items for di<U+FB00>erences from Western countries to better re<U+FB02>ect China's physical environment
(Day, 2016; Day et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2017a). We conducted pilot validation using three waves of focus group studies on 21 children. The
researchers discussed with respondents what they believed the questions were asking, if there were any vocabularies they did not understand.
The questionnaire was revised until no ambiguities remained. Items, using a four-point Likert-scale ranging from the most negative to the
most positive result for that situation, were constructed by semantic di<U+FB00>erential principles.
    Principal component analysis using varimax rotation was applied to identify the groups of related environmental attributes. Five
factors, accounting for 52% of the variance, were identi<U+FB01>ed from the analysis. Six items were excluded from further analysis because
they cross-loaded across several of the factors or did not <U+FB01>t with the interpretation of the factors. Loadings ranged from 0.46 to 0.76
across the <U+FB01>ve factors. Five dimensional factors were obtained for the perceived environment characteristics: permeability, route
across public open space, route across points of interest (e.g., stationers, snack shops), route aesthetics, and safety. Appendix A is a
full list of study items, factor groupings, and response options.
    Items in each factor were summed to provide a total score for each category of perceived environmental attribute. These summed scores
were then divided by the number of items in each category. This facilitates comparisons across the categories, with all having a <U+FB01>nal score out of
four. The scores of permeability, route across public open space, route across points of interest, route aesthetics and safety were transformed into
categorical variables with three levels: low (a less positive perception of the environment); moderate; or high (a highly positive perception of the
environment). The cut-o<U+FB00> points used for these levels were those that most closely approximated the tertiles of the distributions.
2.5. Statistical analysis: Multilevel modeling
    Multilevel binary logistic regression models were used to examine the associations of the neighborhood-level environmental
characteristics and individual-level perceived environmental factors with the four ACS behaviors. All models were adjusted for age,
gender and companionship. We standardized the neighborhood-level variables. All analyses were conducted in R (Version 3.4.2).
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive analysis
    The distribution of school commuting mode, travel times, and route di<U+FB00>erences to and from school are shown in Table 1. A
neighborhood group-based descriptive analysis of the neighborhood-level environmental measures, the individual-level perceived
factors, and covariates are shown in Appendix B.
    The average network distance for the 28 neighborhoods was 575 m from the geographic centre of catchment neighborhood to
school [SD = 267; min = 206 m, max = 1303 m]. Descriptive statistics of the neighborhood-level variables include: ‘density of
entrances of the neighborhood’ [mean = 4.1, SD = 3.4], ‘ratio of sidewalk along motorized road’ [mean = 0.7, SD = 0.3], ‘ratio of
tra<U+FB03>c calming road’ [mean = 0.5, SD = 0.3], and ‘ratio of permeable pedestrian network’ [mean = 0.2, SD = 0.3].
    We recruited 1,090 children, of which 805 (74%) lived within the school catchment neighborhoods and were included in data
analyses. Participants were 48% female, with a mean age of 11 years (SD = 1.2, range 9–14), with most children between the ages of
10 to 12 years (78%). Thirty-nine percent used di<U+FB00>erent routes for commuting to and from school. Thirty-eight percent of participants
commuted to school alone, 49% commuted with classmates, and 13% commuted with parents or grandparents.
    There were stark di<U+FB00>erences in commuting patterns between children who lived within and outside of school catchment
neighborhoods. For children living within school catchment neighborhoods (N = 765, after deleting missing values), the majority
(87%) walked or cycled to school, while few (6%) arrived to school by their parents’ cars. For children living outside of school
catchment neighborhoods (N = 285), 22.4% walked or cycled to school with 23% arriving by car. Fifty-one percent of children
commuted to school by bus or metro.

3.2. Multilevel models
    Intra-class correlation (ICC1) is used to assess the reliability of individual data aggregated at neighborhood group level in the
hierarchical models. Table 2 shows the multilevel binary logistic regression modeling of the built environment correlates of ACS
behaviors of children living in Shenzhen, China.
3.2.1. Active commuting
    Neighborhood di<U+FB00>erences accounted for 17% of the variance in explaining school commute mode choice. Distance to school was in-
versely associated with active mode choice [OR = 0.33, CI = 0.20–0.56]. Neighborhoods with greater density of entrances were associated
with a greater likelihood of active mode choice [OR = 3.13, CI = 1.21–8.11]. Several perceived characteristics of the built environment
were associated with active commuting. A moderate number of points of interest along the commuting route predicted active commuting to
school [OR = 5.64, CI = 2.79–11.38]. A greater route aesthetics was also associated with a greater likelihood for active travel. Perceived
safety was signi<U+FB01>cantly correlated with active commuting. Having a high degree of perceived open space along the route was negatively
associated with active commuting [OR = 0.32, CI = 0.15–0.69]. Female students were less likely to actively commute to school.
    The companionship in<U+FB02>uenced the active mode choice. Compared with students who traveled alone, those who traveled with parents
[OR = 0.03, CI = 0.01–0.09] or with grandparents/nannies [OR = 0.12, CI = 0.03–0.48] were less likely to actively commute.
3.2.2. Travel time
    Neighborhood di<U+FB00>erences accounted for 5–6% of the variance in predicted travel times to and from school. A longer distance
predicted a longer commuting time. A denser permeable pedestrian network did not reduce travel time to and from school. Ratio of
tra<U+FB03>c calming road was positively related to travel time from home to school [OR = 1.43, CI = 1.06–1.91]. Females had shorter
travel times from school to home [OR = 0.70, CI = 0.51–0.98].
3.2.3. Route di<U+FB00>erence between to and from school
    Neighborhood di<U+FB00>erences accounted for 4% of the variance in predicted route di<U+FB00>erences. Having a high degree of perceived
permeability was negatively associated with using di<U+FB00>erent routes for commuting between to and from school [OR = 0.55, CI =
0.34–0.89]. A moderate number of perceived points of interest along the commuting route positively associated with di<U+FB00>erent route
choices [OR = 1.60, CI = 1.14–2.25]. The safety is related to whether children want to explore the environment by di<U+FB00>erent routes.
A high degree of perceived safety was associated with a high likelihood of using di<U+FB00>erent routes to and from school [OR = 1.55, CI =
1.06–2.28]. Compared to independent commuters, children traveling with classmates and friends [OR = 0.57, CI = 0.41–0.81] or
parents [OR = 0.55, CI = 0.21–0.99] were less likely to use di<U+FB00>erent routes to and from school.
    In summary, distance was shown to be consistently negatively associated with active commuting to school and with longer travel
times to and from school. A higher ratio of permeable pedestrian network did not yield a shorter travel time, and perceived high
permeability was unlikely to encourage children to use di<U+FB00>erent routes to and from school. Perceived routes aesthetics greatly
impacted active commuting, having the largest odds ratio for predicting active commuting in the model. A higher degree of perceived
safety encouraged students to use active modes of travel. Perceived safety also can encourage students to choose di<U+FB00>erent routes to
and from school to explore the environment. Independent travelers were more likely to be active commuters and choose di<U+FB00>erent
routes to and from school, compared to those travelling with companions.

4. Discussion
    Living within walking distance from school is a government-led planning policy initiative for school-age children in mainland
China. In this study, we investigated the school commuting pattern of children living in Shenzhen, and examined the perceived built
environmental characteristics associated with active commuting behaviors. We found objective built environment characteristics at
the neighborhood level and perceived built environment attributes at the individual level are associated with active commuting to
school in children who living within walking-distance neighborhoods. This study highlights the importance of considering the local
context of school catchment planning in understanding ACS in mainland China.
    We found that nearly three quarters of children live within a half a kilometre from school, indicating that the “attending nearby
school” policy has resulted in most students living within walking distance to school. The vast majority (87%) of children who lived
within walking distance to school actively commuted to school (either by foot or bicycle), and only 6% arrived by car. On the
contrary, the ratio of walking and cycling was considerably lower (22%) among children who lived outside the school catchment
neighborhoods, while the ratio of children arriving by car was greater (23%). Previous studies have found ACS rates of 50–55% in
Canada (Buliung et al., 2009), and 48% in the United States among children who live within walking distance to school (Martin et al.,
2007; Salmon et al., 2007). In a study of Australian children, even when using a broad de<U+FB01>nition of active commuting to include any
                                                                              256

G. Sun et al.                                                                                        Journal of Transport & Health 8 (2018) 251–261
leg of a trip to or from school that includes walking or cycling, only one third of children were found to be active commuters (Merom
et al., 2006). It is reasonable to infer that the high ACS rate in our study suggests the ‘attending nearby school’ policy has been
successful at promoting active commuting, and that the local context of school catchment planning is leading to very di<U+FB00>erent
commuting patterns than observed in many Western communities.
    Perceived built environment characteristics were associated with active commuting to school. Interestingly, routes that were
perceived to be more aesthetically pleasing were positively associated with active commuting modes, and having the most impact on
active mode choice among environmental factors. This <U+FB01>nding is di<U+FB00>erent from a literature review <U+FB01>nding that environment aes-
thetics were unimportant in children's decisions surrounding commuting to school (D’Haese et al., 2015b). This di<U+FB00>erence might be
due to Shenzhen city context, with its subtropical climate and dominant concrete high-rises, o<U+FB00>ering a recognizable building
landscape with a tree canopy that provides shade that might greatly encourage ACS.
    Routes across open spaces were inversely associated with active travel modes. Previous studies that have examined the relationship
between open spaces and ACS have found mixed results. Parks and recreation facilities were not found to be associated with observed
walking, but were associated with increased reported walking (Kerr et al., 2007; Rothman et al., 2014b; Zhu et al., 2011). The neighborhoods
represented in this study include several gated communities. In China, contemporary gated communities are usually large in size, involving
hundreds of acres and thousands of residents. The built forms within these communities tend to be high-rise arrangements with much of the
ground area devoted to open space (Miao, 2003), but spatially segregated from the surrounding areas. In contrast, open communities in
China have better pedestrian accessibility but lack open spaces. The perception of the presence of open spaces might therefore be a less
important factor than the spatial segregation of the gated communities in determining children's school commuting behaviors. This may also
be partially con<U+FB01>rmed by the <U+FB01>ndings that at a higher density of neighbourhood entrances – indicating a lesser spatial segregation of the
community – was positively associated with the activity commuting.
    Safety was another concern identi<U+FB01>ed in this study. We found that children who reported higher perceived safety were more likely
to use alternate routes to and from school. This suggests that perceived safety of the environment may encourage children to actively
explore their environment. General safety and tra<U+FB03>c safety have been found to be associated with ACS in North America and
Australia but not in Europe (D’Haese et al., 2015b). This might be due in part to the increased dangers of walking and cycling to
school in the US and Australia, due to substantial urban sprawl (Pucher and Dijkstra, 2000; Rothman et al., 2015, 2014a).
    We found that neighborhood level built environment characteristics were associated with ACS. Distance was consistently in-
versely correlated with ACS. Having more neighborhood entrances was associated with active mode choice. However, a higher ratio
of permeable routes did not appear to translate into shorter travel times for school commuting. Permeable routes are more prevalent
in open communities than gated communities. In both focus group and survey discussions, children reported the lack of light in
permeable routes as a deterrent to using those routes. Furthermore, there are many e-bikes using these narrow routes which was also
cited as a tra<U+FB03>c safety concern (potential collisions).
    Using multilevel models, we found that neighborhood di<U+FB00>erences explained di<U+FB00>erences in active commuting behaviors.
Speci<U+FB01>cally, neighborhood level built environment characteristic accounted for variations in ACS. These important <U+FB01>ndings, in this
study involving a simultaneous analysis of neighborhoods and children provide support for the notion that the built environment
should be taken into consideration when planning and promoting active commuting to school policies in China.
4.1. Implications
    This study revealed that various physical and perceived built environment characteristics e<U+FB00>ect active commuting to school in
China. These <U+FB01>ndings could assist urban/transport planners, public health practitioners and school planners to improve ACS in China.
    Aesthetic and safety features in the school neighborhood environment were correlated with ACS among children. Increasing ratio of
permeable routes alone might be not able to promote children's ACS. More attentions are needed to improve the quality of the routes. Urban
designer could enhance lighting in and around such street to improve the use of permeable routes. In addition, we found route aesthetics can
encourage children's ACS. Practitioners can intervene aesthetics by increasing street greenery and tree shading. The attractiveness of the
routes will get enhanced by tree shading, especially in the subtropical Shenzhen city where the weather is hot.
    Permeable routes may also limit car tra<U+FB03>c and increase safety. In our study areas, however, many e-bikes were observed on
permeable streets, increasing the collision risk for children. Tra<U+FB03>c safety such as tra<U+FB03>c volume and speed have also been identi<U+FB01>ed
as factor that in<U+FB02>uences school travel mode decisions. Designers can employ tra<U+FB03>c calming measures including, using devices (e.g.,
piles, speed bumps) to restrict e-bikes activity in permeable alleys, lower speeds in motorized roads by curving the street, and pushing
tra<U+FB03>c out of collector routes in school catchment areas (Brown et al., 2017). Streets and permeable routes may then o<U+FB00>er greater
opportunities for both active transport and leisure-time physical activity of children.
    We found that children who are active commuters tended to explore spaces when they traveled independently. Studies on independent
mobility suggested that children who have the freedom to play outdoors and travel actively without adult supervision accumulate more physical
activity than those who do not (Schoeppe et al., 2013). One example of a policy proposal could be for school planners in China to recommend
that children actively commute to school for one week of every semester, and use di<U+FB00>erent routes during ACS to explore the environment of
their neighborhoods. This ACS week activity should ideally be done by children independently, without companionship of parents, provided the
children are age appropriate, and chaperoned by an adult (parents or teachers) at major road intersections.
4.2. Limitations and strengths
    This study has several limitations. The study was restricted to a single geographical area, the city of Shenzhen, a subtropical
                                                                     257

G. Sun et al.                                                                                  Journal of Transport & Health 8 (2018) 251–261
megacity in China with a high population density, and these results may only be generalizable to similar city contexts. The cross-
sectional study design makes it impossible to draw conclusions about causal relationships of the “attending nearby school” policy and
ACS patterns. Nevertheless, the strikingly di<U+FB00>erence in ACS patterns between children who live within and outside of school
catchment neighborhoods suggests that there may be a signi<U+FB01>cant impact of the policy on active travel in China. Our active com-
muting behaviors are based on self-report which may be subject to recall bias and may not capture all domains of this activity. We
aimed to assess similar themes of the perceived individual level and objective neighborhood level measures of the built environment,
however our measures do not match perfectly (Lin and Moudon, 2010). Detailed streets audits (Cerin et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2017a)
might help relate perceived measures to their objective counterparts and help optimize the use of these <U+FB01>ndings in formulating
planning recommendations.
    This study has several strengths, including sample size, novelty, and the use of multilevel statistical methods. The study's large
sample allows for a representative description of children's perceptions on route preferences and the perceived import of built
environment attributes. We provide, to our knowledge, the <U+FB01>rst description of children's commuting behaviors under the unique
school catchment planning system in mainland China. This information is especially important as there are currently few such studies
in Asia. We used multilevel modelling to control for neighborhood level environmental characteristics as a way to better understand
Chinese children's perceptions of their built environment and their school commuting behaviors.
5. Conclusion
    Living within a designated school catchment neighborhood in mainland China was associated with active commuting to school.
This study reports on the active commuting patterns of children in China and o<U+FB00>ers an important addition to the literature, providing
the Chinese context for school commuting patterns, which represents an important juxtaposition to Western studies. In Asia, none of
the physical environment attributes previously studied in the international literature have been su<U+FB03>ciently investigated to draw
conclusions with regards to active commuting to school (D’Haese et al., 2015b). Our <U+FB01>ndings may support urban planners and health
practitioners to intervene the built environment to promote ACS for children living in Shenzhen and other similar cities.
