Walk Zone Maps
To encourage active travel and help you find alternate drop off locations located near the school, STS mapped
out potential locations for the schools listed below. It is up to each parent to decide if the suggestions are
suitable for their students based on their student’s skills and abilities.
Active Travel is any kind of human powered transportation – like walking, cycling, or riding a scooter. Students
who choose active travel to and from school show improved physical and mental health and arrive at school

more alert and ready to learn.
Parents and guardians also play a big role in school zone safety. Cars dropping students off create traffic
mayhem around school sites. Consider a “Drive to 5” location. These sites are located only a 5-minute walk
away from the school. Give your student a chance to get some exercise and make the school sites safer for
everyone by using a nearby location as your meeting point.
Even though it is referred to as a “Drive to 5”, you can walk or wheel your student to the 5-minute location, help
build their independence by letting them travel the last 5 minutes by themselves.
