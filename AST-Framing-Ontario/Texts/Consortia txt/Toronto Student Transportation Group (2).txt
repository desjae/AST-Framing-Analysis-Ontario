 A school travel plan is a living document that is designed to identify obstacles and provide solutions to help our
 students access education. A school travel plan is not owned by one individual or school but is an amalgamation and
 synthesis of information and ideas brought forward by the school community as a means to help students get to and
 from school. One of the primary goals to a school travel plan is to ensure that active and healthy transportation
 choices are championed and decisions in the community and the school are designed to help facilitate those choices.
 Some of the common barriers identi ed in many school travel plans include:
         Infrastructure related (no sidewalks, no connecting walkways, deteriorating road/sidewalk fabric etc.)
         Safety Concerns (no crossing guards, stranger danger, traf c around the
         school etc.)
         Policies (School Board busing policies are too lenient / too stringent)
 School travel plans do rely heavily on the school itself being a leader of
 change. Check out some of the strategies some schools have used to promote
 active and healthy transportation choices and see if anything resonates with
 you. Changing how we make transportation choices will be a multi-
 generational endeavour but it all starts with these small steps and decisions to
 make a difference.
 The following schools have developed school travel plans in conjunction with
 their community partners. If your school community is interested in
 developing a plan for your school please let us know and we will help
 facilitate the discussion to start the process.
