Active Transportation
Help support student success through Active Transportation!
Did you know that walking or rolling to school not only improves children’s health but can help improve academic performance? The
increased physical activity improves alertness and attention span during the school day! An active school commute also reduces road
congestion in school zones and contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions – it’s a win-win for everyone!
For those that can’t walk the whole way, parking away from the school and walking the rest of the way (also known as Walk-a-Block) is
another great way to add active transportation to your daily commute. Walking or rolling even part-way reduces traffic stress and
increases the quality of time spent with your children.
Help play a role in encouraging active transportation by learning the multiple benefits of walking to school.
Below are resources and information on OSTA’s programs available to teachers, parents and guardians.                           
Find out more about our Walking Route Maps and Walking School Bus Program
  - Walking Route Maps by School - Find your walking route to school
    Walking Route maps are designed to indicate the quickest and most direct routes to school. The maps include
    the location of traffic lights and signs, crossing guards and any hazards in the neighbourhood. The routes are
    identified by directional arrows that lead towards the school.

  Maps are updated throughout the summer in preparation for the beginning of school in September.

- Walk-a-Block Maps by School - Park away from the school and walk the rest of the way
  Walk-a-Block maps are designed to encourage parents who drive their children to school, to park 5 to 10 minutes away
  from the school and walk the rest of the way. By using Walk-a-Block, traffic congestion is dispersed away from the
  congested school area, creating a safer school zone for all.
  The maps identify a 400 and 800-metre radius around the school. They also identify neighbourhood street names,
  pathways and potential quiet places to park.                                                                                         
- Walk&Roll Meetup by School - Walk as a small group to school
  Walk&Roll Meetup Maps are designed to encourage students to meetup at designated locations and walk as a
  small group to school. Walking as a small group, children benefit from “safety in numbers”. Walk&Roll Meetups
  are unsupervised and designed for children grades 4 and up. The Walk&Roll Meetup stops were conveniently
  selected based on the location of walking students in the area. The maps also identify recommended walking
  routes to school, location of traffic lights and signs, crossing guards and any hazards in the neighbourhood
  Walking routes should be planned ahead of time and practiced before the first day of school or the first day of walking.
  Maps will constantly be updated throughout the summer in preparation for the beginning of school in September.
- Walking School Bus Information - Walk as a group with a professional leader
  The Walking School Bus (WSB) is designed to promote active transportation and healthy living. Students
  walk to school with a group of up to 10 peers and a professional leader, following a specific route and
  schedule. Walking to school is a safe, convenient, healthy and fun way for your child to travel to school with
  their friends. It helps them get the daily physical activity they need to be healthy and concentrate better at
  school.
  Similar to an adult crossing guard, each WSB has a paid leader who has been trained by the Ottawa Safety
  Council, screened and first-aid certified to walk with your child to school. They follow a specific route and
  schedule which has been approved by OSTA and its partners. OSTA’s Walking School Bus (WSB) program is
  offered in 13 Ottawa schools.
  Hybrid Walking School Bus
  Similar to the Walking School Bus, the Hybrid Walking School Bus (HWSB) promotes active transportation and healthy living by having students walk to
  school with a group of 10 to 30 peers and a professional leader and trained volunteers, following a specific route and schedule.
  Each HWSB has one paid leader who has been trained by the Ottawa Safety Council, screened and first-aid certified.

   HWSB’s will have at least one additional volunteer leader who will also be screened and trained by Ottawa Safety Council to walk with your child to sch
   Two special schools have been selected to participate in OSTA’s new Hybrid Walking School Bus (HWSB).
   Volunteer Walking School Bus Leaders Wanted!
   In the search for ways to make walking to school safer, more fun and more convenient, communities are
   finding that walking school buses can make a real difference. A Walking School Bus (WSB) is simply a group
   of children who walk to school together under adult Supervision, following a specific route and schedule.
   Are you walking your child to school every day? Are you retired and looking for an opportunity to get some
   exercise and help the students get to school safely?
   OSTA and the Ottawa Safety Council are looking for community volunteers to walk children to school. Flexible
   schedules and training are provided at no cost to you!

 - School Active Transportation Planning Information and Signup
   Active school travel makes a difference, find out how your school can be part of the change.
   This past fall, OSTA conducted an online survey to better understand how students were getting to school and if any traffic impacts were observed around
   their school site. The survey results showed that schools that have participated in the School Active Transportation Planning (SATP) have a higher uptake
   of active transportation than non-SATP schools.
   School Active Transportation Planning (SATP) is a community-based approach for increasing rates of active school travel. Based on Green Communities
   Canada model of School Travel Planning (STP), the SATP process brings together stakeholders at the school and regional levels to create and implement
   action plans that use all five E’s (education, encouragement, engineering, enforcement, and evaluation) to:
       address travel-related issues at schools; and
       encourage students in the walk zone to walk or wheel for the school journey (and encourage students in the bus zone to ride the school bus)
   The SATP process is guided and supported by an SATP Facilitator who brings everyone together, coordinates activities, and uses the STP Toolkit to
   compile a School Travel Plan.
   As part of their commitment to advancing active and sustainable transportation options for Ottawa residents, EnviroCentre delivers School Active
   Transportation Planning services to local OCDSB and OCSB schools. These services are delivered as part of the School Active Transportation
   Program on behalf of OSTA and the City of Ottawa and in partnership with Ottawa Public Health.
   Eleven schools in Ottawa are currently participating in the School Active Transportation Program (SATP). Each year, hands-up classroom surveys are
   conducted over five days in all SATP schools. This historical data provides some context and points of comparison for the 2020 OSTA Transportation
   Survey.
  A copy of the survey results overview can be downloaded here.
  Help encourage families to choose active and sustainable modes of transportation for their children’s daily commute by becoming a SATP
  School.

- School Active Transportation Toolkit - Learn how to plan your Walk to School Day Event
  What can a school do to increase the number of students choosing active transportation? Make it fun! Show
  the school community that your school encourages walking! You can do that by having a few dedicated days each year
  when the school comes together and celebrates active transportation with a Walk to School Day event.
  Sometimes known as an “I Walk” event, a Walk to School Day event is a fun and easy way for families to try active
  transportation for the first time and to celebrate those already walking and wheeling every day.
  In order to help you plan your first event, or make an existing event even better, the Ottawa Student Transportation
  Authority (OSTA), in collaboration with EnviroCentre, has prepared this toolkit. It is free to use and full of ideas, planning
  tips and tools.
- Pitter Patter Grant - Information and application

   School Active Transportation (SAT) initiatives for elementary students.
   The OSTA Pitter Patter Grant is a micro-grant of up to $250, available to local schools who wish to implement or support a SAT initiative during the current
