     ABSTRACT                                                                             KEYWORDS
     To explain and predict active school travel (AST), most studies have                 Active school travel; policy-
     not investigated to what extent considering taste heterogeneity is                   sensitive variables; taste

     heterogeneity through mixed logit models – including random                          homogeneity or
     coe<U+FB03>cient and random coe<U+FB03>cient analysis (RCA) – materially                           heterogeneity
     improves/in<U+FB02>uences the AST prediction compared to a simpler
     model – the multinomial logit (MNL) model. The database
     comprises 735 valid observations. The results show that, with a
     10% increase in perceived walking time to school, the MNL model
     predicts that the AST share would decrease by 7.8% (from 18.9%
     to 17.4%) while the RCA model predicts that it would decrease by
     8.5% (from 18.9% to 17.3%). Thus, the expected share of AST is
     overestimated by MNL by one-tenth of a percentage point.
     Although there might be random taste variations around
     perceived distance to school, it seems the other important policy-
     sensitive variables, such as safety perception, homogeneously
     impacts on the AST share across households with di<U+FB00>erent
     socioeconomic and built environment characteristics. Our
     empirical assessment suggests that considering taste
     heterogeneity does not necessarily improve the accuracy of
     analysis for the aggregate share of the AST concerning policy-
     sensitive variables.
1. Introduction
Promoting pupils’ active travel (e.g. walking, cycling) to and from school promises numer-
ous societal bene<U+FB01>ts. For example, many studies have shown that the low share of active
school travel (AST) and physical activity might increase children’s health risk factors such
as obesity (Chung et al. 2012; Hedley et al. 2004), cardiovascular issues and bone health
problems (Boreham and Riddoch 2001; Larouche et al. 2014). Furthermore, AST could
improve children’s mental health and cognitive and psychological functioning (Biddle
and Asare 2011; Fyhri and Hjorthol 2009), and their independent mobility in the future
(Carver, Timperio, and Crawford 2013). Active transport modes might reduce

motorized-mode use (e.g. car use), tra<U+FB03>c congestion near schools and the subsequent
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2 (Wilson, Wilson, and Krizek 2007).
    Despite the importance, however, to explain and predict AST, most studies have
either relied on some types of analysis which do not re<U+FB02>ect unobserved taste heterogen-
eity of various factors at the individual level or have not investigated to what extent con-
sidering taste heterogeneity is an important element on the AST share. Several studies
have found simple logistic regression or multinomial logit models to be inadequate
and have instead used more complex forms such as nested or cross-nested logit. Yet
it is unlikely that the e<U+FB00>ect of a given variable would be <U+FB01>xed across decision makers
– i.e. the parents who choose their children’s travel mode to/from school. For
example, for some parents’ safety considerations may be paramount, whereas others
are less concerned about safety (since the walk is relatively safe) than about the fact
that the school is just too far away. For some, vehicle ownership may be important
because it could reduce mode choice <U+FB02>exibility, while for others it is unimportant
because it is not a constraint. A parent’s desire that the child have enough physical
activity may be more important to school mode choice when the child has little other
physical activity than when she is already playing soccer or taking dancing lessons
outside of school. These di<U+FB00>erent in<U+FB02>uences of various factors would re<U+FB02>ect unobserved
taste heterogeneity or random taste variation at the individual level (Kim and Mokhtar-
ian 2018). To date, although a few studies have incorporated taste heterogeneity on the
analysis of mode choice in school trips (Ulfarsson and Shankar 2008; Khan, Choudhury,
and Wang 2011; Noland et al. 2014; Forsey et al. 2013; Mehdizadeh, Nordfjaern, and
Mamdoohi 2018) we are not aware of any studies that investigated to what extent con-
sidering unobserved taste heterogeneity is an important element on the share of di<U+FB00>erent
travel modes such as the AST in school trips.
    In theory, by virtue of relaxing some restrictive assumptions (such as, in this case, that
‘one coe<U+FB03>cient <U+FB01>ts all’), a more complex model can more faithfully represent, and there-
fore predict, reality – certainly a desirable trait for informing public policy. On the other
hand, the fact that complexity is doubtless present in reality does not mean it is strong
enough to justify the greater elaborateness of the model – which entails some assumptions
of its own and contravenes the scienti<U+FB01>c goal of parsimony in explanation. With these
complementary perspectives in mind, the two related aims of the present study are: (1)
to identify any heterogeneity or random taste variation among decision makers, and
speculate on its possible source, and (2) to evaluate whether considering unobserved
taste heterogeneity through a more complex model materially improves/in<U+FB02>uences the
AST prediction compared to a simpler model.
    The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 reviews and discusses the
relevant literature. Section 3 represents the methodology including the modeling frame-
work and the data used in this study. Section 4 reports model speci<U+FB01>cation and results.
Section 5 provides an in-depth discussion over the results of sensitivity analysis. Section
6 concludes the study with summarizing the key <U+FB01>ndings.
2. Review and discussion of relevant literature
A number of di<U+FB00>erent variables have been found to in<U+FB02>uence AST and school travel mode
choice: socioeconomic and household factors (e.g. income, car ownership, parental job

                                            TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY       445
and educational status, household size), demographic variables (e.g. age, gender), built-
environmental variables (e.g. distance, accessibility, and land-use patterns), parental per-
ception about tra<U+FB03>c and AST facility safety, and some other psychological factors (e.g.
attitudes, worry) (see Mitra 2013 or Mehdizadeh, Mamdoohi, and Nordfjaern 2017a for
reviews of these factors).
   Among the variables identi<U+FB01>ed as important, distance (including travel time or physical
distance from home to school), some socio-economic factors (e.g. car ownership) and
safety perception were among the most policy sensitive. Some important strategies such
as safe route to school (SRTS), walking school bus (WSB), community schools and
optimal school siting are directly derived from these policy-sensitive variables. Travel
time (e.g. by walk or auto) or physical distance from home to school were the most sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant barriers in the school travel mode use studies. An increase in physical distance
or walk travel time could increase the probability of choosing motorized modes or
reduce the probability of AST use (e.g. see Sener, Lee, and Sidharthan 2018; Mehdizadeh,
Mamdoohi, and Nordfjaern 2017a; Mehdizadeh et al. 2017b; Ermagun and Samimi 2017;
Curtis, Babb, and Olaru 2015; Easton and Ferrari 2015; Ermagun and Levinson 2016,
2017; McDonald 2008; Mitra and Buliung 2015; Ermagun and Levinson 2016; Elias and
Katoshevski-Cavari 2014).
   Several studies have identi<U+FB01>ed a distance threshold for AST through descriptive statisti-
cal analysis. Schlossberg et al. (2005) showed that the 52% of pupils who live within a mile
of their schools have a higher probability of AST than the 48% of pupils who live farther
away. Two studies, in China (Li and Zhao 2015) and the Netherlands (Van Goeverden and
De Boer 2013), have shown that when home-to-school travel distance is longer than 3 km,
the share of AST will dramatically decline, while Timperio et al. (2006) reported that 800
meters might be a cut-o<U+FB00> for children’s AST in Australia. Curtis, Babb, and Olaru (2015),
applying a cluster analysis, found a <U+FB01>ve-to-10 minutes threshold for home-to-school walk
travel time.
   A number of other studies employed discrete choice modeling to evaluate the impact of
distance. Nelson et al. (2008) used a binomial logistic regression model and found that a 1-
mile increase in home-to-school distance reduced the odds of AST by around 71%.
McMillan (2007) estimated a binomial logit model and found that the odds of walking/
cycling to school are three times higher for pupils who live less than a mile away from
their schools than for others. McDonald (2008) estimated a multinomial logit (MNL)
model and found that a 10 percent increase in self-reported walk travel time reduces
pupils’ AST share by about 7.5%. Also using an MNL model, Ewing, Schroeer, and
Greene (2004) found that a 1% increase in walking time decreased the probability of
walking by around 0.67%. Ermagun and Samimi (2015) found the MNL model to be a
misspeci<U+FB01>cation, and they improved the formulation to the nested logit (NL). A 1%
increase in walking time decreases the probability of choosing AST by 2.44% and 2.37%
in the MNL and the NL model, respectively (Ermagun and Samimi 2015). Ermagun
and Levinson (2017) further advanced the mode choice model to a cross-nested logit
(CNL) formulation, using a similar database. They found that a 1% increase in walk
travel time to school decreases the probability of choosing walking by around 3.51%.
They pointed out that the simpler mathematical forms of previous analyses, including
the independence from irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property of MNL, might produce

446        M. MEHDIZADEH AND A. R. MAMDOOHI
inaccurate elasticities and other results, which could subsequently a<U+FB00>ect important policies
(Ermagun and Levinson 2017).
    Furthermore, a 1% increase in the child’s age, household income, or car ownership
reduced the share of AST by 0.82%, 0.26%, and 0.15%, respectively (McDonald 2008).
One percent increases in income, car ownership, and average sidewalk coverage decreased
the probability of AST by around 0.84%, and 1.16%, and increased it by 0.42%, respectively
(Ewing, Schroeer, and Greene 2004). On the other hand, 1% increases in parental edu-
cational background, car ownership, and income reduced the probability of AST by
0.36%, 0.08%, and 0.03% in a NL model, respectively (Ermagun and Samimi 2015). By
contrast, the direct elasticities of income and parental educational status with respect to
the probability of AST were -0.10% and -0.55% in a CNL model (Ermagun and Levinson
2017). Further, a 100% increase in parental worries about safety reduced the probability of
AST by 60% (Ermagun and Samimi 2015), and a one unit increase in the caregiver’s per-
ceived lack of safety in the neighborhood (measured on a 5-point scale) reduced the odds
of AST by around 13% (McMillan 2007).
    In most countries, school travel alternatives are household private cars, walking, public
transport, cycling, school service modes (e.g. school bus, carpooling) and other modes.
However, many previous studies have examined children’s mode choice in a binary situ-
ation (e.g. AST versus other modes; walking vs motorized modes) with binomial logit or
logistic regression model, and other statistical analysis. Although this manner simpli<U+FB01>es
model’s structure, the <U+FB01>nding has policy limitation for each alternative. Hence, several
studies tried to estimate multinomial logit (MNL) model to consider all alternatives.
    In MNL models, there are two assumptions (or restrictions): independently and iden-
tically distributed (IID) error terms in the utilities of each alternative, and the behaviorally
comparable assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) (Hensher, Rose,
and Greene 2005; Ortuzar and Willumsen 2011). Although these assumptions provide a
closed-form solution and ease the estimation of the model, they also have their violations
and errors. To partially relax the IID and IIA assumptions of the MNL model, the model
structure was advanced to NL. Although the NL model partially relaxes these assumptions
through variance components of the model together with some correlation within subsets
of alternatives, it also has a closed-form solution. For instance, Ermagun and Samimi
(2015) tried to estimate a three level NL model for school travel (12–17 years old)
mode choice (see also Lin and Chang 2010). They almost were the <U+FB01>rst that introduced
a slightly advanced model (NL model) to the literature of school travel mode choice.
Meanwhile, Ewing, Schroeer, and Greene (2004) further aimed to relax IIA property
(potential misspeci<U+FB01>cation issues in MNL model) with a NL model. But their results
showed that the MNL model has a decent structure. More recently, Ermagun and Levin-
son (2017) have developed a cross-nested logit (CNL) model to overcome some issues in
previous analyses, even the NL model. Moreover, some recent studies have recommended
accounting more realistic analysis to consider heterogeneity (Ermagun and Samimi 2015;
Ewing, Schroeer, and Greene 2004; Mehdizadeh, Nordfjaern, and Mamdoohi 2018).
    To summarize, in all mentioned methods including utility-based models (i.e. binary,
MNL, NL, CNL) and other statistical analysis, the e<U+FB00>ects of variables are considered
<U+FB01>xed across the population (parents or students). In other words, these analyses are not
able to identify any heterogeneity or random taste variation among observations. In
addition, although a few studies have accommodated taste heterogeneity on mode

choice decision in school trips (e.g. Noland et al. 2014; Forsey et al. 2013; Mehdizadeh,
Nordfjaern, and Mamdoohi 2018), no study has investigated how important is taste het-
erogeneity of various factors at the individual level on modal share in school trips,
especially on the AST share. Knowing such information could give new insights into plan-
ners’ viewpoints to make sure how policies associated with active school travel should be
implemented. The answer to such a research question can help policymakers to better
understand which segments of parents/households have a speci<U+FB01>c concern towards
their children’s active school travel.
3. Methodology
3.1. Model structures
The current research aims to estimate several more behaviorally realistic mode choice
models and compare them to each other and to simpler ones. In the following sub-sec-
tions, the MNL, MXL random coe<U+FB03>cient (RC), and random coe<U+FB03>cient analysis (RCA)
structures are explained. The NL structure and its speci<U+FB01>cation process is addressed in
the model speci<U+FB01>cation section (Section 4).
3.1.1. MNL model
In a discrete choice model such as MNL, an individual n is assumed to obtain some utility
from choosing an option i in his (or her) choice set. This utility is decomposed into an
observed, or systematic, portion (which is usually speci<U+FB01>ed to be linear in parameters)
and an unobserved, random portion:
                            Uni = b' Xni + 1ni    i = 1, 2, . . . , J,                   (1)
where the <U+FB01>rst term (b' Xni ) is the observed portion; Xni is a vector of observed variables
relating to individual n and alternative i, b' is a vector of coe<U+FB03>cients to be estimated
(which is constant across observations in the MNL model), and J is the number of avail-
able options. The 1ni is the error (or random) term, representing the e<U+FB00>ect of unobserved
variables on utility, and which, in the MNL model, is assumed to be IID extreme value. In
the MNL model, the probability of choosing alternative i for individual n is a closed form:
                                            exp (b' Xni )
                                    Pni =           '      .                            (2)
                                             j exp (b Xnj )
   The method of maximum likelihood is used to estimate the parameters of the MNL
model (Ortuzar and Willumsen 2011).
3.1.2. MXL random coe<U+FB03>cient (RC) model
MXL models relax the IID assumption by allowing the coe<U+FB03>cients to vary over decision-
makers in the population with a density of f (b) rather than being <U+FB01>xed as in MNL. In the
RC model the individual-speci<U+FB01>c b associated with the kth attribute is:
                                       bnk = bk + hnk ,                                  (3)
where hnk is a random term whose distribution over individuals depends in general on
underlying parameters, and can take on di<U+FB00>erent distributional forms such as normal,

448        M. MEHDIZADEH AND A. R. MAMDOOHI
lognormal, uniform, or triangular. hn denotes a vector of K random components in the set
of utility functions in addition to the J random elements in 1n . The unconditional prob-
ability of choosing alternative i for individual n is:
                                      
                                           exp (b' Xni )
                              Pni = (               '     )f (b|u)d b,                   (4)
                                            j exp (b Xnj )
    Where u is the vector of underlying parameters of the distributions of the b’s, for
instance the means and covariances of the b’s in the population.
3.1.3. MXL random coe<U+FB03>cient analysis (RCA) model (decomposition of
heterogeneity around the mean)
To reveal the absence or presence of preference heterogeneity around the mean coe<U+FB03>cient
of a given variable, we can interact each random coe<U+FB03>cient with other attributes or vari-
ables (by incorporating d'k zn into bnk ) that one supposes might be possible sources of pre-
ference heterogeneity (Hensher, Rose, and Greene 2005). In the RCA model bnk is:
                                     bnk = bk + hnk + d'k zn ,                            (5)
where Zn is a vector of observed variables speci<U+FB01>c to the individual, such as socio-econ-
omic and demographic characteristics. Hence, the probability function in the RCA
model is the same as that for the MXL model, the only di<U+FB00>erence being that bnk obeys
eq. (5) rather than eq. (3), and thus that for each random coe<U+FB03>cient there is an additional
vector d of parameters to estimate:
                                    
                                         exp (b' Xni )
                            Pni = (               '     )f (b|u, d)d b,                  (6)
                                          j exp (b Xnj )
    The integral is approximated via simulation (this process is repeated for many draws),
and the method of maximum simulated likelihood is used to estimate the parameters of
MXL models (Hensher, Rose, and Greene 2005; Train 2009).
3.2. Data
The study area consists of the city of Rasht, a rather large municipality in northern Iran
with a population of almost 64,000 in the 2011 census. The city has a radial urban
form with a rather dense built environment, residential areas and narrow roads. Car
use has dramatically increased in recent years. Therefore, high levels of tra<U+FB03>c congestion
are expected, particularly during peak hours. Public transport includes some urban buses
and taxis (carpooling). The number of urban buses and their time scheduling cannot ade-
quately support passengers in certain areas of the city. Hence, the study area has rather
weak public transport facilities compared to Western countries. There are no metro
systems, urban rail or other advanced transport systems as of January 2014.
    Active travel in the city is walking and bicycle use is very low among both the
general population and children. The city has a poor dedicated bicycling infrastruc-
ture. In addition, there are some safety and security concerns for females bicycling.
Hence, active school travel (AST) is associated with walking in this study and we
have ignored bicycling. The study area does not apply speci<U+FB01>c rules for public

                                            TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY       449
schools that are commonly found in Europe. In Rasht public schools are mostly
located in centers of communities, whereas private schools tend to be geographically
spread around the city. School locations therefore do not follow any speci<U+FB01>c pattern
or criteria in the study area. Some parents may choose a school that is allocated far
from their residence because the school may have a good educational program or
well-educated teachers. Private schools usually have a better educational quality com-
pared to public schools in Iran. Some schools may not have transport services. School
services (such as carpooling) have not been restricted to a speci<U+FB01>c distance. Pupils
who live in the same neighborhood usually use the same services to minimize dis-
tance and costs of travel. The number of services is dependent upon their demand.
Services usually pick up pupils about half an hour before the start of the <U+FB01>rst class
of the day. School services are also not free of charge in Iran. Of note, in the city
of Rasht, available modes for school trips are a variety of school service modes
(school bus or minibus or carpooling where school o<U+FB03>cials are responsible for mana-
ging both cars and chau<U+FB00>eurs), household private cars, walking, public transportation
(e.g. urban bus), and motorcycle.
   The present study uses a school trips database gathered in January 2014 by a cross-sec-
tional questionnaire survey among pupils (7-9 years old). Since this research has assumed
that parents make the <U+FB01>nal mode use decision for their children, the respondents were
parents. A combined random clustered and strati<U+FB01>ed sampling was the sampling
method deployed. The urban area of Rasht had two educational districts in 2014. The
two clusters of the sample were therefore based on these two educational districts. Nine
schools were randomly selected based on two criteria: pupil’s gender (schools are either
exclusively for girls or boys) and school type (public and private). All pupils in the ran-
domly selected classes (<U+FB01>rst to third grade classes) of these nine schools were given the
questionnaire to take home. A total of 1,078 questionnaires were distributed, where the
pupils were asked to take the questionnaires home for their parents to complete and
return two days later (return rate = 80 percent, n = 858). The school trip database
(based on these completed questionnaires) included several sections: household and
socio-economic characteristics, demographic factors, some built-environment factors,
parental perceptions about safety, and parental mode choice for their children.
   The explanatory variables are: pupils’ grade (7–9 years old), gender, household charac-
teristics (such as fathers and mothers driving license status, their educational background,
job status, household income level), household car ownership, parental physical activity in
a week, parental age and some built-environmental factors (including walking travel time
from home to school, accessibility to public transport along the home-to-school route),
parental worries about walking facility safety, and school service status. The dependent
variable is pupils’ mode use in school trips. Parental dominant mode choice was
assumed as children mode in school travel.
3.3. Data analysis
Descriptive statistical analysis of data from the questionnaires that had been adequately
completed (n = 735) show that nearly 56 percent of parents chose the school service,
nearly 22 percent chose the car, nearly 19% allowed children to walk, and the other
three percent chose other modes like public transport and motorcycle (see Figure 1).

Parents who allowed their children to use AST (i.e. walking) reported less perceived
walking time from home to school (as a measure of active travel distance) (Figure 2).
    The Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation coe<U+FB03>cients results showed (Table 1) that
pupils who traveled by household car, their parents reported higher car ownership.
They were also likely to have a higher income. Parents who permitted their children to
walk to school were more likely to perceive less walking time from home to school.
They also reported fewer owned cars. Parents who reported higher walking times were
more likely to have higher worries about AST safety. Parents who had reported more phys-
ical activity (e.g. the amount of exercise in a week) had less propensity to choose AST (i.e.
walking) for their children. Parents who had reported a higher educational background
were less likely to choose AST, and more likely to choose car travel. Mothers who had
a full-time job were more likely to use their car on school travel.

4. Model speci<U+FB01>cation and results
School service, private car and AST (i.e. walking) are considered as modes for school
travel. These three modes constitute a multinomial logit modeling (MNL) problem. Expla-
natory variables used in the models are shown in Table 2.
    To check some potential misspeci<U+FB01>cations related to the independence of irrelevant
alternatives (IIA) in the MNL model (Figure 3(a)), two nested logit (NL) models were
estimated (Figure 3(b and c)). The structure in (b) had an upper level nest with AST
(walking) and motorized modes, and the lower level nest with car and school service as
available choices, conditioned on a motorized modes choice occurring at the higher
level. The structure in (c) had an upper level nest with non-sustainable (car) and sus-
tainable modes, and the lower level nest with AST (walking) and school service as
available choices, conditional on a sustainable transport choice occurring at the
higher level. The results of the NL models showed that the inclusive value (IV) par-
ameters for all nested structures were not statistically equal to 1 but were statistically
greater than 1, which is theoretically impermissible and indirectly argues for the
MNL structure. Hence, the MNL was accepted as the base structure for estimating a
more complex model – a mixed logit (MXL) model. Then a random coe<U+FB03>cient (RC)
model (to explore heterogeneity) was estimated together with a random coe<U+FB03>cient
Figure 3. (a) MNL and (b and c) NL model structures.

analysis (RCA) model (to identify possible sources of heterogeneity). The three models
(i.e. MNL, RC and RCA) are reported in Table 3.
    Of note, in the RC model all coe<U+FB03>cients hypothesized to be random were tested with
respect to four prospective distributions (normal, lognormal, triangular and uniform).
Only coe<U+FB03>cients statistically signi<U+FB01>cant at the 10% level or better have been retained in
the models. All explanatory variables in the <U+FB01>nal models had the expected signs according
to the literature and common sense. Also, the signs of the coe<U+FB03>cients are the same across
all three models, with only slightly di<U+FB00>erent values.
    A likelihood ratio test with chi-squared statistics was applied to measure any signi<U+FB01>cant
improvement in the overall goodness of <U+FB01>t of the three models (Table 3). Results show that
the overall goodness of <U+FB01>t of both the RCA and RC models were higher than the MNL
model with 99 percent con<U+FB01>dence. In addition, the RCA overall goodness of <U+FB01>t was
higher than that of the RC model, at 99 percent con<U+FB01>dence. In addition, the observable
part of the utility function for modes in the three models are shown in Table 4.
    The results (Table 3) show that some socio-economic and household factors (i.e. car
ownership status, mother’s and father’s driving license status, mother’s educational back-
ground), some built-environmental characteristics (walk travel time and accessibility to
public transport in home to school path), school related factors (service situation and
public vs private schools), and parental worries about the safety of AST facilities were sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant variables in the models. Furthermore, consistent with Mitra and Buliung (2015)
and Mehdizadeh, Mamdoohi, and Nordfjaern (2017a), we did not <U+FB01>nd any signi<U+FB01>cant
relationship between children’s gender and mode use. Although income had a positive
and signi<U+FB01>cant relationship with car use in the correlation coe<U+FB03>cients analysis
(Table 1), it was not found to be statistically signi<U+FB01>cant in the models.
    Mothers who had a driving license and lower physical activity level were more likely to
choose a private car than other modes. Attending a public school may reduce the prob-
ability of choosing car travel. Accessibility to public transport, the higher education
degree of mothers, father’s driving license status and parental worries about safety had
negative e<U+FB00>ects on the probability of AST use. School service status had a positive e<U+FB00>ect
on the probability of service mode.
    There was heterogeneity in the estimated coe<U+FB03>cient over the sampled population
around the mean coe<U+FB03>cient estimate. There was found to be signi<U+FB01>cant heterogeneity
around the mean of perceived walking time to school (PWTS) in the AST and the
school service utilities and also car ownership (N_CAR) in car utility in the RC model.
This shows that di<U+FB00>erent parents possess parent-speci<U+FB01>c coe<U+FB03>cient estimates that may
be di<U+FB00>erent from the sample population mean coe<U+FB03>cient estimate. A likelihood ratio
test showed that among di<U+FB00>erent hypothesized distributions, the normal distribution
had a slightly better goodness of <U+FB01>t compared to other statistical distributions. Therefore,
a normal distribution was considered for the random coe<U+FB03>cients.
    The RCA model showed that some elements of heterogeneity around the mean of
random coe<U+FB03>cients may be the result of a dummy variable (CAR++ – household owned
more than one car = 1, otherwise=0). Households that own more than one car have a
greater sensitivity towards perception of walk travel time from home to school. A negative
sign (-0.35 for CAR++) for the random coe<U+FB03>cient (PWTS in walking utility) indicates that
this dummy variable (CAR++) will reduce the probability of choosing AST.

5. Sensitivity analysis and discussion
In terms of the behavioral implications of the models, such as the aggregate elasticities
(direct and cross) and marginal e<U+FB00>ects of the key policy-sensitive variables (Greene and
Hensher 2010), our evidence shows no distinguishable di<U+FB00>erences between the advanced
model and the simpler one. Aggregate elasticities and marginal e<U+FB00>ects (both direct and
cross) of the three models are shown in Table 5.
    Car ownership (N_CAR) has an aggregate direct elasticity of 1.10 in the RCA model.
Therefore, a one percent increase in household car ownership increases the share of choos-
ing the car by around 1.10%. Also, this variable has cross elasticities on the share of the
AST and the service mode by about -0.28%, and -0.34%, respectively, ceteris paribus.
Car ownership had a di<U+FB00>erent aggregate direct elasticity of 0.70% and cross elasticities
of -0.20% for the AST and the service mode in the MNL model (see Figure 4(a) for
more detail). With a 10% increase in car ownership the MNL model would estimate
that the AST share would decrease by 2% (from 18.9% to 18.52%) while the RCA
model estimates that it decreases by 2.8% (from 18.9% to 18.37%). Thus, the expected
share of AST is underestimated in the MNL model by 0.15 of a percentage point.
Several studies have reported the negative e<U+FB00>ect of car ownership on the share of AST
use (cf. McDonald 2008). For example, Ermagun and Samimi (2015) showed that with
a 10% increase in car ownership the MNL model would estimate that the AST probability
would decrease by 1.30% while the NL model would estimate that it decreases by 0.80%.
    The aggregate direct elasticity of choosing AST, with respect to the perceived walking
time to school (PWTS), is -0.78% in the MNL model, -0.84% in the RC model, and
-0.85% in the RCA model, while this variable has cross elasticities on the service in the
MNL, RC and RCA models of about 0.17%, 0.21%, and 0.21%, respectively. PWTS had
cross elasticities on the share of car by around 0.22%, 0.17%, and 0.19% in the MNL,
RC, and RCA models, respectively (see also Figure 4(b)). With a 10% increase of the
PWTS the MNL model would estimate that the AST share would decrease by 7.8%
(from 18.9% to 17.4%) while the RCA model would estimate that it decreases by 8.5%
(from 18.9% to 17.3%). Thus, the expected share of AST is overestimated by MNL by
one-tenth of a percentage point. Distance (e.g. physical and travel time) was the most
reported barrier and policy-sensitive variable for children’s active school travel. A 1%
increase in distance reduced the probability of AST by 2.44% in the MNL model and
2.37% in a NL model (Ermagun and Samimi 2015).
    A 1% increase in mother’s educational degree decreases the share of choosing the AST
mode by 0.56% in the MNL model, 0.56% in the RC model, and 0.45% in the RCA model
(see also Figure 4(c)). Hence, with a 10% increase in the mother’s educational degree, the
MNL model would estimate that the share of AST would decrease by 5.6% (from 18.9% to
17.84%) while the RCA model would estimate that it decreases by 4.5% (from 18.9% to
18.05%). Thus, the expected share of AST is underestimated by the MNL by one-<U+FB01>fth
of a percentage point. Of note, some previous studies have found that mothers with
high educational degrees had less tendency to choose AST (e.g. walking, cycling) for
their children (cf. McMillan 2007). For instance, a 1 percent increase in parental edu-
cational background reduced the probability of AST by around 0.36% in both MNL
and NL models (Ermagun and Samimi 2015) for students’ (12-17 years old) AST.

    The aggregate share of choosing AST, with respect to perceptions of safety, is 0.53%,
0.38%, and 0.41% in the MNL, RC and RCA models, respectively (see also Figure 4(d)).
With a 1% increase in safety perception, the estimated <U+FB01>nal share of the AST would be
18.8% (99.47% × 18.9%) in the MNL model, versus 18.82% (99.59% × 18.9%) in the
RCA model-essentially indistinguishable. Although this variable is ordinal, it is treated
as continuous in the model and can be viewed as representing an underlying continuous
safety perception, and thus from that perspective it is appropriate to consider the impact of
continuous changes in safety perception.
6. Conclusions
Many studies have shown that the low share of active school travel (AST) and physical
activity might increase children’s health risks. As a result, a large body of previous

                                              TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY      459
studies and projects have recommended a variety of strategies and programs to alleviate
the negative e<U+FB00>ects of policy-sensitive barriers such as home-to-school distance and
AST safety problems. However, these studies have neither considered taste heterogeneity
at the individual level nor investigated the importance of accommodating unobserved taste
heterogeneity. The main aim of the study reported here was to evaluate whether consider-
ing taste heterogeneity through advanced models materially in<U+FB02>uences and/or improves
the share of AST compared to a simpler model.
    Although our empirical evidence has shown that more complex models (here random
coe<U+FB03>cient analysis (RCA)) have slightly higher goodness of <U+FB01>ts than a multinomial logit
(MNL) model, from a behavioral implications perspective (Greene and Hensher 2010), the
main policy-sensitive variables had essentially indistinguishable aggregate elasticities in
the complex and simpler discrete choice models on the share of AST. The empirical assess-
ment showed that a more complex model may not be of such great empirical consequence
in respect of behavioral outputs such as elasticities for policy-sensitive variables. Using a
more complex model therefore needs a more considered justi<U+FB01>cation. Based on empirical
data obtained for the city of Rasht, the di<U+FB00>erence between the estimated shares of AST for
both the MNL and RCA models was not substantial. With a 1% increase in the perceived
walking time to school, the <U+FB01>nal share of AST was estimated to be 18.75% in the MNL
model and 18.74% in the RCA model, a result that is essentially indistinguishable. In
addition, with a 1% increase in safety perception, the <U+FB01>nal share of AST was estimated
to be 18.8% in the MNL model and 18.82% in the RCA model, a result that is again essen-
tially indistinguishable.
    Although random taste variation might be found around the perceived distance to
school, it seems the other important policy-sensitive variable, safety perception, has a
homogeneous impact on the AST share across households with di<U+FB00>erent socioeconomic
and built environment characteristics. This implies, for example, that planners could
meet the safety requirements for all households/neighborhoods in the city in the same
way. This may highlight the fact that, regardless of schoolchildren’s/households’ and
neighborhood characteristics, di<U+FB00>erent parents have a similar concern toward
their children’s active school travel throughout all regions of the study area, which we
speculate is due to the lack of integrated and safe pedestrian infrastructures in the city
of Rasht.
    In general, it is hard to answer the question that considering taste heterogeneity can
in<U+FB02>uence the accuracy of sensitivity analysis. It depends on several things: the aim of
the study, the type of database, the ‘white noise’ issue and/or specifying the remaining
unobserved portion of utility functions (Train 2009; Cherchi and de Dios Ortúzar 2008,
2011; Greene and Hensher 2010). Our evidence suggests that the MNL model can be
the goal, if by including interaction terms in an MNL model we obtain a speci<U+FB01>cation
that does not violate the IIA property (Mokhtarian 2016), then considering taste hetero-
geneity is not an important element and such a sophisticated model is probably not
needed. As a result, when the unobserved portion of utility functions in discrete choice
models is ‘white noise’, an MNL model is, as Train (2009) puts it, the ideal rather than
a restriction. For instance, it has been found that some part of taste variation in the per-
ception of walk travel time to school might be a result of household’s car ownership status.
This may show that the random coe<U+FB03>cient analysis (RCA) points to the best variables to
interact in an ordinary MNL model.
