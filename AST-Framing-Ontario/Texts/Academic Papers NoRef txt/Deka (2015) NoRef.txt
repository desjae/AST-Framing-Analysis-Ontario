The study examines historical changes in size and location of schools in New Jersey and their relevance to children’s walking and
bicycling to school. It compares the characteristics of schools, students, and surrounding areas of schools established in different
decades to identify the critical issues that affect active transportation to school in the state. The study shows that schools in the state
have become larger and they are increasingly being located on state and county roads instead of local roads. Pedestrian safety for
children seems to be a greater concern in the state than distance to school.
Keywords: active transportation, bicycling, school location, school siting, school transportation, walking
