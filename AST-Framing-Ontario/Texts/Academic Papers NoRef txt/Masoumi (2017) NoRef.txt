  Abstract: Increasing rates of body weight of children has become a motivation for
  investigating active transportation to school during the past years. Lack of proper data
  covering different geographical contexts is a problem seen in the literature of this subject. The
  present paper reports the findings of a recent survey on nine cities in seven European
  countries funded by the European Commission. The objective of the survey was to provide
  data covering several topics in relation with active commuting to school and body mass index,
  such as parental perceptions of safety and security, neighborhood facilities, land use
  characteristics, etc. in different regions of Europe in a way that cross-sectional comparisons
  between regions and city sizes is facilitated. For that, 2735 children/parents were handed out
  questionnaires, from whom 1424 filled out the questionnaires (response rate: 52%). This led
  to 1304 validated questionnaires. The respondents studied in 21 elementary schools of Foggia,
  Italy; Berlin, Germany; Thessaloniki, Greece; Rijeka, Croatia; Utrecht, The Netherlands; Lódz,
  Poland; Konstantynow, Poland; Malatya, Turkey, and Dogansehir, Turkey as of March 2016
  until January 2017. The survey instrument enables development of continuous and categorical
  variables for empirical research with strong focus on the built environment using the aggregate
  data provided by this study. It is expected that the output data eases production of knowledge
  about less-studied European contexts as well as cross-sectional comparison of results with
  more studied areas of Western Europe.
  Key words: Active transport to school, children’s body weight, urban form, perceived built
  environment
  Highlights for public administration, management and planning:
   • The survey is done on nine cities in seven European countries located in different regions.
   • 2735 questionnaires were handed out, 1424 of which were filled out; 1304 were validated,
       providing response rate of 52.07%.
   • The preliminary and descriptive analysis of data shows cultural and geographical
       differences in mobility patterns of children, the perceptions, and the body weights.
