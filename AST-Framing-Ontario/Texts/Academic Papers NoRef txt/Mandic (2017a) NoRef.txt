1. Introduction
    Public health goals of increased physical activity and societal interest in alternatives to automobile transportation place a
focus on active modes of transport such as walking and cycling. In addition, the need to transition away from motorised
transport, particularly the private car, has been publicized as an important way to reduce transport-related greenhouse gas
emissions (Sims et al., 2014). Transport mode choice is one of the most environmentally-significant decisions made by
individuals (Collins and Chambers, 2005), and addressing high-carbon personal transport represents a key opportunity to
mitigate climate change.
    Though walking is a popular form of active transport to school, cycling to school is less common among adolescents in
many developed countries including United States (McDonald, 2007), Canada (Larsen et al., 2009), Spain (Chillon et al.,
2009), Ireland (Murtagh et al., 2016), Australia (Leslie et al., 2010) and New Zealand (Mandic et al., 2015). In contrast,
countries with long cycling traditions, comprehensive cycling-friendly infrastructure and flat landscape such as Belgium
(Van Dyck et al., 2010) and Denmark (Cooper et al., 2006) have higher rates of cycling versus walking to school among
adolescents. In New Zealand, rates of walking to school in adolescents have remained relatively stable (26% in 1989/1990;
28% in 2010–2014) while the rates of cycling to secondary school have declined from 19% in 1989/1990 to 3% in 2010–2014
(Ministry of Transport, 2015).
    Correlates of active transport to school in children and adolescents include demographic characteristics, individual and
family factors, school factors, and social and physical environmental factors (Davison et al., 2008; Panter et al., 2008; Pont
et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2011) Most previous studies either examined perceived barriers to walking and cycling to school
together or focused on walking (Lu et al., 2014). Walking and cycling are different behaviours with distinct characteristics
(Krizek et al., 2009) and therefore correlates of those behaviours are also likely to differ (Lu et al., 2014; Schlossberg et al.,
2006). Compared to walking, cycling is faster, covers greater distances, requires more physical skills, demands more specific
built environment characteristics, and has more prominent traffic safety concerns (Krizek et al., 2009). In addition, built
environment characteristics that predict walking to school in children may not predict cycling (Schlossberg et al., 2006). For
children, cycling to school is positively associated with high levels of independent mobility (Ducheyne et al., 2012), pre-
ference to cycle (Trapp et al., 2011), parental confidence in their child's cycling skills (Ducheyne et al., 2012; Trapp et al.,
2011), peer and parental support (Ducheyne et al., 2012), and neighbourhood traffic safety (Ducheyne et al., 2012), and
negatively associated with perceived convenience of driving children to school (Trapp et al., 2011).
    Low rates of cycling to school reported in New Zealand adolescents (Mandic et al., 2015; Ministry of Transport, 2015) may
be context-specific and related to the local cycling culture, social norms, non-supportive physical environments and the
weather. The city of Dunedin (population: 130,000) is located on the South Island of New Zealand, has a maritime climate
with cool and wet weather and diverse topographical landscape with the city centre being surrounded by hills. Coupled
with New Zealand's high rates of bicycle-related accidents in adolescents (Tin et al., 2010), nation-wide high rates of private
vehicle ownership per capita (The World Bank, 2014), school uniform requirements and lack of school enrolment schemes in
Dunedin, these characteristics represent a challenge for promoting active transport to school, and particularly cycling, in this
city. Previous studies in adolescents highlighted the importance of social support for active transport (Leslie et al., 2010;
Carver et al., 2010) and specifically for cycling (Ducheyne et al., 2012) to school, with a distance of up to 4 km (2.5 miles)
being reasonable for adolescents’ cycling to school (Nelson et al., 2008). Therefore, this cross-sectional study compared
perceptions of walking versus cycling to school drawing from the theory of planned behaviour and additional individual,
environmental and safety factors among adolescents from Dunedin who lived within 4 km from school.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Participants
    Between February 2014 and April 2015, 1780 adolescents (13 to 18 years of age) from all 12 secondary schools in Du-
nedin, New Zealand, participated in the Built Environment and Active Transport to School (BEATS) Study (Mandic et al.,
2015; Mandic et al., 2016). Participants with invalid surveys (n ¼38), incomplete student consents (n¼ 20), lacking parental
consent (n¼59), missing survey data (n ¼48), boarders (n¼162), missing distance to school data (n¼11), and living 44 km
from school (n¼668) were excluded from the analysis, resulting in a final usable sample size of 774 adolescents.
2.2. Procedures
    Recruitment procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (Mandic et al., 2016). Briefly, adolescents were recruited
through schools and completed the online survey during class time under researcher assistants’ supervision. All adolescents
signed consent for taking part in the study. For those under 16 years of age, parents signed either parental opt-out or
parental opt-in consent based on the school's preference. The study was approved by the University of Otago Ethics
Committee.

2.3. Assessments
2.3.1. Questionnaire
    The survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, school, home address,
home resources) travel to school habits, perceptions of walking and cycling to school and enablers of cycling to school.
Response validity was strengthened by the fact that research assistants were present as participants completed the survey
and were monitoring the manner in which participants responded. As a result, 38 invalid surveys were removed from the
final sample.
2.3.2. Sociodemographic characteristics
    Age was calculated from date of birth at the time of the survey. Home address data were used to determine New Zealand
Index of Deprivation (a neighbourhood area deprivation score) as a surrogate for students’ socioeconomic status (Salmond
et al., 2006). The deprivation index was recoded from the original 10-point scale (1 ¼least deprived to 10 ¼most deprived)
into five categories: lowest (1–2), middle-low (3–4), middle (5–6), middle-high (7–8) and highest (9–10) deprivation score.
Adolescents also reported the number of bicycles and vehicles at home and whether they had a waterproof raincoat. Dis-
tance from home to school was determined using the Geographic Information Systems network analysis, based on geocoded
addresses (Mandic et al., 2016).
2.3.3. Travel to school habits
    Transport to school (“How do you usually travel to school?”) was assessed for different transport modes with response
categories “never”, “rarely”, “sometimes”, “most of the time” and “all of the time”. Dominant modes of transport to school (used
“most/all of the time”) and multi-modal transport were used to classify adolescents into active transport (walking, cycling,
or riding a non-motorised scooter “most/all of the time”), motorised transport or combined motorised and active transport.
Adolescents were also asked how often they walked and cycled to school in the previous two weeks (“never”, “almost
never”, “sometimes”, “almost every day” or “every day”) and to estimate how long would their journey to school take if they
walked or cycled to school (“1–5 min”, “6–10 min”, 11–20 min”, “21–30 min”, “31þ min” or “I don’t know”).
2.3.4. Beliefs about walking and cycling to school
    Beliefs related to perceptions of walking and cycling to school were informed by the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen,
1991). Specifically, questions about attitudes towards walking and cycling, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control (PBC)
and behavioural intentions were measured with standard items and had good internal reliability (Armitage, 2005). Additional
items were developed specifically for this study. Survey items have been described in detail elsewhere (Mandic et al., 2016).
    Briefly, items assessing attitudes towards walking and cycling to school used the stem “For me, regularly walking to
school / riding to school by bicycle would be…” rated on a six bipolar (-3 to þ3) semantic differential scales, anchored by
the adjectives “dull”-“interesting”, “unpleasant”-“pleasant”, “boring”-“stimulating” for experiential beliefs and “unhealthy”-
“healthy”, “bad”-“good” and “useless”-“useful” for instrumental beliefs (Armitage, 2005). Given the conceptual similarities,
individual items for experiential and instrumental beliefs were summed and then averaged to create two composite scores
(experiential beliefs composite score: Cronbach's a ¼0.87 (walking), 0.95 (cycling); instrumental beliefs composite score:
Cronbach's a ¼0.82 (walking), 0.84 (cycling)).
    Subjective norm was assessed using the items “My parents/guardians think I… should/should not walk/ride a bicycle to
school”, “My friends think I… should/should not walk/ride a bicycle to school” and “One or both of my parents/guardians
walk/bicycle frequently” (Mandic et al., 2016). Adolescents also reported frequency of walking/cycling with parents and
peers and schools’ encouragement for walking/cycling to school (Mandic et al., 2016).
    The capability component of PBC for walking and cycling was measured using an item “How confident are you that you
could walk/cycle to school?” (not very confident-very confident) (Armitage, 2005). Two additional items were used to assess
capability for cycling: “To what extent do you see yourself as being capable of riding a bicycle to school? (incapable-cap-
able)”; and “I believe that I have the ability to ride a bicycle to school” (definitely do not-definitely do) (Armitage, 2005). Given
the conceptual similarities, the scores for ability/capability/confidence items for cycling to school were summed and then
averaged to create a cycling capability composite score (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.90).
    The autonomy component of PBC to walk/cycle to school was measured using an item “How much personal control do
you yourself have over whether or not you walk/ride a bicycle to school?” (no control-complete control).
    Behavioural intentions were measured using two items: “How often do you intend to walk/ride a bicycle to school?
(never-frequently), and “I want to regularly walk/ride a bicycle to school (definitely do not-definitely do) (Armitage, 2005).
2.3.5. Incentives and personal barriers for walking and cycling to school
    Incentives (getting exercise, opportunity to socialize) and personal barriers (time constraints, need for planning, after-
school schedule, too much to carry, sweating, feeling tired and lack of interest/desire to walk/cycle to school) were assessed
using separate items for each mode of transport to school using a 4-point Likert scale anchored in “strongly disagree”
(1) and “strongly agree” (4). Personal barriers were also combined into a composite score (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.85, and 0.84 for
walking and cycling, respectively; all corrected item-total correlations greater or equal than 0.53).

                                        S. Mandic et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 4 (2017) 294–304                            297
2.3.6. Environmental barriers and safety
    Environmental barriers (distance, lack of footpaths/bike lanes, and weather) and safety perceptions (adolescents’ and
parental perceptions) related to walking and cycling to school were assessed using separate items for each mode of
transport to school. All items were assessed using a 4-point Likert scale anchored in “strongly disagree” (1) and “strongly
agree” (4).
2.3.7. Route to school
    Route to school (hills, insufficient lighting, too much traffic, dangerous crossing(s), boring route) and convenience of
being driven to school were assessed for walking and cycling together using a 4-point Likert scale with response options
ranging from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (4).
2.3.8. Enablers of cycling to school
    Factors that would encourage cycling to school were examined using a statement “I would cycle to school more often if…”
focusing on speed of traffic (“if the traffic on the road(s) was slower”), availability of bus bike racks (“if buses had bike racks free
of charge”), safer bike storage at school (“if there were safer places to lock up my bike at school”), lockers for storing belongings
at school (“if I had a locker at school for storing my things”), cycle friendly uniform (“if I had a cycle-friendly uniform”), cycling
without a helmet (“if I was allowed to cycle without a helmet”) and bike ownership (“if I owned a bike”). These items were
assessed using a 4-point Likert scale anchored in “strongly disagree” (1) and “strongly agree” (4).
2.4. Data analysis
    Variables assessing perceptions of walking versus cycling using 4-point or 7-point Likert scales were analysed as con-
tinuous variables using paired t-tests. For those items, data are reported as both mean 7SD and frequency (%) of adolescents
agreeing with each statement. To calculate the proportion of adolescents agreeing with each statement, 4-point Likert scale
items were also recoded into “disagree” and “agree” and 7-point Likert scale items were recoded as “disagree”, “neutral” or
“agree”. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistical Package (Version 22). To account for multiple tests, a p-value of
o0.001 was chosen to indicate statistical significance.
3. Results
3.1. Sociodemographic characteristics
    Among 764 adolescents surveyed (age: 15.2 71.4 years; 44.6% males), 71.8% had at least one bicycle available for their
use and 61.0% had two or more vehicles at home (Table 1). Average distance to school was 1.971.0 km (Table 1). Adoles-
cents’ estimates revealed that 51.7% could walk and 58.8% could cycle to school within 20 min and 29.3% did not know the
estimated time to cycle to school (Table 2).
3.2. Transport to school habits
    Common modes of transport to school were being driven in a car and walking, whereas only 2.1% cycled to school
(Table 1). Overall, 44.0% of adolescents used active transport, 42.4% motorised transport and 13.6% combined motorised and
active transport. The rates of active transport to school did not differ by gender (males: 45.0%, females: 43.1%; p¼ 0.050), age
(42.5%, 41.8%, 53.1%, 42.1%, 40.4%, 38.5% for age 13 to 18 years, respectively; p¼.129), ethnicity (New Zealand European:
43.6%, Maori: 45.1%, other: 44.9%; p¼.142) or socioeconomic status (41.3%, 43.2%, 42.1%, 49.7% and 45.7% for quintiles of
neighbourhood deprivation scores from quintile 1 (least deprived) to quintile 5 (most deprived), respectively; p¼ .389). In
the previous two weeks, 48.7% of adolescents walked and 1.9% cycled to school on most days (Table 2). The rates of active
transport to school ranged from 19.2% to 59.1% per school (Fig. 1).
3.3. Route to school
    Approximately one third of adolescents reported too much traffic (36.0%), dangerous crossing(s) (32.9%), too many hills
(33.4%) and boring route (33.0%) for walking or cycling to school. Poor lighting (12.2%) and stray dogs (6.9%) were less
common. More than half of adolescents (52.9%) found being driven to school convenient.
3.4. Attitudes, social norm, perceived behavioural control and behavioural intentions
    On average, adolescents had more positive experiential and instrumental beliefs towards walking compared to cycling to
school (Table 3). One third of adolescents perceived that cycling to school was not cool (Table 3). Adolescents received
significantly less parental, peer and school support and less parental role modelling for cycling versus walking to
school (Table 3). In addition, 16.3% and 21.0% of adolescents often cycled with friends or parents, respectively. Intention and

self-perceived confidence was lower for cycling compared to walking to school (Table 3). Using a composite score for cycling
capability, 58.8% of adolescents had high, 10.7% average and 30.5% low self-perceived capability to cycle to school.
3.5. Incentives and personal barriers
    Compared to walking, cycling to school provided less opportunity for socializing with friends (Table 4). Although cycling
would be faster than walking, cycling to school had more personal barriers (such as too much to carry, after-school schedule,
need for planning and getting sweaty) (Table 4). Half of adolescents felt too tired or could not be bothered to walk or cycle to
school (Table 4).
3.6. Environmental barriers and safety perceptions
    One quarter of adolescents living within 4 km from school perceived that it was too far to walk or cycle to school
(Table 4) with perceived distance being a greater barrier for walking versus cycling. Routes to school had less bike lanes
compared to walking paths (Table 4). Adolescents reported that both they and their parents considered cycling to school less
safe than walking. Wet and cold weather was a major barrier for both modes of transport.

4. Discussion
    Key findings of the present study include: 1) although half of adolescents enjoyed cycling for recreation, few cycled to
school; 2) compared to walking, cycling to school among Dunedin adolescents was less common and a less preferred mode
of transport, had more personal barriers, received less social and infrastructure support and was perceived as less safe; 3)
approximately one third of adolescents living within 4 km from school perceived themselves as incapable of cycling to
school; 4) revisiting school uniform policy, availability of bike racks on the school grounds, reducing traffic speed and
availability of a low-cost bike library may increase the rates of cycling to school in adolescents. These findings suggest that
social norms and local cycling culture in Dunedin may in part explain the lower preference for cycling versus walking to
school in adolescents. Future active transport initiatives should be context-specific and consider the local cycling culture and
environment as well as different incentives and personal barriers for cycling versus walking to school.
    Though nearly half of adolescents living r4 km from school walked to school, cycling to school was less common, less
preferred and less desirable mode of transport to school among adolescents in the present study. Lower rates of cycling

versus walking to school have been observed among adolescents in many developed countries (McDonald, 2007; Larsen
et al., 2009; Chillon et al., 2009; Murtagh et al., 2016; Leslie et al., 2010; Mandic et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2008) with a steep
decline in cycling to school reported among New Zealand adolescents in the last three decades (Ministry of Transport, 2015).
In contrast, countries with strong cycling traditions, extensive cycling-friendly infrastructure and flat landscape, consistently
report higher rates of cycling versus walking to school (e.g., Denmark (Cooper et al., 2006) and Belgium (Van Dyck et al.,
2010)).
    The local cycling culture in Dunedin (New Zealand) may in part explain the lower preference for cycling versus walking
to school among adolescents. In the present study, half of adolescents enjoyed cycling for recreation but less than one fifth
often cycled with friends or parents and less than a quarter received encouragement from parents, peers and school to cycle
to school. In addition, one third of adolescents perceived that cycling to school was not ‘cool’. Previous studies highlighted
the importance of social support for active transport (Leslie et al., 2010; Carver et al., 2010; Simons et al., 2013; Verhoeven
et al., 2016) and specifically for cycling to school in adolescents (Ducheyne et al., 2012).
    Parental perceptions of personal safety and the dangers posed by traffic (speed and volume) and dangerous intersections
have been identified as key parental barriers to walking and cycling to school (Broberg and Sarjala, 2015), especially in
adolescent girls (Esteban-Cornejo et al., 2016; Carver et al., 2005). In the present study, road safety concerns (too much
traffic and/or dangerous crossing[s]) on the way to school were reported by one third of adolescents and reducing traffic
speed was seen as a favourable strategy for promoting cycling to school. Adolescents also reported that cycling to school was
perceived as less safe by themselves and their parents compared to walking. Focus groups with students and parents
conducted as a part of the BEATS Study identified a complex range of factors that contribute to perceptions of cycling safety,
including features and perceptions of the built environment, traffic safety (including behaviours of other road users),
previous cycling experiences (including accidents) and adolescents’ cycling skills and on-road experiences (Hopkins and
Mandic, 2016). Taken together, these findings suggest that low perceived social support for cycling to school among Dunedin
adolescents may be in part mediated by adolescents’ and parental road safety concerns.
    Safety concerns including poor walking and cycling facilities, traffic danger and personal safety concerns decrease the
likelihood of active transport to school in children and adolescents (Trapp et al., 2011; Kerr et al., 2006). Specific to cycling,
parental confidence in their child's ability to cycle to school mediates the association between the perceived safety and
cycling in children (Trapp et al., 2011). In the present study, adolescents reported that they and their parents perceived
cycling to school as less safe compared to walking. In addition, one third of adolescents living o4 km from school did not
perceive themselves as capable to cycle to school. These findings emphasise the need for not only creating safer environ-
ments but also offering programmes such as cycle skills training (Mandic et al., 2016) to improve adolescents' cycle skills.
    Other barriers to active transport to school such as the weather (Gustat et al., 2015; Aibar et al., 2015), hills (Timperio
et al., 2006), high rates of private vehicle ownership (Mandic et al., 2015; McDonald, 2008) and convenience of being driven
(e.g. trip chaining) (Schlossberg et al., 2006; Gustat et al., 2015) may in part explain the low preference for cycling versus
walking to school among Dunedin adolescents. Although half of adolescents in the present study reported cold and wet
weather as a barrier to active transport, the weather was not a greater barrier for cycling versus walking to school. One third
of surveyed adolescents reported too many hills on the way to school and one-half reported convenience of being driven to
school by someone on the way to something else. Considering greater personal barriers to cycling versus walking to school
observed in the present study (too much to carry, after-school schedule, need for planning and sweating), future studies
should examine if perceived convenience of being driven to school has a greater impact on cycling versus walking to school
in adolescents.
    School's support for active transport plays an important role in promoting active transport to school (Gustat et al., 2015;
Buliung et al., 2011) through activities such as safety education, special events and infrastructure improvements (Buliung
et al., 2011). Our findings suggest that cycling-specific interventions at the school level should address school uniform policy
(e.g., allow students to cycle to school without a school uniform) as well as school grounds infrastructure to provide safe
bicycle storage facilities and lockers at school.
    In the present study, owning a bicycle and having bus bike racks available free of charge were perceived as enablers of
cycling to school by one third and one quarter of adolescents, respectively. Therefore, community-based or city-wide in-
terventions such as availability of the low-cost bike library or bus bike racks free of charge may be effective in promoting
cycling to school in adolescents. A law requiring the wearing of a bike helmet was a barrier to cycling to school in only one in
five adolescents. Other previously suggested interventions (Gustat et al., 2015; Larouche et al., 2013) should be considered
for promoting cycling to school such as a minimum busing distance laws, developing a well-connected network of cycle
lanes along low traffic streets and encouraging both adolescents and their parents to reconsider what constitutes a rea-
sonable cycling distance.
4.1. Limitations
    This study has limitations that should be recognized. First, the cross-sectional design prevents claims about causality.
Second, the unique setting of Dunedin may limit generalizability of findings to other cities and countries with different
topography, built environment features and cycling culture. Finally, travel patterns from school to home and objective
measures of the environment were not available. Despite the limitations, the strengths include a comprehensive survey of
factors affecting walking and cycling behaviour in adolescents and a large representative sample of adolescents from one
