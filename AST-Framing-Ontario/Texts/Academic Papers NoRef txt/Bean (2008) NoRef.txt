  Exploring Social Mobilities: Narratives
 of Walking and Driving in Auckland,

    Abstract
    Recent studies have discussed the important role of the automobile in shaping
    contemporary urban social life. This research used a series of focus groups in Auckland,
    New Zealand, to illuminate the complex social attitudes and values associated with
    walking as well as driving. While the car is the dominant transport mode in Auckland,
    the shortcomings as well as the benefits of automobile use and dependence are well
    known. Moreover, while walking is often difficult in this urban environment, it
    continues to be perceived as a potentially useful and appropriate means of transport,
    and as an important and valued social practice. The paper's findings suggest that the
    positive perceptions of walking, as a facilitator of health and social life, could be built
    upon by policy-makers to encourage a greater use of this active form of travel.
