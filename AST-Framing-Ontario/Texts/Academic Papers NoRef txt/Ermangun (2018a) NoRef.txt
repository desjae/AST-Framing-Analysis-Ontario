Abstract We test a copula-based joint discrete–continuous model to unravel mode choice
and travel distance decisions in a joint framework for school trips. This framework
explicitly accounts for common unobserved factors that may affect both the mode choice
and travel distance. Joint estimation of the models makes a significant difference in the
effect of travel distance on willingness to walk to school. The absolute value of the travel
distance coefficient in the mode choice model increases by 22% when a joint formulation is
adopted instead of the conventional single estimations. We find a significant decrease of
19% in the coefficient of travel safety perception in the joint mode choice model compared
to the single model. This underscores the impact of model specification, in terms of the
variable effect interpretation and policy assessments. The effect magnitude of several
policy-sensitive variables is discussed and compared with previous studies. Particularly,
we indicate that the probability of walking is reduced by 0.85% due to a 1% increase in
travel distance; accordingly, it propels parents to select non-active modes, particularly
school bus. This study also demonstrates how addressing parental concerns about travel
safety could double the propensity to walk to school.

Introduction
Developed and developing countries have witnessed an increase in the use of private cars
in school trips, which has resulted in a diminution in the share of active transportation
modes (such as walking and biking). According to the Department for Transport in Great
Britain, 55% of all secondary school children walked to school in 1976, while this share
dropped to 38% by 2012 (Easton and Ferrari 2015). Surveys conducted in Australia also
revealed that the share of children’s active and independent travelling to school declined
from 61% to 32% between 1991 and 2012 (Schoeppe et al. 2015). Such behavioral shifts
have adverse consequences that include: physical inactivity among students (Cooper et al.
2005), increasing costs of obesity (Sepulveda et al. 2010), traffic jams at peak hours
(Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center 2008), and adverse environmental impacts
(Wilson et al. 2007). Hence, detecting factors that affect this change is crucial for con-
trolling this trend and promoting active modes of travel.
    Among the effective factors, travel distance is found to be very influential, if not the
most influential, on the choice of school travel mode (Seraj et al. 2012). All the previous
studies found a negative correlation between home-to-school distance and students’
propensity to walk to school (Ermagun and Levinson 2017). Therefore, two major research
venues, namely school travel mode and home-to-school distance, have been developed to
find effective policies that may encourage active modes among children. There are two
dominant viewpoints in modeling travel distance and travel mode. First, both decisions are
considered to be made jointly by the parents. This school of thought acknowledges when
parents are deciding on which school to register their children in, they also consider
different travel options for them. For example, parents who are more worried about the
safety of their children may choose a school that either has a safe walkway to home or is
easily accessible by their private car. Therefore, this point of view strongly supports a joint
formulation for travel distance and mode. Second, home-to-school distance is part of very
complex choices that could be tightened with residential location choice and other long-
term decisions as well. This school of thought mentions when parents attempt to enact a
school choice other than their current close school, they might even end up taking on a
change in residential location to move into the desired school district. Therefore, travel
distance is not actually a choice, but rather a consequence of school choice. According to
this viewpoint, travel distance is an exogenous variable in the mode choice model, in which
a joint formulation for the modes may be undermined.
    This study argues for the significance of a joint formulation for school travel mode and
distance, no matter which viewpoint is followed. We test a copula-based joint multinomial
discrete–continuous model framework to account explicitly for common unobserved fac-
tors that may affect both the mode choice and travel distance decisions. We also compare a
joint copula model for travel mode and distance with single distance (linear regression) and
travel mode (multinomial logit) models. This analysis is conducted in Tehran, with more
than 5300 schools and 1.1 million registered k-12 students (Statistics of Minister of
Education 2012). Absence of such studies in the Middle East with arguably different
culture, attitudes, and preferences, further motivated this research.
    The remainder of this study is structured as follows. First, a critical review of the
literature is provided. Then, the modeling method is explained, followed by a description
of the empirical data. The estimation results of the joint model is proposed and compared
to the single models. Finally, the paper ends with policy recommendations and concluding
remarks.

Background
Many studies (Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008; McDonald and Aalborg 2009; Ermagun
et al. 2015a) have analyzed factors that influence travel behavior in school trips. Table 1
shows some of the past studies with a wide diversity in geographic contexts, time spans,
and analysis methods. Past studies typically used statistical description (McDonald and
Aalborg 2009) or a binary logit model specification (McMillan 2007) to model travel
mode. Further, a few studies (Wilson et al. 2010; McDonald 2008) have used multinomial
logit formulation to examine a broader range of modes. Independent from irrelevant
alternatives (IIA), a restrictive property of multinomial logit formulation on choices (Train
2009) is remedied, to an extent, in very few studies (Ermagun and Samimi 2015).
   Factors affecting the choice of travel mode in school trips can be categorized in four
classes: (1) student characteristics, (2) household demographics, (3) urban design and built
environment, and (4) parental reservations. As shown in Table 2, some parameters are
found to have contradictory effects on school trip modal selection. This difference could be
caused by non-uniformity of samples and difference of surrounding conditions. For
example, age of students could change certain travel behaviors, and thus, paradoxical
conclusions may be reached in studies that target dissimilar age groups. Student gender is
another characteristic with a determining role in mode choice. Many studies (Nelson et al.
2008; McDonald 2008) found a higher tendency to use active modes for boys than girls.
However, a broad study (Leslie et al. 2010) among students aged 10–14 in Australia
showed a stronger tendency for girls to choose walking more than boys.
   Among the factors related to household characteristics, income and vehicle ownership
have a significant influence on the choice of travel modes. All studies (Ermagun and
Levinson 2016; Wen et al. 2008) found that families with private cars are more willing to
use this mode to transport their children. Also, children in high income families are more
likely to use private car compared to walking or taking transit (Wilson et al. 2010).
   Distance from home to school is among the built environment factors that affect travel
mode in school trips. All the previous studies (Wilson et al. 2007; Mitra et al. 2010; Larsen
et al. 2009) showed a negative relationship between distance and tendency to use active
modes of travel. The significance of this variable is such that some studies tried to
determine a tolerable walking distance. In particular, Ermagun et al. (2016) developed a
two-step framework encompassing a random utility method and a hazard-based model.
They showed 85% of students fail to walk when their travel distance exceeds 1.9 km.
Nelson et al. (2008) found 82% of Irish students from 15 to 17 years that live closer than
2.4 km from school tend to walk. Schlossberg et al. (2006) mentioned that 52% of students
who live in a 1.6 km buffer around their schools either walk or bike to school.
   Long-term effects of school siting in urban development policies are undeniable. For
example, in 1958 American policymakers argued in favor of establishing larger schools,
and argued that it would improve learning opportunities for students (Walberg 1992).
Between 1940 and 2001, the U.S. population increased 70% while the number of public
schools fell by 69% (Ewing et al. 2004; Walberg 1992). Many students did not live near
their school, which meant fewer opportunities for walking or biking. Understanding the
effects of travel distance on the mode choice of students, the U.S. government started to
build a greater number of neighborhood schools (Council of Educational Facility Planners,
International 2004). Hence, recognizing the factors that influence school trip distance and
the reasons for such decisions by the parents is essential for long-term solutions toward
promoting active travel modes to school.

    This study is an effort to augment the current literature of school trips by developing a
joint formulation for school travel mode and distance. This model is presented and com-
pared with the conventional single models to highlight the significance of model specifi-
cation in terms of policy assessment. Further, lack of school travel behavior studies in the
Middle East propelled this research to shed light on the cultural impacts of travel decisions.
We account for parents’ perception of safety, convenience, and reliability when deciding
on school trip mode and distance. These factors have received little, if any, attention in
previous studies.
Method
Joint models are not necessarily adopted for simultaneous decisions. Indeed, when two
variables are modeled jointly, interdependencies of the error terms are accounted for. There
are several studies that jointly modeled decisions that are not made simultaneously in
practice, but, have common unobserved factors. Spissu et al. (2009) developed a joint
model of vehicle type choice and utilization using the 2000 San Francisco Bay Area Travel
Survey. They underlined that the introduced joint discrete–continuous model system
explicitly accounts for common unobserved factors that may affect the choice and uti-
lization of a certain vehicle type. Habib (2012) also tested a joint trivariate discrete–
continuous–continuous model for commuters’ mode choice, work start time, and work
duration to capture correlations among random components influencing these decisions. In
a more recent study, Habib (2015) developed a joint model to investigate not only the
factors affecting mode choice and travel distance of older people, but also their interre-
lationship. Likewise, school travel mode and distance could have several common unob-
served variables, such as neighborhood walkability, safety and security perceptions,
cultural preferences, and subject well-being that favor a joint formulation whether or not
these decisions are made jointly in practice.
    Several studies investigated a variety of methods to model interdependent decisions in a
joint structure in recent decades. A simple approach is to combine various choices of
different decisions (bundling), make new choices, and then calibrate a random utility
model to predict choice behaviors (Ermagun et al. 2015b; Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008;
De Jong and Ben-Akiva 2007). Although the use of a multinomial logit specification is
open to question, one may address such shortcomings with a generalized extreme value
model specification. Another approach employs a copula function that is mostly celebrated
for its closed-form formulation and efficient estimations (Trivedi and Zimmer 2007). We
test a joint copula model of multinomial logit and linear regression, respectively, for travel
mode and distance in school trips. In the following, the modeling methods of the mode
choice and travel distance are discussed, which is followed by a discussion of the joint
copula method.
Mode choice model
A multinomial logit model is used to explain travel mode selection among four alterna-
tives, namely automobile, school bus, public transit, and walk. Utility of mode i. for
household q. is formulated as Eq. 1, where xqi . is an observed attribute and eqi stands for
the unobserved part of the utility or a random error term (Greene 2003).
                                                                                   123

                                                    uqi ¼ bi xqi þ eqi :                                      ð1Þ
    Pursuant to the random utility maximization theory, household q chooses mode i. that
comes with the highest utility (Eq. 2).
                                  Vqi ¼ max uqj  eqi and bi xqi [ Vqi :                                      ð2Þ
                                               j6¼i
    Assuming independent and identical type-1 extreme value distribution for the error, the
closed form probability for selecting mode i. by household q. (Fqi .) is shown in Eq. 3
(Greene 2003).
                                                                       

                                              Fqi ¼ P                    :                                  ð3Þ

Travel distance model
A regression model is used to model home-to-school travel distance for each mode of
transportation. Travel distance is modeled using Eq. 4, where mqi . is travel distance for
household q. with mode i, ci . is the vector of regression coefficients, zqi is the vector of
observed attributes sqi is the error term.
                                                   mqi ¼ ci zqi þ sqi :                                       ð4Þ
The joint model: a copula-based approach
The error terms of the logit and regression models are assumed to be type-1 extreme value
and normal, respectively. Sklar (1959) showed that a joint distribution for two marginal
distributions can be approximated by the copulas, as shown in Eq. 5. In this equation,
Feqi ð:Þ and Fsqi ð:Þ are marginal distributions, Ch ð:; :Þ is the copula function to generate the
joint distribution, and h is the copula parameter. We considered four types of copulas:
Frank, Clayton, FGM, and Joe; and reported the one with the best fit. Bhat and Eluru
(2009) suggested estimating Kendall’s parameter instead of h for a better interpretation of
dependency between the marginal distributions. This is discussed later in more details.
                                                                                  

Estimation method
The overall Maximum Likelihood function is written as in Eq. 6 (Bhat and Eluru 2009),
where fsi ð:Þ is the probability density function of eqi and ui1 and ui2 are the cumulative
                                                                                                           

Data
Tehran is ranked the 16th most densely populated city in the world (City Mayors 2013),
with a population of about 8 million. Over 17 million motorized trips are made daily in this
city, 27% of which are educational (Tehran Comprehensive Traffic and Transportation
Study Co. 2013). About 5300 schools are spread across the city with an area of over 700
square km. Fifty-four percent of schools are private, and they arguably have higher quality.
Private schools often accept their students as freshman, and transfers are barely accepted
by top-ranked private schools. Although public schools are more affordable, one needs to
live in the school district to be eligible for the enrollment much like school districts in the
United States. Private schools do not have the same criteria for enrollment, and the students
only need to be able to afford the tuition costs and typically pass the entrance exam to
attend.
   Unlike the Western countries, there are many small neighborhood schools with very
few classes in Tehran. This has made the school density of Tehran to be about 7.5
schools per squared KM, which is relatively high, compared to an average school density
of 3.4, 2.9, 2.1, and 1.6, in Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, and Los Angeles,
respectively.
   To develop the models, we used four categories of data: (1) students travel infor-
mation, (2) socio-economic data of the households, (3) built-environment specifications,
and (4) transportation characteristics. The last two sets of data were obtained from
Tehran Comprehensive Traffic and Transportation Study Co. (2013). While, an exten-
sive survey was conducted in May 2011 in Tehran to collect students’ travel infor-
mation and socio-economic information of households. More than 4900 questionnaires
were distributed among nearly 100 middle and high schools after a pilot survey. Forms
were completed by the parents, and a response rate of 72% was obtained. Since schools
in Tehran are gender-segregated, cluster sampling with respect to gender, level, and
area of residence was conducted. Five common modes of transportation, including
walking, cycling, school bus, private car, and public transport were considered. It
should be noted that school busing in Tehran is different than in Western countries, in
that it is neither free nor provided by the State. Rather, school busing is a chartered
service that using minibuses, minivans, or private cars to provide door-to-door service
for families that choose to pay. The cost of the service is not fixed and depends on the
child’s distance to the school. Since less than 1% of students reported biking to school,
this data was removed from the mode choice analysis. The low share of biking may
result from the lack of on- and off-street bicycle facilities and the ‘‘prohibition’’ of
biking for girls.
   To measure the distance from home to school variable, we extracted the walking travel
time from Google maps using the origin and destination of each trip. We then transferred
the walking travel time to commute distance, considering an average walking speed of
4.8 km/h for children. Figure 1 shows the percentage of each mode classified by travel
distance from home to school. Moreover, Table 3 shows the data used in this study as well
as some demographics.

Model
We developed a copula–based joint modeling framework for school travel mode and
distance. Single models are also reported to make out the impact of modeling method on
the estimated coefficients.
Joint model
Four common types of copula formulations, namely Frank, FJM, Clayton, and Joe were
studied to select the appropriate model. Due to the use of non-nested copulas in this study,
evaluation of different types cannot be done by the likelihood ratio test (Bhat and Eluru
2009). Thus, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) statistic is recommended to compare
the models (Trivedi and Zimmer 2007). The model with lower BIC better fits the data.
Results of the Frank copula, which has the best fit, are reported in Table 4.
   One of the main goals of this study is to show that the error terms of the school trip
mode and distance models are interdependent. This is well illustrated by the value of
copula dependence parameters. As shown, these parameters are significant and different
form zero. This demonstrates a high level of dependency between the unobserved factors
of the travel mode and distance models.
   The results indicate that the choice of walking is more dependent on travel distance than
other modes. In other words, preference of walking regularly to school affects parents’
choice of school location and vise-versa. Kendall correlation parameter is used to interpret
the dependency parameter. It should be noted that interpretation of this factor varies across
different copulas. Bhat and Eluru (2009) described the sign of this parameter in different
copula models. In this study, the relationship between the error terms are opposite in sign,
as shown in Eqs. 2 and 4. In Frank model, this negative sign indicates that unobserved
factors, which increase the probability of choosing a mode, are likely to increase travel
distance. Conversely, a positive sign indicates that unobserved factors cause a decrease in
the probability of choosing a special mode in a longer distance. The estimated copula
dependency parameter for walking and distance is negative, contrary to other transporta-
tion modes. Possible reasons for this difference could be hypothesized. For example, the

preference of some parents that choose active transportation modes due to its health
benefits is not considered in the systematic part of the utility. The negative sign of the
dependency parameter implies that such factors that encourage walking are more likely to
increase travel distance from home to school. Similarly, students who prefer to walk in
order to socialize are inclined to travel longer distances than other students.
    Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the effect of variables. Most variables are sig-
nificant at 90% of confidence interval. The smallest t-value is for GENDER in the
regression model of walking and DURATION for regression model of public

Single models
A summary of the single models are outlined in Table 5. A multinomial logit and a linear
regression model are provided, respectively, for school trip mode and distance. The
explanatory variables are similar to the joint model, but the estimated coefficients and
standard errors are somehow different.
   In the logit model, all the explanatory variables are significant at a 95% confidence
interval, except for SAFETY, TRF_LIMIT, and POPDENS. The latter two variables appear
in the utility function of the Walk mode with a 90% confidence interval, and SAFETY
appears in the Public mode’s utility function with a 75% level of significance. Further, the
model has an adjusted R-squared of 0.35.
   In the regression model, on the other hand, NON_WRK, and TRF_LIMIT, respectively
in the Private, and Sch. Bus models are significant at a 90% confidence interval. While,
GENDER and DURATION are significant at an 85% confidence interval, respectively in
the Public, and Walk models.
Joint model versus single models
Differences between the joint and single models’ coefficients are reported in Table 6. Wald
test is deployed to measure the statistical significance between zero and the estimated
differences. In the travel mode coefficients, walk time to school, and travel safety per-
ception in the Walk alternative has a statistically different coefficient, respectively, in a
95% and 90% confidence. Further, SB_N_COST in Sch. Bus mode, WALKTRNT in Public
mode, and WALKSCH in Private mode have different coefficients with a 40% confidence.
The remaining coefficients in the joint and single mode choice models are not statistically
different. In the distance models, on the other hand, AGE has slightly different coefficients
with a 40% confidence interval.
Discussion
This part of the study is devoted to assess the impacts of different variables on school trip
modes and distance according to the joint model. Variables are examined in four cate-
gories: student characteristics, household demographics, built environment, and parental
reservations.
Student characteristics
Gender and age were found significant among student characteristics. The results indicate
that boys are more probable to either use public transit or walk to school. It is more
probable that girls use the school bus rather than other modes of travel. This may be rooted
in the safety and security concerns of parents toward girls in Tehran.
   Younger students are less probable to use public transit or walk, and more probable to
take school bus. This probability may stem from the sense of independence in older
students and a reduction in parents’ travel safety concerns (McDonald and Aalborg 2009).
One may also hypothesize that older students tend to use independent modes such as public
transportation and walking to socialize and be more independent in Tehran (Samimi and
Ermagun 2012). Students’ age and travel distance are found to have a positive relation,
                                                                                  123

meaning that older students tend to travel longer distances. This change in distance is more
common for students who use public transportation more than other modes.
Socio-demographic variables
A variety of socio-demographic variables are found to have a significant effect on travel
mode and distance. Among these, income, education, car ownership, and travel cost are
found to be more influential.
    The results showed that students from high-income households are more probable to use
private cars and school bus. This is justified by the high travel cost of school bus in Tehran.
As alluded to previously, unlike the Western countries, school bus in Tehran is a door-to-
door expensive travel mode. Thus, it is not surprising that the prevalence of this mode is
high among high-income families. High income households who choose school bus, also,
do not show a significant sensitivity to travel distance. High income households that prefer
to walk to school, however, preferred shorter distances. We can conclude that high-income
families in Tehran are more probable to select private cars and school bus modes, and if
they are willing to allow their children to walk to school they select a closer school.
    Many studies (Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008; Ermagun and Samimi 2015) have
discussed the impact of car ownership on mode choice. All of them found a positive
correlation between car ownership and tendency to use personal vehicles for school trips.
Two dummy variables of NON_AUTO and AUTO_MOR2 were used to investigate this
influence in households with no car and households with more than two. The first variable
indicates the probability of using public transportation and walking increases for house-
holds that have no access to private car. Also, households with more than two private cars
are found to be more willing to use their car for dropping off their children at school.
    Parents’ occupation was found to affect both travel mode and distance. This variable is
more or less overlooked in previous studies (Wen et al. 2008). However, in line with some
previous studies (Yarlagadda and Srinivasan 2008; Wen et al. 2008), we found non-
workers are less inclined toward the use of active modes for their children’s school trips.
Also, unemployed parents that prefer motorized modes for their children’s travel to school
are not necessarily more inclined toward shorter distances.
    As noted in past studies (Martin et al. 2007), parents’ education affects students’ mode
choice. Educated parents, for instance, are found to discourage use of public transport or
walking to school. One reason for this behavior could be attributed to the relationship
between education and income. An interesting finding is that as the level of education
increases, the tendency to walk declines with a more moderate rate than tendency to use
public transit. Educated parents’ awareness of health benefits of regular walking to school
could be a reason for this behavior. The results, also, showed that an increase in the
education level of parents that prefer private car or school bus leads to an increase in travel
distance.
    Undoubtedly, travel cost of public transportation is influential on the probability of
using this mode. Some studies (Ermagun and Samimi 2015) have pointed to the importance
of this variable on the probability of choosing different transportation modes. It is expected
that high-income households are less affected by travel cost fluctuations. Therefore, we
divided cost of school bus by the household income (SB_N_COST), to identify systematic
taste variations among households.

Built environment variables
Most of the past studies (Wilson et al. 2010; Mitra et al. 2010; Ewing et al. 2004) found
that the tendency to use public transportation and walking decreases as home-to-school
distance increases. We brought in home-to-school distance in the utility of different modes
by WALKSCH. Results showed that the utility of walking, public transport, and private car
reduces with different magnitudes when the distance increases.
   Distance from home to the closest public transit station is another built environment
factor that has been disregarded in many previous studies. Understandably, our results
showed that the higher the public transit accessibility, the higher the utility to use this mode
for school trips. More illustration for this explanatory variable is provided in the next
section.
Parental reservation
Safety, convenience, reliability, travel time, and traffic limits are the parental concerns
whose effects on school travel mode and distance are examined. Apart from the first two
variables (safety and convenience), other parental reservations have been hardly consid-
ered in the previous studies (McDonald and Aalborg 2009; McMillan 2007). We found that
parents, who are concerned about their children’s safety, discourage public transportation
or walking as a mode of school travel. Moreover, those who have safety concerns but also
prefer to walk to school are more probable to live closer to schools.
   As expected, parents who are concerned about their children’s travel expenses, mostly
choose walking and public transportation compared to school bus and private car. Also,
households that choose walking due to cost-related reasons are more probable to travel
longer distances. In contrast, households that have decided to use school bus and have
travel expenses as one of their priorities, try to choose schools that are close to their
residence. Further, parents who have travel time concerns are more probable to take their
children by private car more than any other mode. Also, if they choose walking or public
transit for any reasons, they select schools that are located nearby.
   Another important concern is reliability. The results showed that attractiveness of public
transit and school bus, respectively, decreases and increases when parents are concerned
about school trip reliability. This is justified by the poor timing and frequency of public
transit system in Tehran. Also, parents who are more inclined toward private car or school
bus due to reliability concerns are less sensitive to travel distance.
Policy implication
Safety, traffic limits, distance from home to school, and cost of different transportation
modes are policy sensitive variables that we examined. Figure 2 shows the elasticities of
different variables on transportation mode choice, derived from the joint model results.
Elasticity is measured as the percentage change in the mode choice probability when a
given independent variable increases by one present. We examined elasticity of continuous
variables (e.g. income and home-to-school distance) at the average points. Effects of
dummy variables (e.g. safety perception) are computed as the percentage change in mode
choice probability, if that concern is eliminated completely. Elasticity of different variables
was examined on various population clusters such as girls, boys, and low-income

households. Such findings provide useful information for policy makers to better target
policies for different segments of the society.
   As shown in Fig. 2a, when household income increases by 1%, the probability of using
school bus and private car, respectively, rises by 0.19% and 0.07%. Further, probabilities
of using public transportation and walking decrease by 0.15 and 0.09%, respectively. The
cost of school bus is normalized by households’ income so one can observe a systematic
taste variation among families. This variable indicates that a 1% increase in the cost of
school bus decreases the probability of school bus choice by 0.17% and 0.08%, respec-
tively, for low and high income families. Such results are useful for policy makers who try
to decrease the usage of non-active modes by diverse pricing scenarios.

   As indicated earlier, a paramount variable in school travel mode is distance from home
to school. If home-to-school distance increases by 1%, probability of walking will reduce
by 0.85%, and propels parents toward non-active modes, especially the school bus.
Therefore, policy makers that try to promote active modes of transportation should notice
that a greater number of neighborhood schools can meet their desire in lieu of regional
schools.
   Availability of public transportation has not received due attention in previous studies.
Elasticity of access to transit station (WALKTRNT) showed that a 1% improvement in the
access increases the students’ propensity to take transit by 0.20%. It should be noted that

public transportation is a hybrid mode that implicitly includes some sort of physical
activity. Therefore, promoting this mode is an option for policy makers that strive to
ameliorate society’s health condition.
   Figure 2 illustrates how parental reservations on travel safety, traffic limits, and travel
duration influence their mode choice decisions. We found that safety is the main concern of
parents regarding their children’s school trip. Should this concern be addressed entirely,
the propensity to walk is expected to increase by 82%. Figure 2b shows the effect of safety
on different household types. For example, the utility of walking will increase 106% for
high-income and 67% for low-income families by removing travel safety concerns. Also,
families are more concerned about their girls’ safety. Elimination of safety concerns can
elevate walking propensity by 85% among girls and 76% among boys. Policy makers with
this kind of information can attain better results by applying different policies to different
demographic groups and locations. For example, policies such as safe route to school
(McDonald and Aalborg 2009) or walk-bus to school (Staunton et al. 2003) can help
alleviate parents’ concerns about their children’s safety. As illustrated in Fig. 2c, setting
traffic limits leads to a huge diminution in the use of private car. Results indicated that
removing traffic limits can boost the use of private cars by up to 262%. The consequences
of this variable are far-reaching. Therefore, considering appropriately-set traffic limits,
urban designers can potentially help in reducing the use of motorized modes for school
travel.
   Regarding travel time concerns, the results indicate that as parental concern for travel
time declines so does use of private vehicle. Figure 2d shows this decline fluctuates
between 42.0% and 52.3% among different socio-economic family strata. As a result, the
probability of school busing and public transit use increases significantly. Another inter-
pretation of this analysis is that the parents who have concerns for travel time prefer to use
private vehicle. In the case that private vehicle is unavailable, they prefer school bus over
public transit and walking.
Conclusion
While researchers and practitioners have focused on analyzing effective explanatory
variables on travel mode choice decisions as the key explanation for travel behavior in
school trips, many are shifting attention toward the commute distance and school location
decisions. It is essential to have a robust evaluation of effective variables on both school
travel mode and home-to-school distance, in order to encourage active transportation
among students. We tested a copula-based joint discrete–continuous model to unravel
mode choice and travel distance in a joint framework. A confirmatory evidence for our
hypothesis demonstrates that the error term of the school travel mode and distance are
significantly inter-related. Joint estimation of the models made a significant difference in
the effect of travel distance on willingness to walk to school. In fact, the absolute value of
the travel distance coefficient in the mode choice model increased by 22% when a joint
formulation was adopted instead of the conventional single estimations. Further, we found
a significant decrease of 19% in the coefficient of travel safety perception in the joint mode
choice model compared to the single model. Thus, single estimation of the models is
technically a model misspecification that could result in distorted estimates. This depen-
dency between the errors is more pronounced for the walking mode, according to Kendall’s
dependency parameter.

   Furthermore, this study evaluated the effect of a range of variables such as distance
from home to school, travel cost, safety and traffic limits on the school travel mode choice
behavior among different demographic segments. For example, we evidenced that elimi-
nating parents’ concern about safety can double the propensity of walking to school. In the
final model, the demographic heterogeneity was considered in evaluating the effect of each
variable. High and low income families, for instance, are expected to respectively show
106% and 67% increase in the probability of walking, if their safety concerns are elimi-
nated. Such findings can further provide information to policy makers for devising targeted
policy measures to increase physically active travel to school among the different segments
of the society.
   While the results of this research offer some insights into the role of mode choice and
home-school distance by using a copula-based modeling framework, there are limitations
to the study that could be addressed in the future.
• Walkability of the neighborhood should be added to the model to avoid potential model
    misspecification. Built-environment variables such as density of green space, school,
    sidewalk and other land-use variables that are expected to promote walking trips were
    not utilized, due to unavailability of disaggregated data in this study.
• The way that students are accompanied to school could be modeled jointly with the
    travel mode and distance in a three dimensional joint model.
• The choice of school distance is really the choice of school location or school itself.
    The school location choice is affected by many explanatory variables such as quality of
    school, registration cost, and quality of the school’s neighborhood. However, these
    variables are not publically available in our case study to take into account in the
    modeling process.
