  Key Messages
   Children have meaningful insight to offer towards a better understanding of how their local
     environment influences active school travel behaviours.
   The use of participatory mapping and qualitative GIS methodology provides a unique opportunity for
     children to share their spatial knowledge.
   Furthering our understanding of how children’s perceptions influence their journey to and from
     school will help to inform policy and practice supporting localized active school travel
     interventions.
Children today are spending more sedentary time indoors than time playing and being active outdoors. The
daily journey to and from school represents a valuable opportunity for children to be physically active
through active school travel. The majority of research on children’s active school travel omits children from
the research process even though children interpret their environments in fundamentally different ways than
adults. Our research uses innovative participatory mapping and qualitative GIS methods to examine how
children’s perceptions of their environments in<U+FB02>uence their school journey experiences. Through our
thematic analysis of 25 map-based focus groups, we identi<U+FB01>ed three main themes characterizing barriers
and enablers to active school travel: safety-related, material, and affective features. By positioning children
as experts of their environments in our participatory methodology, our <U+FB01>ndings provide an important
counterpoint to the adultist privilege characterizing the majority of research on children’s active school
travel. Environmental features that mattered for children’s school journeys took on multiple meanings in
their eyes, demonstrating that children’s perspectives must be engaged to inform interventions to promote
active school travel. We thus argue that identifying barriers and enablers to active school travel for children
requires engaging children’s views.
