1. Introduction
    Physical activity is essential for optimal health and development in children and youth (Strong et al., 2005). Children’s activity can
be accumulated in a number of ways, in particular through structured/organised sports and recreational activities, physical education,
active/unstructured free play, school-based activity, and active transportation (e.g., walking and cycling), all of which have distinct
benefits (Salmon and Timperio, 2007). Active transportation is a behavior of particular interest, due to low cost, regularity of behavior,
potential for contributing to community cohesion, and associations with physical activity (Schoeppe et al., 2013; World Health Or­
ganization, 2018). Findings from the International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISoCOLE) including
over 6000 children from twelve countries showed that children who used active transport accumulated an average of 6 min more of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per weekday (95% CI 4.7–7.3) than their peers who used motorized transport (Denstel
et al., 2015). Given low levels of participation in MVPA internationally, this difference has meaningful implications for health, with
any small increase an important one (Ekelund et al., 2012). Importantly, active travelers in the ISoCOLE study were also significantly
more likely to accumulate 60 min of MVPA per day than children who used motorized transport. This level of physical activity is
recommended due to demonstrated relationships with optimal cardiovascular, metabolic, and bone health (Strong et al., 2005; US
Department of Health and Human Services, 2008; World Health Organization, 2010). Evidence also suggests active transportation may
help maintain a healthy body weight (although more research in this area is needed) (Faulkner et al., 2009; Larouche et al., 2014), and
contribute to improved cardiovascular fitness (especially for cycling) (Larouche et al., 2014). Reduction in the rates of motorized
transportation modes in favour of active transportation is also beneficial for environmental health, including reduced traffic
congestion and noise and air pollution, ultimately contributing to urban vitality and climate change mitigation (World Health Or­
ganization, 2018). Despite these benefits, active transportation in New Zealand children and youth is low and has declined signifi­
cantly over recent decades (Ministry of Transport, 2014).
    A socio-ecological approach recognizes the fundamental role of family and peers, school settings, community environment, and
government policies in supporting child and youth active transportation (Ikeda et al., 2018a, 2018b; Pont et al., 2009). High quality
evidence is necessary to inform active transportation intervention and programme design, to measure the effectiveness of in­
terventions, identify inequities, and understand trends in active transportation behaviours over time. While acknowledging the
importance of culturally and contextually relevant evidence, global comparisons can also be helpful where insights can be gained from
countries with higher than average levels of participation in active transportation.
    The global physical activity matrix has been led by the Active Healthy Kids Global Alliance (AHKGA) since 2014 (Tremblay et al.,
2014). This international collaboration uses a harmonised process for evaluating how countries are performing in relation to children’s
physical activity behaviours (including active transportation) and related environmental contexts. The indicators capture a range of
physical activity behaviours and outcomes, specifically: overall physical activity (%meeting recommended physical activity levels of at
least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity per day), organised sport and physical activity (% participating in sport and/or physical
activity programs), active play (% reporting being outside for several hours a day; % engaging in unstructured/unorganized active play
for several hours a day), active transportation (% using active transportation to get to and from places), sedentary behaviours (% who
have no more than 2 h of screen time per day, and physical fitness (average percentile achieved on physical fitness indicators; 2018
only; not all countries reported this indicator). Indicators were also used to assess activity contexts, specifically family and peers,
schools, community settings and environments, and government policies. Country-specific Physical Activity Report Cards are useful
for raising awareness and advocating for health promoting policies and environments for healthy, active children and youth. In 2014
the first Global Matrix was released, including results from 15 countries across five continents (Tremblay et al., 2014). In 2016 the
Global Matrix 2.0 involved 38 countries across six continents (Tremblay et al., 2016), and in 2018 the Global Matrix 3.0 involved 49
countries across six continents (Aubert et al., 2018a) including 30 very high Human Development Index countries (Aubert et al.,
2018b). Findings have been used to identify gaps in physical activity surveillance and research, and to advocate for interventions and
strategies to improve health outcomes for children and youth (Aubert et al., 2018a).
    New Zealand has participated in each wave of the global matrix, producing long (Maddison et al., 2014b; Smith et al., 2018b) and
short (Smith et al., 2018a) reports, academic manuscripts (Maddison et al., 2014a, 2016; Smith et al., 2018c), and numerous con­
ference presentations. In 2018, due to the large number of countries participating, each country produced a short report rather than
full manuscript, limiting opportunities to provide detail on data sources and equity in physical activity participation, or to consider
differences in physical activity indicators across time periods. The purpose of this article is three-fold: (1) to provide details on the
development of New Zealand’s 2018 Report Card, including key data sources and results for population subgroups focusing on active
transportation; (2) to examine trends in active school transportation across the three time periods; and (3) to reflect on the different
methods, surveys, and results across the three New Zealand Physical Activity Report Cards with regard to active transportation and
implications of methodological approaches and available data sources for monitoring and promoting active transportation.
2. Methods
2.1. Global matrix 3.0
    Ten Global Matrix 3.0 indicators and benchmarks for use in Physical Activity Report Cards were generated from previous report
cards and feedback from a workshop at the Global Matrix 2.0 release (Aubert et al., 2018a). In 2018, changes from previous years
included the addition of a new indicator (Physical Fitness), and modifications to benchmarks (e.g., for overall physical activity, the
benchmark changed from “at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day” to “at least 60 min of
                                                                    2

M. Smith et al.                                                                                         Journal of Transport & Health 15 (2019) 100789
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day on average.”) No changes were made to the active transportation indicator. Grading
criteria are outlined in Table 1. Countries were advised to synthesise national data from the previous five years, that included
school-aged children and youth (approximately 5–17 years of age). Each country submitted draft grades and their rationale to the
AHKGA Executive Committee for auditing prior to finalization of grades and report cards.
2.2. New Zealand 2018 Physical Activity Report Card grade development
     In 2018, a panel of national experts in children’s physical activity was convened by the lead author (MS). Experts were identified
through their previous involvement in New Zealand Physical Activity Report Cards and recent published research in areas aligning
with the report card indicators. Individual panel members took responsibility for identifying key datasets, sourcing data, and
generating preliminary grades for discussion with the panel. Most correspondence was via email, video or telephone conferences, with
minimal face-to-face meetings (limited to Auckland-based researchers only). All panel members contributed to grading indicators
through identification of pertinent data sources, and discussion and agreement on the final grades.
     Data sources were identified through academic and grey literature, and online searches which were conducted between October
2017 and May 2018. To distinguish new data arising since the publication of the 2016 Physical Activity Report Card, data sources were
limited to those published between the years 2015–2018. Where data were not publicly available, authors or organisations were
contacted directly to request access to anonymised datasets or summary statistics.
     A 3-tier hierarchy for strength of evidence was employed to weight the contribution of data sources to the final grade. Nationally
representative datasets (Tier 1) were prioritised. Regional representative datasets or national non-representative datasets were clas­
sified as Tier 2, and were used either in the absence of Tier 1 data sets, or to supplement the grades where appropriate. Regional, non-
representative datasets were considered as Tier 3 and only used either in the absence of Tier 1 or Tier 2 datasets, or where objective
data were available in the Tier 3 dataset but not in Tier 1 or Tier 2 datasets.
2.3. Trends in active transportation across the 2014, 2016, and 2018 New Zealand Physical Activity Report Cards
     The Global Matrix definition for active transportation across all three report cards was any form of human-powered transportation
(e.g., walking, cycling, using a wheelchair, in-line skating, skateboarding, scootering). The benchmarking criteria used across all three
report cards was the percentage of children and youth who used active transportation to get to and from places (e.g., school, park, mall,
friend’s house). There was no defined frequency of active transportation for this benchmark (e.g., at least x number of trips per day/
week, or reporting active transportation as the usual mode of transport).
     Data sources varied across the three time points, as detailed in Table 2. In some cases this was due to unavailability of current data.
For example, active transportation was not assessed in children participating in the longitudinal Growing up in New Zealand study in
2014 or 2016 as they were aged 2 and 4 years at the time of the survey, respectively. In the case of the New Zealand Household Travel
Survey and the New Zealand Secondary School Sport Census, different inclusion criteria employed across Physical Activity Report
Cards resulted in inconsistent approaches to whether survey data were included or not. Descriptions of data sources from 2014 to 2016
have been detailed elsewhere (Maddison et al., 2014a, 2016). Data sources used to calculate the active transportation grade for the
2018 Physical Activity Report Card including questions used to measure active transportation are outlined in Table 3 and described
below. As can be seen from Table 3, and the proceeding text, survey methods and questions used to calculate the active transportation
grades varied substantially among different datasets.
     The New Zealand health survey is a nationwide survey run by the health and disability intelligence group within the Ministry of
Health (Ministry of Health, 2017b). Survey findings are used to monitor population health and provide evidence to inform policy and
strategic development. The survey comprises a set of core items with rotating additional module topics. A multi-stage, stratified,
proportional-to-size sampling design is used, selecting potential respondents using both area-based and list-based electoral roll
samples. Over 13,000 adults and 4000 parents/caregivers of children aged 0–14 years participate in the survey every year. The

    For the 2016 Physical Activity Report Card, the New Zealand Health Survey was prioritised as the primary source of data.
  b
     This census was ranked as Tier 2 evidence due to lack of clarity around the data being nationally representative and lack of clarity on meth­
odology. Because Tier 1 evidence existed, this survey was considered in contextualising results, but not actually used in the active transportation
grade calculations for any report cards. It has been included in this table in the interest of completeness of reporting available datasets in New
Zealand.
2016/17 survey collected data from July 2016 to June 2017. Eighty percent of the invited parents/caregivers participated in the
2016/17 survey. Weighting was used to ensure data were representative of the New Zealand population. The New Zealand Health
Survey provides robust and consistent subgroup comparisons for key demographic groups as follows: sex (boys versus girls), ethnicity
(Ma <U+FFFD>ori versus non-Ma  <U+FFFD>ori, Pacific versus non-Pacific, Asian versus non-Asian) for the entire sample and separately for boys and girls,
and area-level socio-economic deprivation (most deprived versus least deprived). Changes over time are also assessed for these key
demographic groups.
    The active New Zealand youth survey was launched by sport New Zealand in 2017 (Sport New Zealand, 2018). This is a na­
tionally representative continuous survey of New Zealanders aged five and upwards. Survey topics include organised sport and
physical activity participation, screen time, and active transportation. Multi-stage probability stratified sampling was employed using
the electoral roll and data were collected between January 17 to January 2018. For 5–17 year olds, an online survey was administered.
Parents/caregivers responded on behalf of children aged 5–11 years, and those aged 12–17 years self-completed the online survey,
with a final sample size of 6004 children and young people (32% response rate). Weighting is used to ensure data are representative of
the New Zealand Regional Sports Trust population using 2013 Census statistics. Study-specific subgroup comparisons for sex, ethnicity,
age, and area-level socio-economic deprivation were undertaken for this study.
    Growing Up in New Zealand is a longitudinal study of child development. The child cohort consists of 6853 children who were
recruited through their pregnant mothers (n ¼ 6822) who were due to have their babies between the 25th of April 2009 and the 25th of
March 2010. The geographical area chosen for recruitment was the region of the North Island covered by the three contiguous District
Health Boards (DHBs) of Auckland, Counties Manukau and Waikato. The cohort recruited is broadly generalisable to all New Zealand
children in terms of ethnicity and sociodemographic status (Morton et al., 2015). The data used for the Physical Activity Report Card is
from the 72 month data collection wave of Growing Up in New Zealand. This data collection was an electronic data collection that was
completed by mothers of the cohort children when their child was approximately 6 years of age (n ¼ 5709).
    The New Zealand household travel survey is undertaken by the Ministry of Transport (Ministry of Transport, 2018). The survey
involves households completing a 2-day (2003-mid 2015) or 7-day (mid 2015-mid 2018) travel diary of trips made and mode of travel
for each trip. Households are randomly selected for participation from primary sampling units and visited in person to recruit in­
dividuals living within the household, including children and youth aged 5–17 years. In 2016, 40% of households invited fully
completed the survey; 61% of households had at least one individual complete the survey. Weighting is applied to ensure data are
representative of the New Zealand population.
    The Health and Lifestyles survey is managed by the Health Promotion Agency (Health Promotion Agency, 2017). It is a biennial
survey of health behaviours and attitudes of adults aged <U+FFFD>15 years and parents/caregivers of children and youth aged 5–16 years
(Health Promotion Agency, 2017). Multi-stage area-based sampling using meshblocks (i.e., smallest geographic units for which sta­
tistical data are collected and processed in New Zealand) was employed to recruit one adult or parent/caregiver in eligible households.
Participants were interviewed face-to-face in their usual residence. In 2016, the weighted survey response rate for parents/caregivers
was 65%. Weighted statistics are generated to ensure the data are representative of the New Zealand population.

3. Results
    Grades for the active transportation indicator have remained consistently low across three report cards – the active transportation
grade was C in 2014 and this was lowered to C- in 2016 and 2018. Rates of active transportation in surveys used for the 2018 Physical
Activity Report Card ranged from 24% of six year olds in the Growing up in New Zealand Survey (D-) (Morton et al., 2010) to 45% of
children and youth aged 5–14 years in the New Zealand Health Survey (C-) (Ministry of Health, 2017a). In the Active New Zealand
Youth Survey 43% of children and youth aged 5–17 years old usually used active transport to and from school (C-) (Sport New Zealand,
2018). Data from the Health and Lifestyles survey (D) (Health Promotion Agency, 2017) and the New Zealand Household Travel
Survey (D) (Ministry of Transport, 2018) showed that just under a third of children used active transportation to school and/or other
destinations.
    Subgroup differences were observed in active transportation rates across all three time periods; however, these were not consistent
across surveys or New Zealand Report Cards. In 2014, 2016, findings from the New Zealand Health Survey showed children and youth
who lived in more deprived areas had a significantly higher likelihood of active transportation to school compared with those residing
in least deprived areas (Ministry of Health, 2013, 2017a). The only significant subgroup difference in 2018 was for Pacific boys, who
were 1.19 (95% CI 1.01–1.41) times more likely to actively travel to school than their non-Pacific peers (controlled for age). Significant
decreases in prevalence of active transportation to school have been observed between the 2011/2012 and 2016/2017 New Zealand
Health Surveys for M<U+FFFD>   aori girls (54.3% versus 39.3%, p < 0.01), all Ma       <U+FFFD>ori children and youth (51.6% versus 44.1%, p ¼ 0.02), and
Pacific girls (55.9% versus 41.0%, p ¼ 0.01).
    The Active New Zealand Youth Survey also examined differences between subgroups. Boys were significantly more likely to use
active transportation to get to and from school (46% versus 40%). Children and youth of Asian ethnicity had significantly higher rates
of active transportation than children of New Zealand European or Ma           <U+FFFD>ori ethnicity (48%, 42%, and 40%, respectively). Children and
youth aged 12–14 years had significantly higher rates of active transportation than other age groups (49% versus 36–43%). Children
aged 5–7 years had significantly lower rate of active transportation than other age groups (36% versus 41–49%). No significant dif­
ferences in the rates of active transportation were observed by area-level socio-economic status.

4. Discussion
    Results of New Zealand Physical Activity Report cards indicated that rates of active transportation among New Zealand children
and youth are low and continue to decline. Heterogeneity in methodology and measurement of active transportation limited the ability
to track changes in travel patterns over time and compare results across surveys. Therefore, future efforts in New Zealand should focus
on promoting active transportation to and from school and other destinations and standardising measurements of active transportation
across national surveys.
    Given the high levels of physical inactivity and increasingly sedentary lifestyles among children and adolescents globally (Aubert
et al., 2018a) as well as in New Zealand (Smith et al., 2018c), low and declining rates of active transportation in New Zealand are
concerning and could further reduce opportunities for physical activity in these age groups. If this pattern continues in New Zealand,
there may be a risk of socio-economic, ethnic, and gender inequities, particularly given the decreases in the rates of active trans­
portation among Ma   <U+FFFD>ori children/youth and Pacific girls reported here. Considering the multiple health benefits of active trans­
portation for children and youth, encouraging and increasing rates of active transportation to and from school has been emphasized as
a key policy recommendation in New Zealand (Mandic et al., 2019) and internationally (World Health Organization, 2018).
    In New Zealand children and youth, common barriers to active transportation to school and other destinations include distance
(Ikeda et al., 2018b), social norms (Hawley et al., 2019), lack of family, peer and/or school support (Mandic et al., 2017a), convenience
of car travel (Ikeda et al., 2019; Mandic et al., 2017a), inclement weather (Mandic et al., 2017a), built environment characteristics of
home and school neighbourhoods (e.g., street connectivity, safety from traffic) (Ikeda et al., 2019; Pocock et al., 2019), and neigh­
bourhood perceptions, particularly child and parent traffic safety concerns (Ikeda et al., 2019; Mandic et al., 2017a; Smith et al., 2019).
In addition, country-specific factors such as high rates of private vehicle ownership (Environmental Health Indicators New Zealand,
2017), cycle helmet legislation (Molina-García et al., 2018), cycling skills (Mandic et al., 2018), school uniform requirements (Hopkins
and Mandic, 2017), and school choice policies (Mandic et al., 2017b), further impact travelling patterns of New Zealand children and
youth. This evidence suggests multi-sectoral approaches including urban planning, school-level and community-level initiatives,
culturally appropriate approaches, social marketing campaigns, and family support are all required to enable active transportation for
children and adolescents in New Zealand.
    Multiple high quality data sources existed to measure participation in active transportation in New Zealand’s 2018 Report Card.
However, these data sources were limited to understanding transport modes for the school journey only and so provides a limited
understanding of children’s total active transport. Children and youth use active transport to travel to destinations beyond school
(Clemens and Lincoln, 2018; Dollman and Lewis, 2007). It is also possible that a pattern of no active school transport does not
necessarily translate to having no active transport to other destinations for individuals. Unaccompanied or unsupervised trips (i.e.,
independent mobility) made are also not assessed in the Physical Activity Report Card criteria, and datasets do not exist to understand
this behavior at the national level in New Zealand. These forms of active transportation may have unique benefits for accumulating
physical activity, social relationships, child development, and mental health (Marzi and Reimers, 2018). It would thus be worth
considering both active transport to destinations beyond school, and independent mobility, in future national surveys and Physical
Activity Report Card assessments. It should also be acknowledged that terms, definitions, measurements and thresholds for active
transportation differed across years and individual surveys, and even across survey waves. For example, active transportation variables
in 2018 generally focused on the mode of travel that is mostly, most regularly (including consideration of time), or usually used for
travel to (and sometimes from) school. The New Zealand Household Travel Survey was an exception, where all trip modes and
purposes were recorded. However, in this survey the duration of measurement has changed across waves - from a 2-day period between
2003 and 2014 survey waves (to mid 2015) to a 7-day period for the 2015 to 2017 waves (to mid 2018), and has since reverted to a
2-day assessment period. As well as obvious changes to representativeness of usual travel patterns across time, these changes also
impact comparability across surveys more broadly (e.g., through impacting recruitment and introducing potential selection bias).
Consequently, time series comparisons using these surveys as the sole data source is not recommended by the New Zealand Transport
Agency. To some extent, triangulation of multiple data sources, as in the Physical Activity Report Cards, may assuage some of the
limitations due to changing methodologies across time in individual surveys. The New Zealand Health Survey was the only survey with
up to date evidence available at all time points of the New Zealand Physical Activity Report Cards (Ministry of Health, 2013, 2015,
2017b). Moreover, the item used to assess active transportation in the New Zealand Health Survey had remained identical across all
survey phases, yielding consistent data to enable comparison of active transportation over survey waves. Discordant survey data
inclusion criteria employed across the three New Zealand Physical Activity Report Cards to date has further complicated the ability to
accurately monitor trends in active transportation in New Zealand children and youth.
    Moving forward, there needs to be a set of guidelines within and across countries on how the different methodological approaches
and available data sources for monitoring and promoting active transportation are handled. To date, reporting of inequities in active
transportation across time has been inconsistent. Adapting Report Card grading criteria to consider inequities would facilitate
consistent reporting and increase knowledge in this area. In addition, researchers working closely with national organisations on
survey development are encouraged to address the issues of survey frequency and differences in terms, definitions (including treatment
of mixed transport modes), measurement, and thresholds of what constitutes active transportation. Consistent data inclusion criteria
and methodological approaches are needed for future New Zealand Physical Activity Report Cards. Nonetheless, the inclusion of
multiple datasets to date has enabled a broad, overarching assessment of active transportation in young New Zealanders that can be
used to inform future policy and investment in this area.
