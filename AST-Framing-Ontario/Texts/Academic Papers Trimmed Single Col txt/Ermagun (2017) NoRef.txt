    school trip information of 3441 middle and high school students in
    Tehran. We show a 1% increase in home-to-school distance reduces
    physical activity by 0.91%. Considering public transit a solely non-
    active mode, this reduction equals 2.21%. Therefore, ignoring the
    ‘quasi-active’ role of public transit overestimates the physical activ-
    ity reduction of students by 142%. We also indicate a 1% decrease in
    access to transit stations diminishes physical activity by 0.04%. This
    diminution is 0.02% when we apply the nested logit model. This is
    the direct consequence of ignoring the active component of public
    transit trips.
1. Introduction
The recent epidemic of physical inactivity among children has raised concerns about the
potential public health consequences. A study in the USA showed that the prevalence of
obesity had increased around 13% among persons aged 6–19 between 1999 and 2004
(Ogden et al. 2006). Physical inactivity enhances the risk of common diseases including
obesity, myocardial infarction, stroke, type II diabetes, cancer, hypertension, depression,
osteoarthritis, and asthma (Ebbeling, Pawlak, and Ludwig 2002). Studies reveal a significant
health gain for children who obtain 60 min of moderate daily physical activity (Salmon and
Timperio 2007). In part, these recommended levels of physical activity may be realized by
walking or biking to school.
    Apart from the active travel modes, public transit is an opportunity to accomplish a por-
tion of the recommended daily physical activity (Bopp, Gayah, and Campbell 2015). Besser
and Dannenberg (2005) studied 3312 transit users extracted from the 2001 National House-
hold Travel Survey, and found public transit users spend a median of 19 min daily walking
to and from transit. They also showed 29% of transit users achieve more than 30 min of

                                                     TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE        25
physical activity each day by walking to and from transit. Edwards (2008) assessed the net
increase in walking associated with taking public transit by applying a Tobit model on a
28,771-person sample of 2001 National Household Transport Survey. The results showed
that taking public transit is associated with 8–10 additional minutes of walking per day. In
2009, Lachapelle and Frank (2009) employed a multinomial logit (MNL) model to explore
the interdependency of public transit and physical activity in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia.
Controlling for socio-demographics and urban form characteristics, they found a positive
correlation between taking public transit, walking, and moderate physical activity. MacDon-
ald et al. (2010) conducted a pre–post analysis to explore the impact of light rail transit (LRT)
on body mass index (BMI) and physical activity in North Carolina. The final results demon-
strated that the use of LRT is associated with an average BMI reduction of 1.18 points. A
more comprehensive review of the literature in regard to the association between public
transit and physical activity is available in previous research (De Nazelle et al. 2011; Rissel
et al. 2012; Sallis et al. 2012).
    The relationship between public transit and physical activity stems from the idea that
public transit trips consist of active travel modes for users who walk and bike for the access
and egress portions of their trips. Public transit is neither solely active nor solely non-active.
Rather, we believe public transit is best described as a ‘quasi-active’ travel mode that has
both characteristics of active and non-active modes.
    This is not the first time public transit has been looked at as a combined mode of travel.
Studies have considered public transit as a combined travel mode, as walking, biking, park
and ride, and kiss and ride trips are typically part of public transit trips. In 2010, for instance,
Bekhor and Shiftan (2010) employed a series of models (MNL, nested logit (NL), cross-nested
logit (CNL), and kernel logit) to study effective factors on changing individuals’ mode from
private car to combined alternatives such as park and ride and public transportation in work
trips in Tel Aviv. They found that to avoid the model misspecification issue, park and ride,
a combined transportation mode, should be investigated in a CNL structure. To the best
of the authors’ knowledge, this has been the only study where the public transit mode is
utilized as a combined mode in a CNL framework.
    Previous studies employed descriptive analysis to understand the portion of walking
and physical activity in public transit trips. None of the previous studies considered public
transit as a ‘quasi-active’ mode in their model structures. Instead, public transit is typi-
cally considered in the category of non-active or motorized travel mode. Understanding
the quantitative component of public transit in active and non-active categories reveals
information on how active modes of transport can be promoted in routine trips. This
paper begins to study this research question by considering public transit in both active
and non-active nests in a two-level CNL framework. We use the school trip information of
3272 middle and high school students in Tehran for this analysis. This study extends previ-
ous research on school trips of students in Tehran (Samimi and Ermagun 2012; Ermagun,
Rashidi, and Samimi 2015a; Ermagun and Samimi 2015).
    The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows. We provide information on Tehran in
the following section. We then discuss the survey method and descriptive analysis. This is
followed by the modeling methodology section. We explore the influential parameters on
mode choice for school trips in the results section. We also examine the model misspecifi-
cation resulting from ignoring the active component of public transit trips in the sensitivity

analysis section. Finally, we end the paper with concluding remarks and suggestions for
future studies.
2. Study region
Tehran, with an area of around 700 km2 and a population of over 8 million in 22 municipal-
ities, is among the most densely populated cities in the world. The modal split for all daily
trips is: 28% private car, 22% bus, 10% subway, 10% mini-bus, 23% taxi, and 7% walking
and cycling (Allen 2013). The daily average travel time is 25 min and the daily travel speed
is 27.2 km/h. On average, trips by public transit take 15.5 min, and the average travel speed
for public transit is 24 km/h (Mohammad-Beigi, Nouri, and Liaghati 2015).
    By 2010, 125 km of subway line had been built, serving 70 stations and carrying nearly 3
million passengers daily. The subway consists of 5 main lines, and the headway fluctuates
from 3 to 15 min, depending on the line. However, there is not any regular headway for the
public bus system. The Bus Rapid Transit system has about 83 km dedicated paths. Approx-
imately 112 km of bike paths had been created by 2011. By 2013, this number had grown
to 285 km.
    In Tehran, like many other congested cities around the world, policies such as increasing
parking cost, increasing fuel cost, odd–even rationing, and cordon pricing are imposed to
control and reduce the number of private cars in particular regions of the city. There are
two types of limited traffic zones: (1) restricted zones based on odd and even days between
6:30 am and 7 pm and (2) central restricted zones between 6:30 am and 5 pm. These zones
are open for public vehicles such as buses, taxis, and ambulances.
    Tehran hosts more than 1 million elementary, middle, and high school students (Tehran
Census 2006). There are fewer than 1200 middle schools, and more than 1000 high schools,
41% of which are private. Public schools have a standard criterion that students should live
within a reasonable walking distance to school. This distance varies from zone to zone and
is determined by the Tehran Department of Education. However, private schools are not
compelled to abide by this rule. There are 566,331 middle and high school students in the
city of Tehran (Ministry of Education 2011). According to Islamic Governmental regulations,
schools are gender segregated. Female students make up 43% of the middle school stu-
dents and 53% of the high school students (Ministry of Education 2011). A staggering 27%
of all the 13 million daily trips are educational (Tehran Census 2006).
    School busing in Tehran is considered by residents to be an expensive mode of travel
and, unlike in many Western countries, is neither state provided nor free. Rather, it is a
chartered service using mini-buses, minivans, or private cars that provide door-to-door ser-
vices. To avoid confusion in the definition, we use ‘school service’ in reference to school
busing in Tehran. Both private and public schools register this school transport service at
the request of parents, and parents pay for this service for one school year. The cost of the
service depends on the distance to the school.
3. Survey method
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in May 2011 among 4700 middle and high school
students in Tehran. To identify problematic questionnaire designs, unclear questions, and
to obtain an initial estimate of the response rate, response bias, and survey cost, a pilot
survey was conducted in November 2010. For the pilot survey, 500 students from 2 high

                                                    TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE      27
schools and 2 middle schools were randomly selected in Tehran, from which 341 com-
pleted questionnaires were received. Dillman (2000) found this sample size adequate for
pilot studies. In accordance with recommendations in former studies (McMillan 2007), par-
ents were asked to fill out the questionnaires and send it back to the school. The pilot survey
included 12 questions on socioeconomic and transportation information. Many parents
ignored open-ended questions regarding family income, occupation of the family head,
and the reasons behind choice of transportation mode. Therefore, such questions were
altered with close-ended questions, based on the recommendations of Lazarsfeld (1944).
    The final questionnaire had 19 questions divided into 2 sections. The first section con-
tained socioeconomic and demographic questions, such as number of children, level of
education, car ownership, number of driver licenses in the household, occupation, and
income. The second section included trip information questions such as travel modes to
and from school, parents’ priorities in choosing a mode, walking time to school, and trans-
portation cost. One hundred cash prizes, ranging from 15 to 50 US dollars, were offered to
randomly selected students whose parents completed all the questions. Although financial
incentives could distort the response behavior, some studies have argued that money gen-
erally works better than other incentives for students of this age group (Kalfs and Van Evert
2003).
    The questionnaires were distributed in May 2011 to avoid any conflict with the students’
academic breaks and final exams based upon a stratified sampling. The stratified random
sampling was based on a gender, level of education, and traffic analysis zone among boys
and girls only schools. Survey envelopes were delivered to each school, and a school official
was placed in charge of distributing them among students. Parents were asked to com-
plete the questionnaire and send it back to the school. Out of 4700 envelopes that were
distributed in 94 schools, 76% were returned. An initial screening excluded 131 envelopes
from two schools, because evidence was found that parents did not fill them out. Overall,
the response rate of 73% was obtained, which includes 3441 questionnaires. This rate is
generally defined as the ratio of the number of completed questionnaires over the total
number of eligible participants (Richardson and Meyburg 2003). We also calculated the
minimum response rate (RR1) of 64%, in accordance with American Association of Public
Opinion Research (2006). This rate of response is deemed satisfactory for this type of study
(Schutt 2011).
4. Descriptive analysis
From the survey analysis, approximately 60% of the collected forms were from the pub-
lic schools, which is fairly compatible with the actual share of 59% for the public middle
and high schools in Tehran. All-girls schools have a share of 59.7% and 50.5% in the sam-
ple and population, respectively. High schools have a share of 40.5%, of which 58% are
from the all-girls schools. This can, arguably, be attributed to a higher level of responsibility
among females (Arlow 1991). The lowest rate of response was observed for the occupation
question, for which 10% of the parents refused to answer. Only 43 individuals refused the
questions about household income, and 24 refused the question about the number of cars
in the household.
    From the travel behavior analysis, 42.3% of students use walking on their way to school.
For the return trips this number rises to 48.9%. As shown in Table 1, 26.8% of girls walk

to school and 30.7% of girls walk home from school. This percentage is significantly lower
for boys. The imbalance might be explained by cultural and behavioral characteristics of
Iranian families, in which girls are more restricted than boys in outdoor activities. As a result,
girls find the school trips as an opportunity to socialize with their friends outside of school.
Almost one-third of parents drive solely to drop off their children at school, while 35% of
parents form a trip chain on their way to work. For return trips, 38% of parents drive just to
pick up their children, and 16% of them pick the children up on the way home from work.
In Tehran, girl students are not permitted to ride bikes and motorbikes in school trips for
religious and ideological reasons. Hence, the share of biking equals zero for girls in school
trips. The total share of biking is 1.3% due to the lack of integrated bike lanes when the
survey was conducted. We excluded biking from the data for further analysis because of
the low share in the travel modes. Public modes of transportation such as bus, subway, or
taxi are used by 14.6% of students to school, and 15.7% of students from school.
5. Modeling methodology
5.1. CNL model
The logit family (MNL, NL, CNL, and mixed) has the merit of a closed-form formulation,
which eases the estimation process (Train 2009). The MNL model is usually criticized for the
Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) property of unobserved random error terms,
which triggers constraints in some choice situations (Train 2009). As per the IIA property,
if a private vehicle user is unable to drive for any reason, the probability of choosing other
available travel modes will increase evenly. While in reality, the reasons that persuade this
person to drive, say distance to destination, may increase the probability of choosing public
transit more than walking or biking. Applying an MNL model in this situation causes model
misspecification.
    To remedy the IIA assumptions, NL and CNL models were developed, which remove the
IIA property from alternatives to nests. In the NL models, alternatives with correlated error
terms are embedded in a nest. A CNL model allows for alternatives located at more than
one nest when it shares its correlation with alternatives of various nests. This model was
employed for the first time by Small (1987) to investigate the departure time of travel. Then,

                                                          TRANSPORTMETRICA A: TRANSPORT SCIENCE  29
Vovsha (1997) named the model CNL and utilized it to scrutinize the park and ride mode of
travel as both public and private modes.
   The probability of choosing alternative i from nest n is derived by multiplying the prob-
ability of selecting the nest (Pn ) by conditional probability of choosing alternative i (Pi|n ) as
per Equation (1). In this equation, (Vi ) is the utility that perceives from travel mode i, µ rep-
resents the inverse logsum parameter or inclusive value (IV), a in stands for the portion of
alternative i, which is assigned to the sub-nest n, and t n is given by Equation (2).

5.2. Model structure and estimation
To quantify the role of public transit as a ‘quasi-active’ travel mode, we use a two-level CNL
model. We consider four modes of travel, including private car, school service, public transit,
and walking. Figure 1 shows the proposed tree structure, which has the better fit among
other possible structures. As shown, the upper level has two limbs that split into active and
non-active limbs. To quantify the active portion of the public transit mode, this mode is
considered in both the active and non-active nests. The IV parameters are determined in
the estimation procedure. In a two-level CNL, the IV parameters should be positive and less
than one (Wen and Koppelman 2001).
   We depicted the definition of explanatory variables used in the models in Table 2. We
also outlined the estimation results for MNL, NL, and CNL models in Table 3. The IV param-
eters of the non-active and active limbs in the CNL model are 0.76 and 0.62, respectively.
Both the IV parameters are statistically positive and less than one, according to a Wald and
student’s t-test. As the model specification shows, public transit needs to be considered as a
‘quasi-active’ mode of travel in the modeling framework for two reasons. First, the IV param-
eters of the active and non-active limbs are statistically between 0 and 1. It indicates that the

CNL model, which encompasses public transit mode in both active and non-active nests, is
a stable structure. Second, the overall fit of the CNL model is better than both MNL and NL
models by about 26% and 15%, respectively. It implies that the proposed CNL model cap-
tures more realistic characteristics of the system. All the variables are significant at a more
than 90% confidence interval, and have the expected sign. Allocation coefficients of public
transit for the non-active and active nests equal 0.47 and 0.53, respectively. In other words,
53% of the public transit utility plays a role in the active nest, while 47% is allocated in the
non-active nest. The following section represents the discussion on impact of parameters
on mode choice.
6. Results
We analyze influential parameters on travel modes, particularly, walking and public transit
in school trips. The variables are divided into three main categories: (1) household charac-
teristics, (2) urban and transportation system characteristics, and (3) parental concerns. The
results are based on the final CNL model.
6.1. Household characteristics
Age and gender of the students, household income, parental employment status, and edu-
cational level of parents are found significant in the final model. In accordance with previous
studies (Leslie et al. 2010; Ermagun, Rashidi, and Lari 2015b), girls are more likely to walk
than boys in school trips in Tehran. Boys are more likely to take public transit rather than
take the school service or private car. The results also show the positive correlation between

age of students and both walking and taking public transit. Families with higher incomes
are more likely to use private car and school service. Educational level of parents has a neg-
ative correlation with using public transit and walking modes. To wit, parents with higher
level of education are less likely to select public transportation and walking for their chil-
dren. The relationship between income and household level of education is a reason behind
this preference, as educated parents are more able to either afford the cost of a school
service or use private car.
6.2. Transport system and urban characteristics
We found distance from home to school, access to public transport stations, population
density, and student’s school location in limited traffic zones significant in the final model.

32         A. ERMAGUN AND D. LEVINSON
An increase in the home-to-school distance reduces the probability of walking, which is in
line with Western observations (Woldeamanuel 2016). The results also show the probability
of choosing public transit mode is reduced by decreasing access to transit stations. Hence,
long-term urban policies, such as school siting and public transit station locations, affect
mode choice.
   We found that with increasing population density, use of walking and public transit
increases in school trips. This is rooted in three main reasons. First, the increased popula-
tion density means increased residential units in the area, and increased eyes on the street,
which reduces parental concerns for safety of their children. Second, high population den-
sity is a feature of areas with small residential units, and in Tehran such a structure generally
indicates low-income residents. Third, dense places are usually more walkable because of
the diversity of land uses and favorable street network characteristics (Saelens and Handy
2008). Restricted Traffic Zones have a negative correlation with private car use. In Tehran,
the share of low-income household regions in Restricted Traffic Zones is significantly more
than high-income households because of the urban structure. Therefore, the low use of
private cars in these regions is not surprising.
6.3. Parental concerns
We assessed the influence of parental attitudes toward safety, comfort, travel reliability,
and travel duration of various modes of travel on mode choice decision. Confirming with
previous studies (Deka and Von Hagen 2015; Ermagun and Samimi 2016), our results indi-
cate parents who are concerned about the safety of their children are less likely to allow
their children to use public transport or walking to school. Therefore, implementing pro-
grams like ‘safe routes to school’ and the ‘walking school bus’ may promote active and
public modes of travel in Tehran. As expected, the results indicate that parents who pre-
fer to use school service and private car are considering the comfort of their children. Also,
parents who are concerned about the reliability of the mode of transport prefer to use the
school service. Considering this, it could be said that the lack of regular schedule for public
transport in Tehran, particularly buses, discourages its use for school trips.
7. Sensitivity analysis
Table 4 shows the elasticity of continuous variables for the MNL, NL, and CNL models. The
results of the CNL model suggest that for people who choose walking, an increase of 1% in
home-to-school distance reduces the probability of walking by 3.51%. This reduction was
found to be significantly lower in the MNL and NL models, which is a direct consequence
of the model misspecification that misrepresents the effect of distance. A 1% increase in
the home-to-school distance diminishes the probability of taking public transit by 1.04%
among public transit users, while it increases the probability of shifting to public transit from
walking by 1.39%. The elasticity results of the CNL model indicate that with a 1% increase in
the household income level of school service and private car users, the probability of choos-
ing public transit diminishes by 0.23% and 0.14%, respectively. Further, a 1% increase in the
residential population density increases the probability of walking by 0.17%, followed by
0.17% reduction in using public transit. Access to transit stations is another pivotal variable
that has a positive correlation with public transit use, and consequently increases the level

of physical activity among children. Although access to transit has been studied in previ-
ous research, little is known about how much accessibility to transit may affect the utility of
public transit in school trips. The elasticity of WALKTRNT variable shows the probability of
taking public transit is reduced by 0.29% when access to transit is diminished by 1%. As a
result, the probability of private car and school service increases equally by 0.04%. The NL
model misrepresents this growth twice as much as the CNL model.
    Among the travel mode specific characteristics, the cost of private car and school ser-
vice are found significant in the final model. Studies emphasize that taste variations of
people affects their decision-making behavior (Train 2009). For instance, people with dif-
ferent income levels behave in a different way toward the changes in cost of transportation
modes. As a result, considering the same responses for all of them may lead to inappropri-
ate policies. To accommodate the alternative taste variations, the cost of private cars and
school service use is normalized by the household income level. A 1% increase in the cost
of private car travel reduces the probability of choosing private car by 0.40%, and thereby
people shift to public transit and walking by a probability of 0.11% and 0.08%, respectively.
However, this reduction varies considerably, depending on level of income. While the rate
of reduction is 0.40% among low-income families, the probability of selecting private car
diminishes by only 0.20% among high-income families.
    One of the main aims of this study is to indicate how much the consideration of public
transit as a ‘quasi-active’ mode affects describing active modes of travel. Table 5 illustrates
the elasticity of choosing active and non-active nests in the NL and CNL models for policy
sensitive variables. Without considering public transit as a ‘quasi-active’ mode, the probabil-
ity of choosing an active nest decreases by 2.2% following a 1% increase in home-to-school
distance. With considering public transit as a ‘quasi-active’ mode this reduction is about
0.91%. This is due to the shifting of a significant proportion of walkers to public transit
by increasing the home-to-school distance. A 1% increase of the distance to public transit
decreases the probability of students’ physical activity by approximately 0.04%. The CNL
model, by considering public transit mode as a ‘quasi-active’ mode, expresses that the

probability of a student being active increases about 0.02%. This difference in not only
magnitude but in sign is a direct consequence of model misspecification. Ignoring the
active side of public transit can easily result in wrong policies to be presented by those
who are seeking to promote walking mode of travel. According to the CNL model, the elas-
ticity results of AUT_N_COST and SS_N_COST variables show that a 1% increase in the ratio
of private car and school service cost to household’s income increases the probability of
being active for students by 0.04% and 0.12%, respectively. Such results not only give more
awareness to politicians in order to reduce the use of private car, but they also are effective
in improving physical activity and public health.
8. Conclusion
This study quantified the active travel component of the public transit mode for journeys
to school by applying a two-level CNL model in Tehran. Much of the previous research has
been limited to descriptive analysis for quantifying the active component of public transit
by the complexity associated with advanced econometrics models. This paper overcomes
this challenge by applying a two-level CNL model. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
this study is the first attempt to develop such a tree decision structure and scrutinize
the public transit mode as both active and non-active mode of travel in a simultaneous
framework.
    From a substantive viewpoint, the model structure embodies the philosophy that public
transit is a ‘quasi-active’ mode of travel and, as evidenced by the findings of this research,
should be modeled in a cross-nest structure for mode choice decisions. Model estima-
tion results highlight the need to deem public transit as a ‘quasi-active’ mode of travel for
two main reasons: (1) the better fit than both MNL and NL models and (2) the stability of
tree structure as per the IV parameters. Developing such a model structure constitutes an
important step forward in understanding the active side of mode choice decisions.
    We found public transit provides an opportunity to accomplish part of the daily recom-
mended physical activity for children. It is typically known that increasing home-to-school
distance reduces the likelihood of children to walk, and thereby decreases the physical
activity of children. However, a portion of this reduction shifts to public transit. Acknowl-
edging the ‘quasi-active’ role of public transit, this shift helps to alleviate the assumed
reduction in the physical activity of children. Concretely speaking, we showed 1% increase
in home-to-school distance reduces physical activity by 0.91%. Building on the traditional
models, which consider public transit a solely non-active mode, this reduction equals
2.21%. Therefore, ignoring the ‘quasi-active’ role of public transit overestimates the physical
activity reduction of students by 142%. The model explicitly incorporates a number of

influential parameters that affect active modes of travel for a physically active lifestyle.
These include household characteristics, transport system and urban characteristics, and
parental concerns. To measure the amount of physical activity in a transportation network
accurately, it is essential to develop a framework that allows seeing both active and non-
active sides of travel modes. The findings of the model suggest that the home-to-school
distance, cost of travel, access distance to transit stations, and safety are more sensitive
variables in choosing walking and taking public transit. While this research offers some
insights into the role of public transit in active travel, it yet has room to improve with further
research:
• We overlooked the effects of built environment and transit system information in our
    model, as they were not publicly available for Tehran.
• We studied the school travel behavior of children older than 12, due to the lack of data.
    We recommend comparing the travel behavior of children younger than 12 with older
    than 12 using the proposed modeling framework.
• As we discussed, ‘school bus’ in Tehran is a door-to-door service, unlike the school bus
    in Western countries that typically includes walking for the access. We hence recom-
    mend testing school bus as a quasi-active mode of travel akin to public transit in a CNL
    framework.
