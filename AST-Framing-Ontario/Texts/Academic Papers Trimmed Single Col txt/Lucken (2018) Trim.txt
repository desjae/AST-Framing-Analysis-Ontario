The percentage of students walking or biking to school in the United States has fallen drastically over the past decades. This decline has important
implications for children’s health, as walking and biking to school result in health bene<U+FB01>ts, including more physical activity and lower risk of
obesity. In<U+FB02>uencing parents to consider active transportation to school (ATS) is a necessary step in behavior change. Our research examines the
impact of providing parents with information about the health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts of ATS on parent perception of ATS feasibility. Parents given
information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts were hypothesized to perceive ATS as more feasible, as measured by responding that there is an additional morning
or afternoon during the week when their child could walk or bike to or from school. Treatment and control surveys were distributed to parents with
children attending elementary school in Alameda County and Richmond, California. Discrete choice models developed from this data indicated that
information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts did not have a signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on parent perception of ATS feasibility. The two models provided further insight into
ATS behavior and parent perception of ATS feasibility. Greater walk time to school, higher parent education levels, lack of sidewalks along the route
to school, and child participation in after-school activities located outside the school campus decreased perception of ATS feasibility. Walk time to
school, vehicle ownership, and lack of sidewalks decreased ATS behavior, while having an adult in the home with <U+FB02>exible work hours increased it.
Minorities were less likely to participate in ATS every day. Based on these results, providing more after-school activities on school grounds,
constructing sidewalks along routes to school, and locating schools in dense, mixed-use areas are supported as strategies to increase ATS behavior.




1. Introduction

    Since 1969, the percentage of kindergarten through 8th grade students biking or walking to school in the United States has fallen
from 47.7% to 12.7% (McDonald et al., 2011a). This change has serious implications for children’s health, as walking and biking to
school result in health bene<U+FB01>ts, including more physical activity and lower risk of obesity (Larouche et al., 2014). Moreover, school
travel now accounts for 5-7% of vehicle miles traveled and 10-14% of private vehicles on the road during morning peak hours
(McDonald et al., 2011a). Encouraging active transportation to school (ATS) thus has the potential to improve children’s health,
lower the greenhouse gas emissions associated with school travel, and reduce tra<U+FB03>c during peak hours. Research also indicates that
children who walk or bike are more likely to consider active modes as adults, suggesting the potential for additional environmental
and health bene<U+FB01>ts in the future (Black et al., 2001). However, many factors prevent children from walking or biking to school. Eight
main barriers have been identi<U+FB01>ed: distance to school, parental fear of tra<U+FB03>c and crime, family schedule constraints and values,
neighborhood and family resources and culture, weather, and school characteristics (Stewart et al., 2012). This study targets “family
schedule constraints and values.” It seeks to identify whether providing parents with information about the impacts of ATS on
children’s health and academic performance a<U+FB00>ects parent perception of the feasibility of their children walking or biking to school,

whether accompanied or alone. The results could impact strategies ATS programs such as Safe Routes to Schools (SRTS) use to
increase the number of children walking or biking to school.
    The following sections provide further background, research objectives and hypotheses, methodology, results, policy and equity
implications, and study limitations, before concluding with <U+FB01>nal policy recommendations and suggestions for future research.

1.1. Background

    Various research supports a wide range of health, environmental, and equity bene<U+FB01>ts from supporting ATS. Walking and biking to
school result in health bene<U+FB01>ts for children, including more physical activity, lower risk of obesity, more positive emotions, and less
stress (Carver et al., 2010; Faulkner et al., 2009; Hodgson et al., 2012; Hosking et al. 2011; Larouche et. al., 2014; Lee et al., 2008;
Martin et al., 2016; Pooley et al., 2010; Ramanathan et al., 2014; Tudor-Locke et al., 2001; Waygood et al., 2017; Westman et al.,
2013). Furthermore, partaking in physical activity is positively associated with academic performance in young people and can
in<U+FB02>uence brain structure and cognitive performance (Dijk et al., 2014; Singh, 2012). ATS has positive climate impacts, too, because as
more people walk and bike in the mornings, fewer cars are on the road, resulting in decreased tra<U+FB03>c congestion and greenhouse gas
emissions (Bearman and Singleton, 2014; Marshall et al., 2010; Rome, 2011; Singleton, 2014; Wilson et al., 2007). Finally, ATS
interventions can also improve equity, as research suggests that investing in walk and bike infrastructure near schools reduces
transportation expenses for families (McDonald et al., 2016).
    The SRTS program has aimed to promote ATS since Congress incorporated it into the 2005 federal transportation bill SAFETEA-
LU, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, E<U+FB03>cient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (McDonald and Aalborg, 2009). A meta-
analysis by McDonald et al. (2014) tracked 801 schools from 2007 to 2012 and determined that after schools participated in the
program for <U+FB01>ve years, the proportion of students walking and bicycling to school increased by 31%, on average. Many other studies
have also shown that SRTS projects, interventions, and funding increase the likelihood of walking and biking to school (Boarnet et al.,
2005a, 2005b; Carlin et al., 2016; Hoelscher et al., 2016; McDonald et al., 2013, 2014). Types of SRTS interventions include physical
changes, such as tra<U+FB03>c calming, crosswalks, sidewalks, separate bicycle lanes/cycle tracks, and school placement in dense neigh-
borhoods (McDonald, 2010a). Other SRTS interventions are legislative, dealing with school policies encouraging ATS (Chriqui et al.,
2012); organizational, including walking school buses, walk or bike to school days, and crossing guards (Mendoza et al., 2011, 2012);
and educational, such as creating a school culture that informs students and/or parents about the bene<U+FB01>ts of ATS through curriculum,
family activities, and newsletters (McKee et al., 2007; Villa-González et al., 2017). In this study, providing information on ATS
bene<U+FB01>ts was chosen as a low-cost intervention that could be implemented on a large scale. While the main aim of this research was to
examine the impact of an educational intervention, our results suggest bene<U+FB01>ts from several of the intervention categories just
described.
    SRTS program evaluation is based on student and parent surveys; information about the reliability of these surveys has im-
plications for the accuracy of our own survey-based study. McDonald et al. (2011b) examined test-retest reliability between a SRTS
parent travel survey that was sent home with the student and returned to the teacher and a follow-up survey mailed to the parents
two weeks later. The researchers found high reliability on questions about travel mode, travel time, education, and income (objective
questions), but more variability in yes/no questions pertaining to parent attitudes and barriers to modes of travel (subjective
questions) (McDonald et al., 2011b). In our survey design, we attempted to improve upon the variability of yes/no questions by
allowing respondents to select their top three perceived barriers to ATS.
    Of great relevance to our study, there has been substantial research on parents’ decisions to drive their children to school even
short distances. Studying children between the ages of 10 and 14 in Oakland, Berkeley, Albany, and Richmond, CA zip codes,
McDonald and Aalborg (2009) used data collected from telephone surveys to investigate parents’ reasoning for driving their children
to school. 75% percent of parents driving their children less than 2 miles to school cited convenience as a reason, primarily in terms of
the “time advantage of driving over walking.” Indeed, time constraints are signi<U+FB01>cant ATS predictors for parents (Weigand and
McDonald, 2011). Evidence also suggests that parental attitudes about active modes play an important role in ATS behavior, as
children are more likely to walk and bicycle to school if their parents value their children’s physical activity (Davison et al., 2008). To
support a comprehensive model for school travel mode choice, McMillan (2005) introduced a conceptual framework in which ATS
behavior is determined by urban form, real and perceived neighborhood and tra<U+FB03>c safety, household transportation options, so-
ciodemographics, social/cultural norms, and parental attitudes. Mitra (2013) extended McMillan’s proposed framework by including
the policy context, natural environment, child’s attitudes and physical/cognitive development, and household schedule constraints as
additional factors in school travel mode choice. Within this framework, our research targets the interaction between parental atti-
tudes and time constraints in ATS behavior. It examines whether increasing parents’ perception of health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts from
ATS decreases their sense that time constraints prevent their children from participating in ATS, by inducing a reprioritization of ATS
in their schedules.

1.2. Research objectives and hypotheses

   Determining the e<U+FB00>ect of providing parents with information about the health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts of ATS could support this
approach as a low-cost strategy to encourage walking and biking to school. Speci<U+FB01>cally, we asked parents, “Is there a single additional
morning or afternoon during the week when your child(ren) could walk or bike to or from their elementary school (accompanied or
alone)?” For the treatment group, we provided a paragraph about the health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts of ATS before asking this
question. We followed this question with a set of queries about the respondent’s characteristics, including socioeconomic information,

                                                                    29

E. Lucken et al.                                                                                 Journal of Transport & Health 10 (2018) 28–36


current school commute modes, distance from school, availability of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure along the route to school,
and perceived barriers to ATS.
    The treatment group was hypothesized to yield a higher percentage of parents responding that they have an additional morning or
afternoon for ATS. This hypothesis hinged on the idea that parents’ perceptions about ATS feasibility can be in<U+FB02>uenced with new
information. After learning about their children’s potential health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts from walking or biking to school even once
per week, parents were expected to prioritize ATS in their schedules at a higher rate. This study measured momentary changes in
parents’ priorities rather than actually asking parents to complete ATS, thereby targeting the e<U+FB00>ect of the intervention on early stages
of behavior change (Prochaska and DiClemente, 1986). Prochaska and DiClemente’s Transtheoretical Model of behavior change
(TTM) proposes that people changing a behavior move through stages, including “pre-contemplation,” “contemplation,” “prepara-
tion,” “action,” and “maintenance,” and that interventions should target a person’s current stage to most successfully move them
through the transition to behavior change. Both the control and treatment surveys caused parents to at least momentarily consider
what ATS might involve, because answering questions about distance to school, availability of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure
along the route, and potential times to complete ATS led parents to visualize the route they would take with their children and when.
With respect to the hypothesized additional impact from providing information on ATS bene<U+FB01>ts in the treatment survey, Waygood
et al. (2012) discuss how presenting information on new travel modes can cause people to move from “pre-contemplation” to
“contemplation” of mode change by helping them understand the bene<U+FB01>ts and drawbacks of the switch. Bamberg (2014) also sug-
gests that, while positive information about alternatives may not be su<U+FB03>cient to change behavior, it can support deliberate decision-
making. Accordingly, parents provided with information about ATS health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts were expected to more carefully
consider potential modi<U+FB01>cations to their schedule that would make occasional ATS possible, thus more fully shifting to “con-
templating” ATS than parents who did not receive the information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts.
    TTM has been criticized for lack of evidence that interventions targeted to the proposed stages are more successful at changing
behavior than non-targeted interventions, or that moving people from one early stage to the next increases the likelihood of behavior
change (West, 2005, 2006). However, the critique agrees that “individuals who are thinking of changing their behavior are more
likely to try to do so than those who are not” and that “people who try to do something are more likely to succeed than those who do
not” (West, 2005). It also recommends that interventions aim to shift individuals’ “moment-to-moment balance of motives” to
consistently favor the desired alternative behavior. Borrowing the TTM language of “pre-contemplation” and “contemplation” in this
study simply helps to convey the intervention’s desired e<U+FB00>ect of causing parents to consider trying ATS, while the research itself
actually measures the e<U+FB00>ectiveness of bene<U+FB01>cial information about ATS in shifting this “moment-to-moment balance of motives” in
schedule prioritization.

2. Methodology

    The data required to complete this study come from surveys distributed to parents with children in elementary school in Alameda
County and the City of Richmond, California, which are situated on the east side of the San Francisco Bay across from San Francisco.
41 elementary school Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) were selected for outreach based on the schools’ socioeconomic diversity,
terrain conducive to walking and biking, and geographic diversity within the East Bay. This was done to increase the heterogeneity of
respondents so the models would be informed by a rich dataset. We also hoped this would allow an analysis of equity with regard to
ATS behavior and perceptions, for ATS behavior has been shown to di<U+FB00>er across income and ethnicity groups (Babey et al., 2009).
    The web-based survey was o<U+FB00>ered in English and Spanish and was distributed using Qualtrics. Surveys in both languages were
pretested by numerous individuals to ensure comprehension and ease of use. Two schools were provided with paper surveys upon
request. The survey was advertised by contacting PTAs that then distributed the survey via their member email lists. Besides in-
dividual school PTAs, umbrella PTA organizations such as the Peralta District PTA were contacted, and they then distributed the web-
based survey to their constituent elementary school PTAs. When parents visited the survey link, they were randomly assigned to the
treatment or control group. The information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts was provided as a treatment to approximately half of the survey
takers, while the control group was given the same survey without this information. Precautions were taken to ensure anonymity and
that any information leaked would pose minimal risk to the well-being of the parents and their children.
    To assess the e<U+FB00>ect of information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts on parent perceptions, we asked questions about the perceived feasibility of
children participating in additional ATS as well as about factors other than the bene<U+FB01>ts information that may in<U+FB02>uence this per-
ception. These factors included current school travel mode choice and the perceived barriers that hinder participation in ATS.
Sociodemographic data were obtained through questions on household income, ethnicity, parents’ education level, number and ages
of children in the household, presence of an adult with a <U+FB02>exible work schedule, and number of vehicles owned or leased, as these
factors were expected to in<U+FB02>uence mode choice to school and potential response to the treatment. Survey questions also asked about
travel time to school via several modes of transportation, perceived presence of walking and biking infrastructure on the route to and
from school, and participation in after-school activities on and o<U+FB00> the school campus. The complete survey is available from the
corresponding author upon request.
    Using the data collected from this survey, two discrete choice models were built to investigate school travel decisions and suggest
potential policies to support ATS. Discrete choice models describe choices between alternatives, with the characteristics of the
respondents and of the alternatives incorporated as indicators that drive these choices. These models determine the signi<U+FB01>cance of
several factors in<U+FB02>uencing parents’ school travel mode choice, such as household income or walk time to school. Discrete choice
models can also forecast growth or decline in participation of ATS through policy and infrastructure interventions, such as improved
walking facilities. Both models were built using a Python coding package called PyLogit (Brathwaite and Walker, 2016). All variables

                                                                  30

E. Lucken et al.                                                                                              Journal of Transport & Health 10 (2018) 28–36


included in the model were dummy variables, meaning they had a value of one if the characteristic was true for that respondent and a
value of zero if it was not true.
    The <U+FB01>rst model is a binary logit model, with the two choices being the parent perceiving that there was or was not an additional
morning or afternoon during the week when their child could walk or bike to or from school. All variables asked about in the survey
were tested in this model to determine whether they had a statistically signi<U+FB01>cant impact on parent perception of ATS feasibility.
Parents who reported that their children already walked or biked to and from school every morning and afternoon were excluded
from this model because it was not possible for them to <U+FB01>nd an additional time to participate in ATS.
    The second model is more general, as it focuses on the current frequency of ATS and does not depend on presence of the ATS
bene<U+FB01>ts statement. It is a multinomial logit model, with alternatives of participating in ATS every day, frequently (once or more per
week), infrequently (a few times a year or once a month), or never. While the ordered outcome variables could warrant the use of an
ordered logit or ordered probit model, we chose multinomial logit because our data did not support the proportional odds assumption
underlying the ordinal models. As with the <U+FB01>rst model, this multinomial logit model was built by testing all variables asked about in
the survey to see if they had a statistically signi<U+FB01>cant impact on the frequency with which parents allowed their children to perform
ATS. The results of these models and their policy implications are discussed in the following sections.

3. Results

     245 parents responded to the survey. 49 of these reported doing ATS every morning and afternoon, and were thus removed from
the data when creating the model that focused on parents’ perception of whether there was an additional morning or afternoon for
ATS. The small sample size raises concerns about response bias, especially as White and high-income families are overrepresented in
the sample. These problems are discussed further at the end of the results section and in the study limitations section of this article.
     The survey results were <U+FB01>rst analyzed to determine if the paragraph on ATS bene<U+FB01>ts impacted the number of parents responding
that there was an additional morning or afternoon during the week when their children could walk or bike to or from school.
Although a slightly larger portion of the treatment group reported that their children could participate in ATS an additional time (30
out of 72, compared to 45 out of 125 for the control group), the di<U+FB00>erence was not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (p-value of .20).
     The <U+FB01>rst model shows which attributes or characteristics in<U+FB02>uence parents’ likelihood of perceiving that their children have an
additional morning or afternoon during the week for ATS. The results for the <U+FB01>rst model are shown in Table 1. When the walk time to
school is 30 minutes or less, parents are more likely to perceive that there is an additional morning or afternoon for ATS. If both
parents have a bachelor’s or more advanced degree, parents are less likely to perceive additional ATS as feasible. These <U+FB01>ndings
match those of Larouche et al. (2015) that school travel time and parent education are negatively correlated with ATS behavior in the
United States. Finally, our model also shows the intuitive results that parents are less likely to perceive ATS as feasible if the route to
school lacks sidewalks or if their children participate in after-school activities somewhere other than at school.
     The baseline probability among our sample of perceiving that there is an additional morning or afternoon for ATS is 38%.
Plugging values from our sample into the model indicates that this probability would increase to 42% if all after-school activities were
moved to the school campus, to 44% if all families had sidewalks the entire length of the route to school, to 68% if walk time to school
fell to between 10 and 30 minutes for families that currently have walk times greater than 30 minutes, and to 76% if all families had
walk times to school of 10 minutes or less. Among the 35% of our sample whose children have o<U+FB00>-campus after-school activities, the
model predicts that shifting those activities to the school campus would increase their probability of perceiving that there is an

additional morning or afternoon for ATS from 30% to 41%. Of course, these predictions are only coarse approximations, as using the
model to estimate responses to policy interventions involves many assumptions, including that the relationships in the model remain
valid across a range of values for the independent variables and that the independent variables are uncorrelated.

how frequently people walk or bike to school with their child or allow their child to walk or bike to school on their own. The
alternatives in this model involve participating in ATS never, infrequently, frequently, and every day. The model results are shown in
Table 2. This model con<U+FB01>rms the a priori hypotheses in many ways. For example, sidewalk infrastructure and shorter walk times to
school are correlated with more frequent ATS behavior. Also, if there is a parent with <U+FB02>exible work hours in the household, the child

is more likely to participate in ATS every day. Interestingly, if the respondent cites weather as a barrier to ATS, their children are
more likely to participate in ATS frequently or every day. This may be because children often doing ATS are more likely to notice
weather as a factor that occasionally prevents them from walking or biking to school. Owning three or more vehicles, meanwhile,
increases the likelihood of participating in ATS infrequently as compared to never, frequently, or every day. This could stem from a
combination of social class and a<U+FB03>nity for driving; parents with three or more vehicles may be wealthier and thus more likely to
engage in occasional school-organized “walk-or-bike-to-school days,” as indicated by research showing that parent involvement in
elementary school events is correlated with income (Lee and Bowen, 2006). However, parents with three or more vehicles may also
have more a<U+FB03>nity for driving that leads them to drive their children to school the rest of the time. Unfortunately, we could not test
the signi<U+FB01>cance of owning no vehicles or one vehicle due to insu<U+FB03>cient representation of families with these characteristics in our
sample.
    Among our sample, the baseline probability of never doing ATS is 42%, doing ATS infrequently is 20%, frequently is 15%, and
every day is 22%. Plugging values from our sample into the model as before indicates that these probabilities would change to 32%,
28%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, if all families had sidewalks along the entire length of their routes. They would change to 23%,
34%, 19%, and 24% if walk time to school fell to between 10 and 30 minutes for families that currently have walk times greater than
30 minutes. Reducing walk time to school to ten minutes or less for all families in our sample would decrease the probability of never
doing ATS to 4% and that of infrequent ATS to 9%, while increasing the probability of frequent ATS to 25% and everyday ATS to
62%. Again, these estimated outcomes are only rough approximations.
    Factors that were not statistically signi<U+FB01>cant in either of the models were household income (the <U+FB01>rst and second models had p-
values of 0.58 and 0.17, respectively, for household incomes greater than 140K, and of 0.74 and 0.78 for 100K to 140K, with less than
100K as the reference variable); number of children (with one child as the reference variable, p-values of 0.21 and 0.43 for two
children and of 0.50 and 0.88 for three or more children); and perceiving terrain (0.40 and 0.75), child schedules (0.89 and 0.54),
parent schedules (0.28 and 0.30), or the need to carry things (0.76 and 0.69) as barriers to ATS. The references for this last set of
variables are not perceiving these factors as barriers. In this paragraph, the p-values listed for the second model are for participating
in ATS at all, with never participating in ATS as the base case. The lack of signi<U+FB01>cance for household income could be due to
insu<U+FB03>cient variation in this variable among our sample, as described in the following paragraph. Finally, while the structure of our
survey did not allow testing how ATS behavior varied with children’s age or grade level, this relationship is an important focus for
future research.
    The survey results were analyzed to determine if the sample was representative of the population of students attending school in
Richmond and Alameda County. White respondents were overrepresented in our sample, making up 51% of our sample but 19.5% of
the target population, while Hispanic and Black respondents were underrepresented, making up 4% and 2% of our sample but 34%
and 11% of the target population, respectively (Education Data Partnership, 2016). Other minority groups were also under-
represented, with Asians, Filipinos, and Native Hawaiian or Paci<U+FB01>c Islanders making up 16%, 0%, and 0% of the sample but 24%, 5%,
and 1.1% of the target population. Parents with household incomes over $140k were overrepresented in our sample, making up 56%
of those who reported income as opposed to about 31% in the target population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). All other income
brackets were underrepresented, especially those with household incomes between 30k and 60k and those making less than 30k,
which made up 5% and 1% of our sample but about 18% and 15% of the target population, respectively.
    Current commute patterns among respondents were analyzed to determine if they matched with that of the target population.
Respondents were allowed to select all the modes their children take to or from school during an average week, and many re-
spondents selected multiple modes. About 73% of respondents reported car as a frequent mode to and from school, while about 28%
reported walk as a frequent mode, about 12% reported bike, about 8% reported carpool, and about 4% reported bus. While frequency
of ATS behavior is not currently collected for the target population, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission reported that,
during the 2013-14 school year, 52% of Alameda County students reported riding in the family car to and from school, 30% reported
walking, 3% reported biking, 8% carpool, and 3% school bus (MTC, 2015). Our results appear roughly representative, as bicycle may
appear more often in our “frequent mode” data because it was allowed to be reported as one of many modes.

4. Discussion

    The two logit models were used to interpret potential policy and equity implications for promoting ATS. The results support other
studies’ <U+FB01>ndings that providing sidewalks along the route to school, o<U+FB00>ering walking school buses (WSBs), and enabling shorter walk
times to school through school siting practices and denser development would increase perception of ATS feasibility as well as actual
ATS behavior. This study also supports the novel intervention of increasing provision of after-school activities on the school campus
as a way to increase perception of ATS feasibility. The results further add to the literature in showing that providing parents with
information about the health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts of ATS did not a<U+FB00>ect perception of ATS feasibility. The <U+FB01>ndings depart from other
studies in that, after accounting for other factors, minorities were measured as less likely to participate in ATS every day. Each of
these results is discussed below.
    First, while the information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts was not found to have a signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on the proportion of parents who
perceived that there was an additional morning or afternoon for ATS, this does not mean that providing information about ATS
bene<U+FB01>ts is an ine<U+FB00>ective strategy to encourage ATS–nor is it evidence for or against the stages of behavior change model. Rather, it
indicates that providing parents with a short, written summary of ATS health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts does not shift the “moment-to-
moment balance of motives” underlying school travel decisions (West, 2005). Interventions involving provision of bene<U+FB01>ts in-
formation at a larger scale may successfully achieve this shift. For instance, perhaps communicating the bene<U+FB01>ts to parents in person

or having the information repeated by teachers, at PTA meetings, in school assemblies, and even by family pediatricians would have
led to a statistically signi<U+FB01>cant increase in parent perception of ATS feasibility, as suggested by McKee et al. (2007) and Villa-
Gonzalez et al. (2017). Our results do support several other interventions, as discussed below.
    Based on the results of the behavior model, providing more sidewalks along common routes to school would increase ATS
behavior, echoing the results of Boarnet et al. (2005a, 2005b). Among our sample, ensuring that all families have sidewalks along the
entire route to school would increase the probability of everyday, frequent, and infrequent ATS from 22% to 23%, 15% to 17%, and
20% to 28%, respectively, while reducing the probability of never doing ATS from 42% to 32%. The provision of sidewalks could also
be expanded to providing other amenities, such as crossing guards or signed and <U+FB02>ashing pedestrian crossings, to increase the
perceived and actual safety of ATS.
    The location of after-school activities is another factor that our model shows in<U+FB02>uences the perception of ATS feasibility. The <U+FB01>rst
model indicates that having after-school activities that are not on the school campus decreases parent perception of ATS feasibility.
Hence, planning more after-school activities to occur on or near campus could promote ATS. We could not <U+FB01>nd discussion of this
intervention in other research. Having more after-school activities located on campus means parents do not have to shuttle children
to di<U+FB00>erent sites, thus allowing for the option of active transportation from school to home after the activity has ended. The Oakland
Uni<U+FB01>ed School District (OUSD) is currently working with the California Department of Education and Oakland Fund for Children and
Youth Funding to provide after-school programs at schools, and there are already 42 elementary school OUSD after-school program
sites (OUSD, 2017). OUSD’s design and plan for after-school programs could be used as an e<U+FB00>ective guide for other school districts.
    Both models indicate that enabling shorter average distances and walk times to school would be the most e<U+FB00>ective way to increase
ATS in the long run. Promoting school placement in dense areas and increasing dense, mixed-use development around existing
schools would reduce average distance and travel time to and from school. As described in McDonald (2010), school siting practices
should support “community-centered” schools that are small in size, <U+FB01>t into the served neighborhood, and safe for children to access
by walk or bike. Local and regional land planners should work with school facility planners to ensure the provision of safe pedestrian
and bicycle infrastructure around school sites.
    A short-term solution that reduces walk time for parents are WSBs. WSBs consist of an adult walking with children along a known
route with pedestrian infrastructure to and from school. Parents can volunteer to trade o<U+FB00> days supervising the WSB or the school can
pay trained adults to <U+FB01>ll this role (Waygood et al., 2015). This intervention builds on our <U+FB01>nding that families are more likely to do
ATS every day when at least one adult in the home has <U+FB02>exible work hours. A WSB provides another adult to supervise children along
the walk to school and thus mimics the role of an adult in the home with <U+FB02>exible hours. WSBs have been shown to increase and
sustain ATS behavior and have also shown positive results for urban, low-income elementary school students (Mendoza et al., 2009,
2012). WSBs should be implemented in a 30-minute walk radius from schools to target families in this zone, which the models show
currently have an inclination to do ATS. This recommendation is consistent with research by McDonald and Aalborg (2009), which
estimated that WSBs could a<U+FB00>ect the behavior of 60% of parents who presently drive their children less than 2 miles to school.
    The short-term and long-term solutions presented in this paper must consider possible equity implications. While our model
indicates that minorities are less likely to do ATS every day (after accounting for other factors), this may be because Hispanic and
Black respondents were highly underrepresented in our sample. A consistent <U+FB01>nding in the ATS literature is that Hispanic and Black
students are more likely to walk or bike to school and to do so without safe commute infrastructure, such as sidewalks, lighting, or
marked crosswalks (McDonald, 2008; Royne et al., 2016). Those who actively commute are also more likely to be exposed to
violence, air pollution, and high tra<U+FB03>c levels (Pabayo et al., 2012; Pooley et al., 2010). Safe sidewalks and other pedestrian and
bicycle infrastructure should be provided in low-income and minority neighborhoods. After-school programs, especially those on the
school campus, should be fully funded or free to students from low-income families. WSBs and community-centered schools in low-
income and minority neighborhoods should aim to reduce the potential for unsafe commutes. Barriers to ATS for underserved
communities should be assessed through e<U+FB00>ective outreach, such as assistance programs or public meetings. The results from this
paper, and from assessment of local conditions, should be presented to local governments to encourage the development of policies
and bike/pedestrian plans that prioritize investment in low-income areas. Collaboration between schools, social justice groups, active
transportation programs, and local and regional jurisdictions will be necessary to address equity issues that arise in the development
of solutions that improve and encourage ATS.

4.1. Study limitations

    The study has several limitations regarding the use of a survey and discrete choice models as well as applicability of the results to
urban areas outside of Alameda County and Richmond. Understanding these limitations allows more informed interpretations of the
model results.
    First, the use of a survey could lead to respondents’ lack of comprehension, policy response bias, and selection bias, all of which
could a<U+FB00>ect the data. For instance, respondents in the treatment group may have had an incomplete understanding of the ATS
bene<U+FB01>ts statement. If this statement was not fully understood, the e<U+FB00>ect of the treatment may not have been as strong when parents
considered whether there was an additional morning or afternoon for ATS. We aimed to avoid this problem with a simple question
asking for an answer that, if the respondent understood the statement, was apparent. Some respondents in the treatment group did
not answer this question correctly, and were thus removed from the data used to develop the model. Policy response bias is when the
respondent answers questions thinking that there is a “correct” answer. For example, parents may have said their children walk or
bike to school once a week, but in truth, they do so much less frequently. The data collected also exclude a signi<U+FB01>cant portion of
parents that could have participated. Since the distribution method of these electronic surveys was through PTAs, parents who are not

                                                                   34

E. Lucken et al.                                                                                                Journal of Transport & Health 10 (2018) 28–36


on the PTA email list were not represented. We received no responses to the Spanish or paper versions of our survey, indicating lack
of representation of parents with language or technology barriers to participation. The skew in our sample towards White and high-
income respondents could also indicate self-selection bias among those who chose to take the survey. While we had responses from 50
unique schools, slightly over half of the responses were from just four schools, which tended to have high test scores. This could skew
results toward characteristics unique to those schools. The treatment group could also su<U+FB00>er from self-selection bias, as respondents
whose surveys began with information about ATS bene<U+FB01>ts may have been more likely to continue if their child already performed
ATS.
    Another aspect of this study with limitations is the use of a discrete choice model to determine the signi<U+FB01>cance of factors that
in<U+FB02>uence ATS perceptions and behavior. The logit model used to explain patterns in the data relies on assumptions that may not be
reasonable. One assumption is that decision-makers are highly rational and know their entire choice set and the characteristics of
each alternative. The model also assumes that decision-makers aim to maximize utility, an unobserved parameter comparable to
“happiness.” While in some settings these assumptions work, parents may not act rationally nor be trying to maximize utility. There
may be other models that could better capture parents’ behavior, such as the random regret model, where decision-makers minimize
the anticipated regret of a decision. The decisions that maximize utility may not be those that minimize regret, especially when
parents are faced with decisions relating to their children’s safety.
    Lastly, this study was conducted in Alameda County and Richmond, California, where parents may have di<U+FB00>erent attitudes toward
ATS than parents living in other parts of the country. Also, since the study was done in a highly urbanized region, the results may not
suitably inform policy in rural communities where the built environment and barriers to ATS are di<U+FB00>erent.

4.2. Policy recommendations and future research

   While providing parents with information about ATS health and academic bene<U+FB01>ts was found not to have a statistically signi<U+FB01>cant
impact on parent perception of ATS feasibility, this research yielded results that support several other policy recommendations to
promote ATS. The <U+FB01>rst four recommendations are in order of increasing time and/or cost to complete, while the <U+FB01>fth applies to all
planned interventions:

1.   Organize WSBs and other programs that reduce the time cost of ATS for parents.
2.   Promote use of school buildings and grounds for after-school activities to limit the need to travel between locations.
3.   Construct sidewalks and other pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure on routes to school.
4.   Build schools in areas with dense, mixed-use development and encourage such development around existing schools.
5.   Examine the equity implications of any interventions and involve vulnerable populations such as low-income individuals,
     minorities, disabled individuals, and women in the planning and implementation process.

    Models estimated from responses to our survey indicate that these interventions would increase parent perception of ATS fea-
sibility, increase the probability of participating in ATS frequently or every day, and decrease the probability of never doing ATS. This
would in turn decrease VMT and congestion associated with school travel from their current levels of 5-7% of total VMT and 10-14%
of private vehicles on the road during morning peak hours.
    Regarding the last policy item about ATS equity, future research is recommended to better understand the factors in<U+FB02>uencing ATS
behavior and perception of ATS feasibility among low-income and minority families in the East Bay. Such research should include
targeted outreach to schools with high proportions of low-income, minority, and English as a Second Language students, potentially
through in-person communication with community groups and after-school activities associated with these schools. More complete
and representative data from these families would inform strategies to meet their speci<U+FB01>c needs and also improve the models pre-
sented in this paper, enabling a stronger analysis of the impact of policy interventions on ATS levels in Richmond and Alameda
County, California.
