1. Introduction
     Physical activity is well-established as a health-enhancing behaviour for children and adolescents (Poitras et al., 2016). Parti-
cipation in regular physical activity is associated with improved cardio-metabolic health, better musculoskeletal health, weight
maintenance, and increased psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents (Poitras et al., 2016; Rhodes et al., 2017; Whooten

R. Uddin, et al.                                                                                Journal of Transport & Health 15 (2019) 100637
et al., 2019). Based on the demonstrated relationships between physical activity and health outcomes, the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends =60 min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years
(Rhodes et al., 2017). Globally, however, four out of <U+FB01>ve (81%) adolescents aged 11–18 years do not meet these recommendations
and are insu<U+FB03>ciently active (Aubert et al., 2018a; Rhodes et al., 2017).
    Active school commuting (ASC; e.g., walking and/or bicycling to/from school) can contribute towards attaining the re-
commendations of physical activity by integrating ASC into children and adolescents’ daily routine (Larouche et al., 2014; Schoeppe
et al., 2013; Voss, 2018; Xu et al., 2013). According to a recent meta-analysis, ASC accounts for 23–36% of the daily physical activity
in children and adolescents (Martin et al., 2016). Recent <U+FB01>ndings showed that adolescents using ASC accumulated 39.8% of daily
physical activity during the school commute time (Kek et al., 2019). Convincing evidence suggests that children and adolescents who
use active commuting are more likely to be physically active than those who rely on motorised (passive) forms of transport (Kek et al.,
2019; Larouche et al., 2014; Schoeppe et al., 2013; Voss, 2018). Additionally, ASC may promote independence, development of social
skills (Carver et al., 2011), and positive emotional experiences during school commute time in children and adolescents (Ramanathan
et al., 2014).
    Participation in ASC is low in many countries worldwide (Aubert et al., 2018a, 2018b; González et al., 2018; Manyanga et al.,
2018). A study of 72,845 schoolchildren across 34 countries reported that less than 50% of male adolescents in 13 countries and
female adolescents in 16 countries used ASC for at least one day of the week (Guthold et al., 2010). Using a di<U+FB00>erent de<U+FB01>nition of ASC
for at least 3 days a week, a recent study with adolescents aged 11–18 years in 26 Latin American and the Caribbean countries
reported the ASC prevalence of 42%, with 23 countries reporting a median of < 3 days/week (Aguilar-Farias et al., 2018).
    Studies conducted in developed countries reported that a variety of factors such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status are as-
sociated with ASC among adolescents. Several studies have found that a greater proportion of younger versus older adolescents
(Fulton et al., 2005; Mandic et al., 2015; Pabayo et al., 2011) and male versus female adolescents use ASC (Babey et al., 2009; Nelson
et al., 2008; Potoglou and Arslangulova, 2017). While low socioeconomic status such as low family income has been associated with
higher rates of ASC (Babey et al., 2009; McDonald, 2008), other socioeconomic status indicators such as parental education or
employment were not associated with ASC (Evenson et al., 2003; Timperio et al., 2006). However, only a handful of studies from
developing countries examined the rates of ASC by age, sex, and socioeconomic status (Ermagun and Samimi, 2015; Li and Zhao,
2015).
    Many of the countries in the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region are characterised by growing urbanisation, increased use of technology (Pawar,
2017), and a rapid growth in motorisation (Leung et al., 2017), which may limit the opportunities for active commuting. Though the
prevalence of insu<U+FB03>cient physical activity among adolescents in Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries is high, ranging from 73% in South-East Asian
countries to 85.0% in Western Paci<U+FB01>c countries (Darfour-Oduro et al., 2018; Rhodes et al., 2017), little is known about the prevalence
of ASC across this region with the exception of data from Australia (Schranz et al., 2018) and New Zealand (Smith et al., 2018).
Understanding the local context and cross-country di<U+FB00>erences in adolescents’ ASC patterns is essential to inform development of
policies and programs to promote ASC and ultimately increase physical activity levels among adolescents in the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region.
The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of ASC by sex and age groups, and examine the association of ASC with
global indices (e.g., human development index, Gini coe<U+FB03>cient) among adolescents from 27 Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries.
2. Methods
    Publicly available data from the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries that participated in the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS)
between 2007 and 2016 were analysed (World Health Organization, n.d.). The GSHS is a population-based survey of school-going
children and adolescents around the world. The GSHS uses the same standardised sampling technique, study methodology, and the
same self-administered anonymous questionnaire in all participating countries.
    The GSHS questionnaire included 10 core modules that address the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among school-aged
children and adolescents and adults worldwide. The survey participants completed a self-administered anonymous questionnaire,
which included, but was not limited to, questions on demographics (e.g., age, sex), and physical activity behaviours including active
commuting to and from school.
    As of 31 January 2019, 30 Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries/territories had at least one GSHS dataset publicly available with the surveys
being conducted between 2007 and 2016 (World Health Organization, n.d.). For countries that had more than one GSHS dataset, the
most recent dataset available was used in this study. Of the 30 countries, 27 had ASC data in the GSHS with 106,605 adolescents aged
13–17 years completing the ASC item of the survey, and thus formed the analytical sample for these analyses. All countries provided
nationally representative samples.
    The GSHS received ethics approval from the Ministry of Education or a relevant Institutional Ethics Review Committee, or both in
each of the participating countries. Only those adolescents and their parents who provided written or verbal consent participated. As
the current study used retrospective, de-identi<U+FB01>ed, publicly available data, ethics approval was not required for this secondary
analysis.
2.1. Active commuting to and from school
    ASC was assessed using the question: ‘During the past 7 days, on how many days did you walk or ride a bicycle to and from
school?’ with response options being: 0 to 7 days. Students were classi<U+FB01>ed as ‘active transport’ users if they rode or walked to and
from school on at least three days during the past 7 days, in accordance with previous research (Aguilar-Farias et al., 2018).
                                                                    2

R. Uddin, et al.                                                                                Journal of Transport & Health 15 (2019) 100637
2.2. Other measures
    Adolescents self-reported age and sex in the survey. World Bank country classi<U+FB01>cation, at the time of the survey for the respective
countries, was used to group the countries into three income categories (i.e., low- and lower-middle income, upper-middle income,
and high-income) (World Bank, n.d.). Of the 27 countries, 16 were classi<U+FB01>ed as low- and lower-middle income, seven as upper-
middle-income, and three as high-income economies. French Polynesia and Wallis and Futuna were considered as high-income
countries as those island nations are overseas collectivities of the French Republic, which is a high-income country. Information on
Cook Island's income classi<U+FB01>cation was not available (supplementary Table e1).
    Country-level data on the Human Development Index (2007-16 data; a higher score represents a greater human development)
(United Nations Development Programme, n. d.-c), Gender Inequality Index (2005–2016 data; a higher score represents greater
gender inequality) (United Nations Development Programme, n.d.-b) and the Gini coe<U+FB03>cient (2010-15 data; a higher coe<U+FB03>cient
represents greater income inequality) (United Nations Development Programme, n.d.-d), and expenditure on health (total health
expenditure as percentage of GDP, 2005–2015 data) (United Nations Development Programme, n.d.-a) were collected. The Human
Development Index and Expenditure on health were available for 22 countries (data were not available for Cook Island, French
Polynesia, Nauru, Tuvalu, and Wallis and Futuna). The Gini coe<U+FB03>cient was available for 20 countries (data not available for Brunei
Darussalam, Cambodia, Cook Island, French Polynesia, Nauru, Tuvalu, and Wallis and Futuna). The Gender Inequality Index was
available for 18 countries (data not available for Cook Island, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste,
Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Wallis and Futuna).
2.3. Statistical analyses
    The analysis was restricted to adolescents aged 13–17 years as all the GSHS participating countries have data in this age range
(World Health Organization, n.d.). Participants with missing data for sex, age, and ASC were excluded from the analyses. To examine
the potential for these missing data to bias the <U+FB01>ndings, logistic regression was used to compare demographic characteristics between
adolescents with and without the missing data. For each country, ASC data were summarised by using median and inter-quartile
range. Country-wise weighted estimates of the prevalence of ASC and their 95% con<U+FB01>dence interval (95% CI) were computed by sex
and age group (13–15 vs 16–17 years), by taking into account the weighting factor that was applied to each participant record to
adjust for non-response and the varying probability of selection. This weighting factor was applied in an identical way to estimate the
outcome variables of interest in each country where the GSHS was conducted. Within the GSHS protocol, weighting accounted for the
probability of selection of schools and classrooms, non-responding schools and students, and distribution of the population by sex and
grade.
    Random e<U+FB00>ects meta-analysis with the DerSimonian and Laird inverse-variance method (Sterne, 2009) was used to generate
pooled estimates of overall prevalence of ASC and the prevalence by country's income category (e.g., low- and lower-middle income,
upper-middle income, and high-income). metaprop, a Stata meta-analysis routine for binary outcomes, was used to estimate the
pooled prevalence with exact method to compute the 95% CI for the estimates. Possible sex and age group di<U+FB00>erences on ASC were
also examined by using logistic regression with weights for each country separately. Spearman correlational analysis was used to
assess how prevalence of ASC was associated with common global indices.
3. Results
    Among adolescents in this sample (n = 106,605) the mean age was 14.7 (SD = 1.28; range 13-17) years and 52.0% were males.
Descriptive characteristics, including survey year, response rate, sex, and age distribution for each of the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries
included in the analysis are presented in supplementary Table e1. No signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences in demographic characteristics were
observed between adolescents with complete data and those excluded because of missing data.
    Overall, the median days adolescents used active transport to and from school was 2 days for males and 1 day for females
(supplementary Table e1). Two out of <U+FB01>ve adolescents in the participating countries used active transport to and from school at least
3 days/week with weighted pooled prevalence being 42.1% (95% CI 36.7-47.6) (Table 1). In six countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia,
Mongolia, Myanmar, Vanuatu, and Vietnam), over 50% of the adolescents reported using active transport to and from school on at
least 3 days/week with Vietnamese adolescents having had the highest prevalence of 73.9% (72.3-75.4) (Fig. 1). The three countries
with the lowest prevalence of ASC (Brunei Darussalam, Timor Leste, and Tuvalu) reported that less than a <U+FB01>fth of their adolescents
used active transport to and from school on at least 3 days/week with the lowest prevalence in the Timor Leste (16.5%, 15.1-17.9).
    The prevalence of ASC on at least 3 days/week was 40.8% (34.9-46.7) among females and 43.1% (37.7-48.4) among males
(Table 1). However, signi<U+FB01>cant sex di<U+FB00>erences were observed in a third (n = 9) of the countries with greater prevalence of ASC
among female adolescents in two countries (Mongolia and the Philippines) and greater prevalence of ASC among male adolescents in
seven countries (Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Timor Leste) (Table 2). For example, female
adolescents in Mongolia had 46% higher odds of using ASC compared to their male counterparts (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.28-1.66). In
contrast, in Pakistan female adolescents had one-third the odds of using ASC (0.34, 0.29-0.39), which means that male adolescents in
Pakistan had three times higher odds of using ASC than their female counterparts.
    When data were analysed by age group, 41.7% (35.8-47.7) of the older adolescents (aged 16–17 years) reported using ASC
compared to 43.0% (37.5-48.4) for younger adolescents (aged 13–15 years) (Table 1). About half (13/27) of the countries de-
monstrated mixed age di<U+FB00>erences in the use of ASC (Table 2). Compared to younger adolescents, older adolescents had higher odds of
                                                                     3

ASC in six countries (Brunei Darussalam, Fiji, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, and the Philippines), and lower odds in seven countries
(Cook Island, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, Vietnam, and Wallis and Futuna). For example, the odds of using ASC was 38%
higher among older adolescents versus younger adolescents in Brunei Darussalam (OR 1.38, 1.09-1.75). In contrast, the odds of using
ASC was 40% lower among older versus younger adolescents in Sri Lanka (0.60, 0.38-0.97).
     The prevalence of ASC decreased with the increase of country's economic status with a pooled prevalence of 48.9% (40.9-56.9) in
low- and lower-middle-income countries, 33.3% (29.4-37.2) in upper-middle-income countries, and 27.4% (13.7-41.1) in high-
income countries (Table 1). Male adolescents had signi<U+FB01>cantly higher prevalence of ASC than female adolescents in lower-middle-
income countries (51.1% vs 47.3%, p < 0.001) and upper-middle-income countries (33.9% vs 32.8%, p = 0.024). In upper-middle-
income countries, younger adolescents had signi<U+FB01>cantly higher prevalence than their older counterparts (34.0% vs 30.9%,
p < 0.001).
     The country prevalence of ASC in adolescents was negatively associated with the country Gini coe<U+FB03>cient (rho = -0.50,
p = 0.04); however, none of the other global indices was signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with the prevalence of ASC (Human Development
Index p = 0.13; Gender Inequality Index p = 0.94; expenditure on health p = 0.54; Fig. 2).
4. Discussion
     In this study, the pooled prevalence of adolescents' ASC in the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region was 42.1% (95% CI 36.7-47.6) with con-
siderable variations across the countries. Similarly, the pooled prevalence of ASC by sex and age varied across countries and within
countries with signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences observed in some but not all countries. Prevalence of ASC in adolescents was negatively as-
sociated with country's Gini coe<U+FB03>cient and decreased with the increase of country's economic status. Taken together, these <U+FB01>ndings
demonstrate a large variability in the prevalence of adolescents' ASC in Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region as well as di<U+FB00>erences in adolescents'

environmental, and policy factors that in<U+FB02>uence adolescents' ASC behaviours (Sallis et al., 2006). Understanding ASC correlates in the
local context will help inform the design and tailoring of country- and/or region-speci<U+FB01>c interventions and policies for promoting ASC
and ultimately integrating physical activity into everyday life of adolescents.
     This study identi<U+FB01>ed signi<U+FB01>cant variations in the prevalence of adolescents' ASC across the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries ranging from
73.9% in Vietnam to 16.5% in Timor Leste. Similar cross-country variations in adolescents' ASC have been previously reported across
34 countries worldwide (Guthold et al., 2010) and in 26 Latin American and the Caribbean countries (Aguilar-Farias et al., 2018). The
average prevalence of ASC reported in this study is similar to the prevalence of adolescents' ASC found in Australia (Schranz et al.,
2018) and New Zealand (Smith et al., 2018). ASC provides an opportunity for adolescents to accumulate physical activity (Chillón
et al., 2011; Larouche et al., 2014; Saksvig et al., 2007; Schoeppe et al., 2013; Voss, 2018) and could add up to a substantial amount
of weekly physical activity in this age group even if they combine active and motorised modes of transport to and from school (Kek
et al., 2019).
     In the current study, the pooled prevalence of ASC also varied by sex and age across Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c countries. Signi<U+FB01>cantly higher
rates of ASC in females were observed in nine countries, higher rates in males in seven countries, and no signi<U+FB01>cant sex di<U+FB00>erences in
11 countries. Similarly, compared to younger adolescents, older adolescents had signi<U+FB01>cantly higher odds of ASC in six countries and
lower odds in seven countries, whereas no signi<U+FB01>cant age di<U+FB00>erences in ASC were found in 14 countries. Many studies from high-
income countries reported higher rates of ASC among male versus female adolescents (Nelson et al., 2008; Potoglou and
Arslangulova, 2017) and among younger versus older adolescents (Fulton et al., 2005; Pabayo et al., 2011). A recent New Zealand
study reported that adolescents using ASC as part of their school journey achieved higher levels of daily physical activity measured
using accelerometers compared to adolescents relying solely on motorised transport to and from school with the observed di<U+FB00>erences
being mainly for adolescent females (Kek et al., 2019). Therefore, in addition to sex-related di<U+FB00>erences in the prevalence of ASC, the
amount of physical activity accumulated during ASC may be di<U+FB00>erent in adolescent males versus females. Country-speci<U+FB01>c e<U+FB00>orts for
encouraging ASC as a means to increase physical activity among adolescents need to focus on subgroups of adolescents who would
bene<U+FB01>t most from such interventions and programs.
     Available evidence suggests a wide range of individual, social, environmental, and policy factors in<U+FB02>uence ASC in adolescents
(Davison et al., 2008; Panter et al., 2008; Pont et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2011), with distance to school being one of the major
determinants of ASC (Davison et al., 2008; Ikeda et al., 2018; Panter et al., 2008). In addition, factors such as parental support for
ASC (Aibar Solana et al., 2018; Carver et al., 2010; Huertas-Delgado et al., 2017), built environment-related factors such as presence
of footpaths and cycle lanes (Pocock et al., 2019), factors related to tra<U+FB03>c and personal safety (Carver et al., 2005; Esteban-Cornejo
et al., 2016; Hopkins and Mandic, 2017; Mandic et al., 2017a), and school policies on whether adolescents have to enrol in the closest
school (Mandic et al., 2017b) di<U+FB00>er between countries and even within the countries (such as in urban versus rural areas). These
                                                                         6

di<U+FB00>erences may contribute to cross-country variations in rates of ASC among adolescents observed in this and other studies. Addi-
tional factors such as school uniform requirements (Hopkins and Mandic, 2017), school bag weight (Mandic et al., 2018), and cycling
helmet legislation (Molina-García et al., 2018) also vary across the countries and may further in<U+FB02>uence country-speci<U+FB01>c rates of ASC
among adolescents. However, most of the current evidence on correlates of ASC in adolescents is available from studies conducted in
high-income countries and may not be generalisable to the low- and medium-income countries or the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region where ASC
may often be a necessity rather than a choice (Manyanga et al., 2018).
    The present study showed that the prevalence of ASC increased with a decrease of country's economic status and an increased
degree of income inequality within a country (i.e., higher Gini index). These <U+FB01>ndings suggest that individual, social, environmental,
and policy factors that in<U+FB02>uence ASC (and possibly their relative contributions) likely also vary by country's economic status and
should be examined in LMICs (in addition to studies conducted in high-income countries). For example, cross-country di<U+FB00>erences in
factors such as distance to school, availability of vehicles and bicycles at home, existence and quality of a pedestrian and/or cycling
infrastructure, tra<U+FB03>c and personal safety, and availability and a<U+FB00>ordability of public transport are at least in part in<U+FB02>uenced by
countries' economic status. These <U+FB01>ndings further emphasise the need for collecting and reporting country-speci<U+FB01>c data on ASC
correlates, particularly in LMICs where such data are currently lacking. Such country-speci<U+FB01>c data are fundamental to inform the
design of future interventions and guide policy development e<U+FB00>orts in LMICs to encourage ASC among adolescents.
4.1. Strengths and limitations
    Study strengths include a pooled analysis with a large number of participants (n = 106,605) from nationally representative
samples from 27 countries in the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region. Study limitations include travel to/from school being self-reported using a single
survey question, lack of data related to distance from home to school and use of public transport for school travel, and lack of GSHS
data from Australia and New Zealand. Unavailability of information about characteristics of the non-respondents limited the scope of
comparing respondents with non-respondents and their potential e<U+FB00>ects on the interpretation of the <U+FB01>ndings. Studies conducted in
high-income countries found that socioeconomic factors such as fewer vehicles at home (Mandic et al., 2015; McDonald, 2008), and
low socioeconomic status and household income (Davison et al., 2008; Pabayo et al., 2011) are associated with higher rates of ASC in
adolescents. Therefore, future studies comparing ASC across di<U+FB00>erent countries should examine factors related to geographical,
                                                                      7

cultural, and socioeconomic contexts including distance to school, the availability and use of public transport, and social and built
environment to understand between-country variations in ASC. Collecting information on di<U+FB00>erent ASC-related factors is particularly
important in LMICs in which such data may not be readily available from other sources. Understanding of country-speci<U+FB01>c factors
related to the built environment and urban and social planning policies would help identify the levers for country-speci<U+FB01>c policy
actions to encourage ASC among adolescents.
5. Conclusions
    In this study, two out of <U+FB01>ve adolescents in the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region used ASC with large variations between the countries as well as
by age and sex. Prevalence of ASC in adolescents was negatively associated with country's Gini coe<U+FB03>cient and decreased with the
increase of country's economic status. These <U+FB01>ndings underscore the importance of understanding multiple factors that in<U+FB02>uence
adolescents' ASC within each country/region. Interventions to boost ASC tailored to the local context will have the potential to
contribute to increasing levels of physical activity and ultimately improving the health and wellbeing of adolescents, including those
living in the Asia-Paci<U+FB01>c region.
