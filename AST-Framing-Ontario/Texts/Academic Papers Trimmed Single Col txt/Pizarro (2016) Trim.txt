1. Introduction
     Active commuting to school (ACS) has been proposed as a potentially source of physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents
(Chillon et al., 2010; Davison et al., 2008) and can represent 20–30% of daily moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (Klinker et al.,
2014; Southward et al., 2012). With decreasing levels of physical activity in children and adolescents, ACS due to its regular nature, is likely
to be a key element for children's health (Pizarro et al., 2013; Tudor-Locke et al., 2001) and interventions to encourage ACS are becoming a
priority in some countries (Active Healthy Kids Canada, 2013; National Safe Routes to School Taskforce, 2008). However, most research on
transport-related physical activity (PA) relies on self-reported data and geographic information systems (GIS) based estimates of routes
taken, which are not always representative of actual routes (Duncan and Mummery, 2007). Thus, comparing results across studies should
be done with caution as discrepant methods are commonly used to access and classify ACS (Sirard and Slater, 2008).
     Global position system (GPS) tracking used in combination with accelerometer data, is arising as an objective approach to assess means of
transport and reduce self-reporting bias (Feng and Timmermans, 2013; Kerr et al., 2011). Moreover, as several built environment features that

may be related to ACS were identi<U+FB01>ed (Pont et al., 2009), the joint use of GPS data and GIS can inform researchers about the real exposure to
these different environments. Despite the advantages advocated by this new approach, data processing emerges as a challenge due to the
large size and complexity of this type of data. Novel and robust methods are requested to improve the investigation on the relationship
between PA and environment (McCrorie et al., 2014). The Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) (2013) is a web-based
application capable of integrating and processing activity and location data in a relatively simple way and may be the key to unify methods
and allow for comparison of results helping in clari<U+FB01>cation of <U+FB01>ndings in this <U+FB01>eld (https://ucsd-palms-project.wikispaces.com/).
    Similar to countries like the United States (McDonald, 2007) or United Kingdom (Black et al., 2001), Portuguese transportation statistics
reveal an alarming drop of 54% in active commuting in the general population in the last 10 years. Despite being scarce, data for ACS in
Portugal shows that only around half of the students use active transportation (Cooper et al., 2005; Mota et al., 2007) and reveals a huge
potential for interventions to increase physical activity. While evidence suggest that ACS is in<U+FB02>uenced by country speci<U+FB01>c environmental
and cultural factors (Faulkner et al., 2009), little is known about Portuguese adolescent's mode of travel to school, distance and time
traveled. Therefore, in order to provide a more complete description of the daily transport patterns, using data from GPS and accel-
erometer, our main aims were: 1) determine the characteristics of the journey between home and school; 2) analyze its contribution to
achieve physical activity guidelines; 3) analyze the relationship between distance traveled to school and transportation mode.
2. Methods
    Three public secondary schools from Porto County were selected to participate in this study. In order to maximize environmental
variability, we have randomly selected one school near the beach, one near the city center and one in the suburbs. To be eligible, students
needed to participate in physical education classes (mandatory within the Portuguese Educational System), and report an absence of
physical and mental health problems. Both participants and their parents received a complete explanation of the purpose of the inves-
tigation and in the case of a positive participation, signed a written consent to participate in the study After excluding respondents with
missing accelerometer and GPS data, the <U+FB01>nal sample consisted of 155 adolescents (55% females) between 14 and 18 years (mean age
15.9 71.1 years old). Data from participants with at least one home–school–home journey were included in the analyses. Participants
provided a voluntary written consent from their parents to participate in this study. Data were con<U+FB01>dential and were collected between
February 2013 and May 2014. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Faculty of Sports ethics committee, the Portuguese
Foundation for Science and Technology and from the regional section of the Ministry of Education.
2.1. Measurements
2.1.1. Physical activity
    Physical activity was measured using Actigraph accelerometers, model GT3X þ (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL). Accelerometers were initi-
alized to collect 30 Hz and Actilife software was used to initialize and download devices, and compile the RAW data to 30 second epochs.
Evenson cut-points were used to categorize MVPA (2296 counts/min) (Evenson et al., 2008) as they seem to exhibit signi<U+FB01>cantly better
accuracy than others in children and adolescents (Trost et al., 2011).
2.1.2. Positional data
    Positional data were recorded every 15 s using a Qstarz BT-Q1000XT Travel Recorder. Besides a high accuracy under various envir-
onmental conditions and good signal acquisition time (Duncan et al., 2009), this device also showed an acceptable dynamic accuracy
during different modes of transportation, in different environments. The median error during walking trips was 3.9 m, 2.0 m for bicycle
trips, 1.5 m for bus and 0.5 m for car (Schipperijn et al., 2014).
2.1.3. GPS and accelerometer protocols
    Participants were requested to wear the accelerometer and the GPS device attached to an elastic belt and placed on opposite sides of
their waist for 7 consecutive days. Children were trained to switch on and off and to charge the GPS monitors overnight. Instructions were
given to wear the monitors all times except when sleeping, bathing, swimming or other water activities.
    The Personal Activity Location Measurement System (PALMS) (https://ucsd-palms-project.wikispaces.com/) was used for Data pro-
cessing and analyses. First, PALMS used distance and speed between GPS points to classify whether each epoch was part of a trip and the
trip mode based on the following protocol:
– groups of sequential <U+FB01>xes (Z 2 min) were considered trips if they spanned Z100 m with an average speed of Z1.5 km/h;
– pauses of up to 3 min were allowed during a trip to account for circumstances such as stop lights.
    Trips were classi<U+FB01>ed into Walking trips if they had a 90th percentile speed of o10 km/h; trips with a 90th percentile speed between 10
and 35 km/h were classi<U+FB01>ed as bicycling trips and trips were considered vehicle trips if they had a 90th percentile speed of Z35 km/h
(Carlson et al., 2014). points estimated to be indoors were removed from the starts and ends of trips. Indoor detection was based on a
maximum value of signal to noise ratio of 225 and a maximum satellite ratio of 50. Second, PALMS processed accelerometer data based on
Evensons' cut points and a non-wear time de<U+FB01>nition of 60 min of consecutive zeros (Evenson et al., 2008). Finally, data was processed to
produce a 30 s aggregated dataset with the information from both monitors.
    School and participant's home addresses were then geocoded. A school was de<U+FB01>ned as the parcel on which the geocode point fell,
while a 25 m Euclidean buffer was applied to participants' home address point to account for signal errors. Afterwards, a PostgreSQL
database was built to combine the PALMS dataset with GIS data to identify trips that started at school and ended at home and vice-versa.
    Anthropometric measurements were taken with adolescents in bare feet and lightly dressed. Height (cm) was measured with SECA 206
Bodymeter Measuring Tape (SECA, Hamburg Germany) and weight (kg) was assessed using digital scales (TANITA BF-522 W, Tokyo, Japan).

                                                 A.N. Pizarro et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 3 (2016) 297–304                             299
Participants body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2. Adolescents were then categorized into ‘normal weight’ or
‘overweight’ (including obese) according to age- and sex-speci<U+FB01>c cut-off points for children (Cole et al., 2000).
    Demographic data was obtained through a questionnaire including information on birth date, home address and gender.
2.1.4. Statistical procedures
    Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 21; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Signi<U+FB01>cance level was set at 5% (po 0.05). Descriptive
statistics were used to characterize the sample. For the purpose of this paper the analysis were conducted by trip instead of by partici-
pants. To analyze the relationship between distances traveled to school and transportation mode, we used a random intercepts mixed
effects regression model to account for the nested structure of the data (trips within persons). Schools were included as <U+FB01>xed effect due to
the limited number of schools participating. Due to large differences between boys and girls, we conducted analyses strati<U+FB01>ed by sex to
ascertain the effects of distance, age, body mass index (BMI), number of trips per person and school on the likelihood to active commute to
school. To interpret the variation of trips within the participants an intraclass correlation coef<U+FB01>cient (ICC) was calculated by sex.
3. Results
3.1. Sample characteristics and overall trips
    Descriptive data for the demographic characteristics of the sample and overall trips detected can be found in Table 1.
    A total of 7220 trips were identi<U+FB01>ed with a median length of 678.2 m and a median duration of 6.5 minutes. From these trips, 73.6%
(5312) were active trips (walking and bicycle) while 26.4% (1908) were passive. The longest active trip detected was 4439.3 m.
    Walking was the preferred mode of travel in our sample (57.6%) while only 16% of all trips detected were done by bicycle. As expected,
walking trips were used for shorter distances (mean 0.5 km) while motorized vehicle trips were considerably longer (mean 5.8 km).
During weekend days a 20% drop in walking trips was observed while the number of vehicle trips increased (Fig. 1). Home–school–home
trips constituted 9.5% of the total number of active trips. Looking at participants instead of trips we found that 64% of the adolescents used
active transport to school during most school days.
3.2. Journey between home and school
    60.7% of the adolescents had valid GPS information for at least one of their home–school–home journeys. A higher proportion of
females had valid data on home-school trips (61 vs 39% p ¼0.000) when compared to males. No differences were found between ado-
lescents with valid vs invalid data on home-school-home trips in age or BMI.
    On average participants recorded 7 trips between home and school. The most frequently used travel mode was walking (68.8%), followed
by vehicle (16.7%) and bicycle (14.4%). Median walking trip length between home and school was 0.9 km, with the longest walking trip being
3.4 km. For walking home–school trips the mean time spent in MVPA was 1275.6 min, i.e. 78% of the total trip time and representing 20% of
recommended guidelines of 60 min of MVPA. This further characteristics of the school journey are provided in Table 2.
3.3. Distance traveled by transportation mode
    As illustrated in Fig. 2, almost all of the walking trips to/from school (96.7%) were within 2.0 km. Similarly, bicycle trips occurred mostly
(92%) within 2.0 km. Of the vehicle trips 80.7% were within 3.5 km and 96.4% within 5.0 km.
    After the <U+FB01>rst km as distance increases, the number of walking trips decreases and are replaced by an increasing number of vehicle
trips, as expected. Journeys longer than 4.5 km are exclusively made by vehicle while in trips under 0.5 km no vehicle trips were observed
and at 1.0 km only a small percentage of vehicle trips were observed (3.3%). Bicycle trips were observed within a 4.5 km range.

3.4. Direction of the trip
    As home to school and school to home trips usually do not take place at the same times of the day, meaning diverse environmental
context (social, traf<U+FB01>c, day-light), differences between trip direction were tested. Signi<U+FB01>cant differences in minutes in MVPA and duration
were found whether the trip started at home or at school (Table 3).
    When walking was the mode of transportation, home to school trips took longer and had more minutes in MVPA than the school to
home trips. Minutes spent in MVPA during the trips were also different for bicycling and vehicle however in those cases the home to
school trip contributed with more time in MVPA.
    Despite walking was the dominant mode of transportation in both directions, a signi<U+FB01>cant 16% increase in walking trips was found for
school-home trips when compared to home-school trips (Fig. 3).
3.5. Correlates of transportation mode
    For each additional km in trip distance there was a 68% decrease in the odds of active commuting in boys (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.16–0.63)
and a 90% decrease in odds of active commuting in girls (OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04–0.25). The ICC was 1.2% for girls and 8% for boys ( Table 4).
4. Discussion
    Our study was one of the <U+FB01>rst using objective methods to classify trip modes in home-school journeys and measuring the actual route
distance. To date most studies have relied on less accurate methods.
    Our results showed that walking was the most frequent (68.8%) means of travel in home-school trips. Although a higher percentage
was found, this result is in line with another European study that reported walking as main mode used in 44.8% of home-school trips
followed by cycling (34.6%) (Dessing et al., 2014). On the other hand, a Belgian investigation, centered on participants instead of trips,
observed that only 6.6% of the adolescents walked to school while 51.8% cycled there (Van Dyck et al., 2010). Despite the different walking
percentages, active transportation was the main mode to get to school in these studies supporting previous research (Chillon et al., 2010;
Santos et al., 2009). In contrast, motorized transport in home-school journeys was the most used method of transport in the US (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002), Australia (Harten and Olds, 2004) and even in UK (Department for Transport, 2014) where
distances to school are usually longer than in most European countries (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). For
example, in Portugal, schools are built so the optimum distance one should live from school is 1.5 km or 30 min walking time, and the
maximum distance is 2.2 km or 45 min walking time (Departamento de Avaliação Prospectiva e Planeamento, 2000). In our sample 50% of

302                                              A.N. Pizarro et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 3 (2016) 297–304
the participants lived within the optimum distance to school (1.5 km) while 72% lived within 2.2 km, with a mean distance between home
and school of 2.1 km.
    In line with this premise, our <U+FB01>ndings revealed that 96.7% of walking school journeys occurred within 2.0 km as well as 92% of cycling
trips. So it is likely that in Portuguese adolescents the criterion and reasonable maximum distance for walking to school is 2.0 km. This
<U+FB01>nding is consistent with study by Van Dyck et al. (2010) and in line with study by Nelson and Woods (2010). In our opinion, it seems that
studying correlates of walking to school should be done within this distance removing it as a potential confounder. And intervention
efforts to increase walking should target students living within this distance.
    One possible explanation for the 2.0 km distance criterion found can be the urban planning policies mentioned above. This could be the
evidence needed for authorities to replicate this school siting policies in other settings for ACS proliferation. Another example is a study
from the Netherlands, were the average distance to an elementary school was smaller than 2.0 km, which showed that 79% of the trips to
school were made by active (Dessing et al., 2014).
    On the other hand, our <U+FB01>nding for cycling distances (2.0 km) is not in agreement with results of Belgium study (8.0 km) conducted by Van
Dyck et al. (2010) and Irish study (4.0 km) conducted by Nelson and Woods (2010). The difference might be due to difference in the built
environment, e.g. Porto is quite hilly, and a closer look at the built environment in these three cities might help explain the differences;
further research into this is needed. Another possible reason may be related to cycling not being a particular popular means of travel in
Portugal, especially in the northern region (Instituto Nacional de Estatistica, 2012). In fact, until 2014 cyclists were required by traf<U+FB01>c laws to
cycle on the roadside that often has bad pavement conditions as uneven ground, holes, rocks, and other obstacles affecting the stability and
traction of the bicycle and forcing cyclists to regular path deviations (Núcleo de Estudos e Planeamento, 2014). Moreover cycling was
considered unsafe as the probability of suffering a severe or fatal injury was four times greater than driving a car. This was because cyclists
did not have any road priorities or laws protecting them, they were not considered as vulnerable users and for example cars didn’t have to
slow down next to them (Núcleo de Estudos e Planeamento, 2014). Despite a possible overestimation (see in limitations of the study), only
8% of the school trips made by bike were over 2.0 km. According to other studies, that leaves an opportunity for increasing ACS in our
population by encouraging more young people to cycle for a distance of up to 4.0 or 8.0 km. In order to increase ACS, policies that remove
barriers and promote the conditions necessary for choosing active modes of transportation are needed (Cooper et al., 2010; Jensen, 2008).
These may include: 1) cycling-friendly infrastructures like separate bike lanes, traf<U+FB01>c calming measures, car free zones; 2) bike parking and
end of the trip facilities such as showers, bicycle stations, bike lockers; and 3) legal interventions as speed limits (Pucher et al., 2010).
Moreover, research identi<U+FB01>ed policies to increase walking and bicycling as an effective way of improving the safety of people involved in
these behaviors. As more people walk or bicycle the less likely any of them are to be injured. The most likely mechanism which underlies
safety for cyclists and walkers is modi<U+FB01>cation of motorists behavior as this in<U+FB02>uences the likelihood of collisions (Jacobsen, 2003).
    In Portugal, only in January 2014 an established law ended the obligation to cycle on the roadside (sometimes non existing) and
allowed bikers to take their place on the roads as any other vehicle (Decreto Lei n.° 72/2013 de 3 de setembro, 2013), giving them vehicle
priorities in order to promote safer bicycle riding and increase the rates of this behavior. This can be a turning point in the transportation
system and further research is needed to understand the implication of this modi<U+FB01>cation on rates of active transport to school for children
and adolescents.
    More minutes in MVPA were recorded during walking trips compared to during vehicle trips, as expected. In fact most of the walking trip
to/from school time (78%) was in MVPA. An average of 12 minutes, corresponding to 20% of recommended daily MVPA, were observed during
walking trips while vehicle trips only represented 2%. Moreover, trips to/from school were signi<U+FB01>cantly faster (4.15 km/h vs 3.08 km/h) than
trips to other destinations (data not shown). This observation emphasizes the meaningful role that the trip to school may play in youth
achieving recommended PA guidelines, and the associated potential for achieving health bene<U+FB01>ts. So, strategies aimed to increase this
behavior are a relevant approach for increasing physical activity levels. To our knowledge only two other studies objectively accessed time
spent in MVPA during a walking trip to school among adolescents. Similar to our results, Southward et al. (2012) observed approximately
11 min of MVPA during home-school trips, while in the study by Voss et al. (2014) walking trips only contributed with 9.2 min of MVPA on
average. Interestingly, the results by Voss et al. were comparable to ours in terms of distance and duration of the walking trips. Differences in
time in MVPA during school trips may be related to features of the built environment, for example slope, and further research is needed.
    Signi<U+FB01>cant differences between trips to school and from school were found, with more active transport taking place during the school-home
trip. One may speculate that these differences could be related to the pressure youth are submitted to get to school on time, <U+FB01>rst at home and due
to the traf<U+FB01>c congestion also during their trip to school. Longer trip duration and more time spent in MVPA during school–home walking trips may
be related to the absence of a schedule to accomplish allowing adolescents to spent more time on the trip. It may also be that adolescents travel
home with friends and may be involved in some kind of play during these trips. A signi<U+FB01>cant higher rate of walking was found for school-home
trips when compared with home-school trips. Although only few studies looked at this difference, similar results were found by other researchers
(Larsen et al., 2009; Schlossberg et al., 2006) taking us to believe that this is may be a common trend. Explanations for this trend are usually related
to the parental time schedule that allows parents to drive their children in the morning, while they are usually at work when their children leave
school. Therefore, on one hand opportunities may exist to increase ACS on the home–school trip; on the other hand more attention should be
given to the school–home trip when studying the relations between environmental features and active transport.
    Finally, although the variation of trips within the participants was higher in boys that in girls, according to our results larger distances
are likely to increase the odds of motorized travel in both boys and girls. In fact, distance is the strongest environmental predictor of school
travel mode choice (Wong et al., 2011). As changing school locations is unlikely in most countries, the implications of this <U+FB01>nding include
increasing the number of households within 2.0 km of the schools (i.e. urban densi<U+FB01>cation), building new schools closer to where students
live, and more feasible interventions like changing traf<U+FB01>c directions, building paths, connecting public transport and other travel planning
practices that enable more direct routes to school shortening the home–school distance. Moreover, as no signi<U+FB01>cant associations between
the probability of active commuting to school and BMI or age were found one can suggest that increasing ACS may be a simple and
effective strategy to help increase PA levels particularly for overweight adolescents that usually have less PA opportunities.
    This research contributes to increase the understanding of geographical variation of the relation between the environment and active
transportation. Strengths of this study include the use of objective measures of activity and location that were automatically combined to
assess trips to school and classify trip mode. This methodology reduces common bias of self-reporting and measures the actual route taken

                                                           A.N. Pizarro et al. / Journal of Transport & Health 3 (2016) 297–304                                                   303
between home and school, instead of common approximations such as Euclidean distances and shortest route approaches. Moreover, all
trips between home and school are included and not only trips before and after school, i.e., trips over lunch time are also included.
    Integration of acelerometry and GPS data is a relatively new and not enough is known about the optimal methods for manipulation of
this type of data. In fact, no consensus exist for guidance in dealing with these type of data issues (McCrorie et al., 2014). However, PALMS
is a free, simple and intuitive software that may be particularly helpful in future research as it uses several methods to reduce the error in
data, allowing researchers to manipulate protocols and quickly processes the complex datasets.
    This study has some limitations that should be mentioned. The three schools were selected to increase environmental variation in the
sample and may not represent the population, therefore limiting the generalizability of our <U+FB01>ndings. However, the results found provide a
signi<U+FB01>cant advancement in the unknown <U+FB01>eld of active commuting to school behavior among Portuguese adolescents, which will help
inform future research and physical activity interventions. GPS signal acquisition time when leaving school and home buildings might
have in<U+FB02>uence the number of trips included in our study as the <U+FB01>rst data point may have occurred outside the inclusion criterion distance.
Trip underestimation may also have occurred if journeys had intermediate stops longer than 5 minutes as our inclusion criteria did not
account these trips as home–school trips. Exploring pause time is therefore recommended for future studies particularly in school to home
trips, where children have more freedom to explore their environment. Other valid explanations for trip underestimation could be related
with children not wearing one or the two devices all times, children could have missed school, and also devices Mal functioning.
    The objective method used to categorize trips is based on GPS-derived travel speeds and may be, in our particular context, an over-
estimation of cycling trips. Despite, previous studies found a 73% agreement between PALMS bicycling and SenseCam trips (Carlson et al.,
2014) few adolescents from our sample self-reported cycling (data not shown). Moreover, unlike in the US were bus average speed is around
21.0 km/h (American public transportation assotiation, 2013), in Portugal, the average speed during public transportation is 15.7 km/h (STCP,
2013), similar to bicycle trips (Carlson et al., 2014). Moreover, hip-mounted accelerometers may not accurately detect bicycling activities
(Welk, 2002) and MVPA during this activities may be underestimated, therefore future studies should explore other devices with improved
capability of assessing this behavior. So, more research is needed in order to improve bicycle differentiation in the Portuguese context.
5. Conclusion
    Our study explored the school travel behavior among adolescents providing important data that could assist urban planners and public
health professionals in developing initiatives to increase rates of ACS and physical activity among youth.
    The main <U+FB01>ndings suggest that 1) walking is the most frequent means of transport to and from school and a round trip home-school-
home represents on average 40% of recommended daily MVPA; 2) 2.0 km seems to be a reasonable maximum distance for walking
between home and school, so planning and policy efforts should be made in order to achieve this distance; 3) cycling is uncommon and to
reach higher rates of active travel to school special attention should be given to cycling particularly in trips over 2.0 km; 4) Increasing
distance is associated with higher levels of passive transportation to school; 5) a distinction should be made between the home-school
and school-home trips when implementing strategies to increase ACS.
