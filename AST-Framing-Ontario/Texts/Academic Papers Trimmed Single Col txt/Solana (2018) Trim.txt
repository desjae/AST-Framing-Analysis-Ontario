1. Introduction

    Active commuting has potential to increase physical activity (PA) and improve public health by preventing common non-com-
municable diseases in adults (Andersen, 2017) and should be politically promoted. The likely e<U+FB00>ects of policies supporting active
commuting include important environmental and economical implications such as signi<U+FB01>cant reductions in tra<U+FB03>c-related air pol-
lution, level of noise or even climate change mitigation (Nieuwenhuijsen and Khreis, 2016). Nevertheless, the main bene<U+FB01>ts of
shifting from passive to active modes of transport are related to the health bene<U+FB01>ts associated with an increased PA (Rabl and de

Nazelle, 2012).
    Engaging children in PA during childhood is important as physical inactivity has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors
including obesity in this age group (Ekelund et al., 2012). Childhood is considered a period of life when establishment of habits and
positive attitudes towards PA plays an essential role for maintaining those habits throughout life. In terms of active commuting,
childhood deserves special attention as high rates of active commuting might persist into adulthood and consequently provide long-
term health bene<U+FB01>ts (Beige and Axhausen, 2012).
    Promoting active commuting is one of the solutions for integrating PA into children's daily life (Faulkner et al., 2009). Children
who walk or cycle to school have higher daily levels of PA (Davison et al., 2008; Pabayo et al., 2012) and better cardiovascular <U+FB01>tness
compared to children who use passive (i.e., motorized) modes of transport (Cooper et al., 2006). Active commuting to school (ACS)
may also contribute to preventing overweight and obesity (Pabayo et al., 2010). However, rates of ACS in children have declined over
the last decades in the most developed countries (Buliung et al., 2009; Chillon et al., 2013; Grize et al., 2010; Pavelka et al., 2017).
    Based on the recently published PASTA conceptual framework of active travel behaviour (Götschi et al., 2017), individual,
physical and social determinants have an important impact on individual's behaviour, including individual's preference to engage in
PA (Lake and Townshend, 2013). ACS is susceptible to environmental and social in<U+FB02>uences. For example, characteristics of the school
surroundings (Lovasi et al., 2011) and family in<U+FB02>uences on children's choice (Leung et al., 2016) are also in<U+FB02>uencing ACS. To reverse
the declining trend of ACS in children, barriers that may prevent children from walking or cycling to school should be further
examined in diverse geographical, cultural and political environments such as those that characterize European cities (Lu et al.,
2014).
    Given the strong in<U+FB02>uence of family on children's behaviours, ACS in children is also in<U+FB02>uenced by parental attitudes, values and
beliefs (Pont et al., 2009). For instance, parental concerns for safety (Carver et al., 2010) or parental perceived convenience of driving
(Trapp et al., 2011) are signi<U+FB01>cant predictors of ACS in children. Furthermore, other factors related to households, such as distance
from home to school (Merom et al., 2006), or parental mode of commuting to work (Henne et al., 2014) also signi<U+FB01>cantly in<U+FB02>uence
how children commute to school. Therefore, family factors and parental support represent important social environmental factors
that in<U+FB02>uence children's mode of transport to school (Mah et al., 2017).
    Most previous studies that examined parental barriers to ACS in children did not di<U+FB00>erentiate the <U+FB01>ndings based on whether the
questionnaire was completed by a mother or a father (Lu et al., 2014; Pont et al., 2009). However, empirical <U+FB01>ndings show that
mothers and fathers play di<U+FB00>erent roles in a family life. For instance, compared to fathers, mothers are more engaged in child care
(Chesley & Flood, 2017). With respect to PA, previous <U+FB01>ndings have shown that father and mother may in<U+FB02>uence their child's PA by
di<U+FB00>erent processes (Bois et al., 2005; Edwarson & Gorely, 2010). Mothers seems to o<U+FB00>er more logistic support to their children
whereas fathers are more prone to provide higher levels of explicit modelling, intentionally using their behaviour to encourage their
child to be physically active (Davison et al., 2003). Moreover, cultural values and social norms may also support and promote gender-
speci<U+FB01>c behaviours (Deaner, Balish and Lombardo, 2016) and therefore in<U+FB02>uence mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of and hence
barriers to di<U+FB00>erent modes of transport to school. Hence, it could be hypothesized that mothers and fathers have di<U+FB00>erent perceptions
of barriers to ACS and therefore may have di<U+FB00>erent in<U+FB02>uence on the actual commuting to school behaviours in children.
    The primary objective of this study was to compare mothers’ and fathers’ perceived barriers to ACS in a sample of Spanish
children. The secondary objective was to determine correlates of ACS from mothers’ and fathers’ perspective. The third objective was
to compare acceptable distances for children's walking and cycling to school from mothers’ and fathers’ perspectives. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the <U+FB01>rst study in which attention has turned to study mothers’ and fathers’ perspective on ACS in children.
Understanding potential di<U+FB00>erences in mothers’ and fathers’ barriers to ACS in children will provide valuable knowledge for de-
signing future ACS interventions which could successfully address gender-speci<U+FB01>c parental barriers.

2. Methods

2.1. Study design

    Data were collected as part of the CAPAS-City project (Centre for the Promotion of PA and Health) in Huesca (Spain) in 2017. One
of the main aims of this cross-cultural project between Spain and France deals with the analysis of children's ACS patterns and the
implementation of context-based strategies to promote ACS. Huesca is a mid-sized Spanish city placed in the north-east of Spain with
a population of 52,399 inhabitants who live in an urban area of 6.75 km2 (4.21 km2 when excluding an industrial area) with 7762.8
inhabitants/km2. The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee on Clinical Research of Aragon.

2.2. Participants

    All 12 primary schools in Huesca were invited to participate in this study through a personal meeting of researchers with the
headmaster of each school. Participating schools were asked to allow researchers to invite children from grades 4 to 6 (age: 9 to 12
years) and their parents to participate in this study. One school declined to participate. Thus, the <U+FB01>nal sample included 11 schools
(92% school participation rate; 7 state and 4 state-integrated schools), with a total population of 1,560 potential children partici-
pants.
    Researchers sent a letter to all potential children participants and their fathers and mothers to inform them about the project and
to invite them to participate in this study. Parents were given 3 to 4 days to consider the invitation and sign parental consent. Overall,
1,263 parents signed consent (80.96% participation rate). Children also signed their own consent before completing the

                                                                   142

questionnaire at school (100% participation rate). A total of 978 questionnaires from mothers and 833 questionnaires from fathers
were received (77.43% and 65.95% completion rates, respectively). After excluding incomplete or invalid children's and parental
questionnaires, and selecting only families in which all participants (i.e., child, father and mother) completed the study ques-
tionnaire, a sample of 649 families remained. In the next step, we excluded 59 families with divorced/separated parents who lived in
di<U+FB00>erent households and 127 households located > 3.5km from child's school (i.e. households located outside the urban area of
Huesca). Therefore, data from 463 families with complete and valid child's, mother's and father's questionnaires were included in the
analysis.

2.3. Procedure

    Data were collected from February to May 2017. Research team distributed children's questionnaires. Children <U+FB01>lled out the
questionnaire at school during one class period supervised by the class’ mentor teacher. Parental questionnaires for mothers and
fathers who had signed consent were given to children at school to take home along with an explanatory letter. Fathers and mothers
were asked to return completed questionnaires through standardized lines of communication at each school (e.g., direct return to
mentor teacher, attached to homework, etc.) within ten days.

2.4. Outcome measures

2.4.1. Sociodemographic characteristics
     Children self-reported their age and gender. Fathers and mothers self-reported their own age, education level (none, primary
school, secondary school, professional training or university) and employment status (employed or unemployed). Socioeconomic
status was calculated using the Family A<U+FB04>uence Scale II (FAS II, Currie et al., 2008) from the completed parental questionnaires. FAS
II is a four-item scale which allows to calculate a composite score ranging from 0 to 9 which was used in analyses. There were no
signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences in the sociodemographic characteristics between participants and families excluded from the analysis (e.g.,
excluded participants: children's gender, 48.5% females; children's age, 10.62 ± 0.97 years; mothers’ age, 42.43 ± 5.13; fathers’ age,
45.61 ± 5.41; mothers’ employed, 84.2%; fathers’ employed, 96.8%).

2.4.2. Commuting to and from school
    Children self-reported their mode of commuting to and from school for every weekday using the Mode and Frequency of
Commuting To and From School Questionnaire (Chillón et al., 2017). Mode of commuting to school was assessed using questions
"How do you travel to/from school on… (day of the week)?" with the response categories "car", "public bus", "motorbike", "school
bus", "bicycle", "on foot" and "other". Each journey to school (i.e., to and from school) for every day was categorized into (1) active (on
foot or by bicycle), or (0) passive (by car, public bus, school bus, motorcycle). After that, all weekly active trips were summed into a
single variable ranging from 0 to 10. Finally, a dichotomous variable ‘active commuters’ (=6 active trips per week) versus ‘passive
commuters’ to school (< 6 active trips per week) was calculated (Petruno<U+FB00> et al., 2013).
    Parents self-reported their own modes of commuting to work by responding to a question "How do you usually travel to work?"
with response categories being "car", "public bus", "motorbike", "bicycle", "on foot" and "other". Parents who walked or cycled to work
were categorized as ‘active commuters’ whereas those using a car, public bus or motorbike were categorized as ‘passive commuters’.

2.4.2.1. Distance from home to school. Household address was independently provided by children, fathers and mothers to avoid
spelling mistakes occasionally made by younger children. In case of spelling di<U+FB00>erences, the researchers checked the home address in
all three surveys and the street map of the city to con<U+FB01>rm the correct address. Google Maps software was used to calculate distance
from home to school for each family, selecting the shortest route on foot via the street network between each household and the main
school entrance.

2.4.2.2. Parental perceived barriers to ACS. Parental perceived barriers to ACS were assessed using a 23-item questionnaire (Chaufan
et al., 2012), developed from a previous parental barriers questionnaire (McDonald et al., 2011) and adapted to the Spanish cultural
context (Huertas-Delgado et al., 2017). Assessed barriers included perceived distance to school, tra<U+FB03>c, pedestrian and cycling
infrastructure, personal and tra<U+FB03>c safety, convenience, companionship, logistic requirements, child's interest in walking/cycling and
the weather. All items were assessed using a 4-point Likert scale ranging from (1) strongly disagree to (4) strongly agree. To calculate
the proportion of parents agreeing with each statement, 4-point Likert scale items were also recoded into ‘disagree’ (1 and 2) and
‘agree’ (3 and 4).

2.5. Statistical analysis

    Sociodemographic characteristics of children and parents were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Di<U+FB00>erences between mothers’
and fathers’ sociodemographic characteristics and perceived barriers to ACS were tested using independent samples t-test for con-
tinuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables. The threshold distance for active commuting was calculated using the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis based on the mode of commuting to school (‘active’ versus ‘passive’) and the
distance from home to school. Considering sensitivity and speci<U+FB01>city data of the test, the Younden Index was calculated (Schisterman
et al., 2005) to obtain the threshold distance that best discriminates ‘active commuters’ from ‘passive commuters’. The larger the area

under the ROC curve (ranking from 0 to 1), the more discriminatory is the test. The area under the curve values of .90 are considered
excellent, .80–.89 good, .70–.79 fair, and less than .70 poor (Metz, 1978).
    Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine multivariate correlates of children's ACS from mother's and father's
perspective separately. First, bivariate associations were examined between the mode of children’ commuting to school (as a de-
pendant variable) and each of the independent variables (child's age and gender, distance from home to school, type of school,
socioeconomic status, mother's/father's mode of commuting to work, mother's/father's level of education, mother's/father's age,
number of working parents in a family and mother's/father's perceived barriers to ACS (using 4-point Likert scale data)). All sig-
ni<U+FB01>cant univariate correlates (p < .05) were included into a multivariate binary logistic regression model. Separate models were
created for mothers and fathers including the total sample as well as parents living in households within the threshold ACS distance to
school determined using the ROC analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS Software Version 21.0 for Windows.
The level of signi<U+FB01>cance was set at p < .05.

3. Results

    Sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. Overall, 71.7% of children actively commuted to school including
46.6% boys and 65.7% of children enrolled in state schools. In the total sample, 375 (81.3%) households had two employed parents.
Compared to fathers, mothers were on average 2 years younger, had higher education and had higher rates of active commuting to
work (Table 1). Families with both parents employed also showed higher rates of active commuting to work in mothers (50.6%)
compared to fathers (40.9%).
    Perceived barriers for fathers and mothers are displayed in Table 2. The most common barrier to ACS reported by over two thirds
mothers and fathers was concern about the weight of the school bag. Over half of parents reported the lack of sidewalks or their poor
conditions, the lack of policemen at the road crossings, tra<U+FB03>c volume, tra<U+FB03>c speed and the lack of other children or adults cycling to
school as a barrier to ACS for their child. Compared to fathers, mothers reported signi<U+FB01>cantly higher rate of concern regarding the
lack of a policeman at the road crossings as a barrier to ACS in children. No other statistically signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences between fathers'
and mothers' perceived barriers to ACS were observed.
    The results of the binary logistic regression analysis conducted for mothers and fathers separately showed that for both parents a
positive correlate of child's ACS was active commuting of parents to their work whereas negative correlates were distance from home
to school and parental perception of convenience of driving rather than walking their child to school (Table 3). In addition, for
mothers only, mothers’ perceptions of child's extra-curricular activities organization before or after school were positively related to
child's ACS whereas mothers’ perception that it is boring for their child to walk to school was a negative correlate of ACS in children.
Mothers’ and fathers’ models explained approximately half of the variance in children's ACT (R2= .52 and R2= .49, respectively).
    To account for the e<U+FB00>ect of distance on ACS behaviours, ROC curve analysis was conducted to determine the threshold distance
for ACS in the study sample. The threshold ACS distance to school was 775 m (area under the curve: .855; p < .001). Overall, 293
children (63.3%) lived within this threshold ACS distance to school (51% boys, 89% active commuters, 72.4% students from state
schools). When binary logistic regression analysis was repeated in this subsample, only distance from home to school and parental
perceptions of convenience to drive their child to school remained statistically signi<U+FB01>cant as negative correlates of ACS in children

4. Discussion

    This study compared mothers’ and fathers’ barriers to ACS in a sample of Spanish children. Main <U+FB01>ndings showed that: (a)
although some barriers to children's ACS were similar for both parents (distance from home to school, perception of convenience of
driving children to school and parental mode of commuting to work), other perceived barriers were speci<U+FB01>c for mothers (perceptions
of child's extra-curricular activities organization and the children's lack of interest in walking to school) in the total study sample; (b)
when the barriers to ACS were analysed in families living within the walking distance to school (775 m in this sample), distance from
home to school and perception of convenience of driving emerged as signi<U+FB01>cant negative correlates whereas parental active mode of
commuting to work positively correlated with children's ACS from both mothers' and fathers' perspective and gender di<U+FB00>erences in
parental barriers to ACS were not present.
    In the multivariate analysis, signi<U+FB01>cant correlates of ACS for both mothers and fathers in this study included distance to school,
mode of parental commute to work and parental perceptions of the convenience of driving their child to school. Distance from home
to school is the strongest predictor of ACS in children and has been reported as one of the most frequent and in<U+FB02>uential environmental
barriers to ACS in children in multiple countries (Lu et al., 2014; Rodriguez and Vogt, 2009; Timperio et al., 2006). The threshold
walking distance for this sample is quite similar to another recent Spanish study (875 m in Rodriguez-López et al., 2017) but lower
than in other international studies (Chillón et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2009). Given that the shorter the distance between home to
school is associated with the higher likelihood of ACS in children (Galvez et al., 2010; Napier et al., 2011), our <U+FB01>ndings seems to be
consistent with those studies and other recent studies conducted in other cities in Spain where greater distances were associated with
lower rates of ACS (Huertas-Delgado et al., 2017; Villa-González et al., 2012). Hence, distance from home to school, and consequently
school location, should be considered as a key point in terms of policy implications (Tester, 2009; Voorhees et al., 2010). It should be
noted that Spanish national education policy allows parents to choose any school in their city, with no obligation to enrol their child

into the closest school. As reported in previous studies, the presence of school choice has signi<U+FB01>cant implications not only for ACS
(Mandic et al., 2017b), but also for education, health and sustainability (Mandic et al., 2017c). Feasibility of ACS should be con-
sidered as one of the main arguments for school location decisions (Tester, 2009). Education policies should also consider the wide
range of both positive and negative implications of school choice that extend beyond education (Mandic et al., 2017c).
    In the present study children's ACS was signi<U+FB01>cantly associated with mothers' and fathers' mode of commuting to work, which
seems to be consistent with previous studies (Henne et al., 2014). To our knowledge there are only a few studies which have analyzed
associations between parental and children's daily modes of commuting (Henne et al., 2014; Susilo and Liu, 2015). The <U+FB01>ndings from
the current study are not surprising considering the demanding scheduling commitments of modern families. Parental modelling of
active travel has been positively associated with ACS in adolescents (Carlson et al., 2014) and children's active travel mode on a daily

basis (Susilo and Liu, 2015). ACS could be understood as a type of logistic support provided by parents, which, in turn, has been
positively associated with higher levels of PA in children (Jago et al., 2011). In the present study children living within the walking
distance to school and whose mothers used an active mode of commuting to work had 10 times higher odds to ACS. Other studies
have shown that mothers usually o<U+FB00>er high levels of logistic support, often higher than fathers (Davison et al., 2003). Therefore, it is
possible that this study found 10 times higher odds to ACS because in Spain it is mothers who in most cases accompany their children
on the way to school. However, these <U+FB01>ndings need to be interpreted with caution given the small size of the city where this study was
conducted and further research is needed.
    Parental perception of driving being more convenient than walking their children to school emerged as a signi<U+FB01>cant perceived
barrier to ACS from both mothers’ and fathers’ perspective and was associated with a lower likelihood of children's ACS in this study.
Previous studies have also reported convenience of driving children to school as a major parental barrier to children's ACS in general
(Faulkner et al., 2010; MacDonald & Aalborg, 2009) as well as speci<U+FB01>cally for walking (Panter et al., 2010) and cycling to school
(Trapp et al., 2011). A recent study also reported that more than half of adolescents reported convenience of being driven to school as
a barrier to ACS (Mandic et al. 2017a). Therefore, parental perceptions of convenience of driving their children to school may also
in<U+FB02>uence children's preferences for di<U+FB00>erent modes of transport later in life. One review stated that convenience of car travel may be
related to cultural in<U+FB02>uences as well as structural factors (Lorenc et al., 2008). For instance, the need of busy-time families to ful<U+FB01>l
demanding scheduling commitments in children's afternoon may be one reason for the convenience of car use (Trapp et al., 2011).
However, in our study, mothers' perception of extra-curricular activities organization showed an unexpected positive association with
ACS in children. The small size of the city and the recent pedestrianisation process that occurred in the last few years in the city centre
(0.32 km2 pedestrianised; 7.6% of urbanised area) could explain this result (Mäki-Opas et al., 2016). Pedestrian areas may improve
accessibility to facilities, making easier for mothers to ful<U+FB01>l children's commitments on foot rather than using a private car.
Nevertheless, a multitude of factors related to family structure, decision-making and lifestyle choices could in<U+FB02>uence parental per-
ception of convenience (Trapp et al., 2011). Therefore, parental perception of the convenience of driving children to school is a
complex concept that should be further studied from a qualitative perspective to create better understanding of the underlying
characteristics and to design future interventions to minimize the convenience of driving as one of the parental barriers to children's
ACS.
    In the present study, organization related to children's extra-curricular activities before and after school was a positive correlate of
ACS from mothers’ perspective. This <U+FB01>nding needs to be further examined taking into consideration gender di<U+FB00>erences in child care
responsibilities (Roeters and Gracia, 2016). Previous studies have shown that, compared to fathers, mothers were disproportionally
more engaged in routine child care (Chesley & Flood, 2017, O<U+FB00>er, 2014), using the car to manage complex daily routines and to
implement notions of what constitutes being a good mother (Dowling, 2000). Our <U+FB01>ndings seem to indicate that mothers also play a
key role in children's commuting to school behaviours, which could contribute to further understanding of the subtle dimensions of
the unequal division of childcare by gender (O<U+FB00>er, 2014). However, it is important to note that signi<U+FB01>cant correlates of children's ACS
from mothers’ and fathers’ were similar for both parents and did not include extra-curricular activities when analysed in the sample of
families that lived within a walkable distance to school. Therefore, interventions programs to promote ACS should consider the key
role of mothers and be based on family-friendly strategies that address promotion of ACS from a gender equality perspective,
especially when designing interventions for children living further away from school (Roeters and Gracia, 2016). For instance,
following a participatory approach, parental child care workshops could be organised to discuss about how parents could manage
their child care time to promote ACS as much as possible.
    The major strength of this study is the high school participation rate in one city (11 out of 12 schools; 92%) and the approach
followed to analyze the associations of parental barriers on ACS in children considering mothers' and fathers' perspectives in-
dependently. Nevertheless, this study has several limitations including common limitations related to self-reported data and limited
reliability of items used to assess mothers' and fathers' perceived barriers to ACS (MacDonald et al., 2011). In addition, our sample
included only families with both parents living in the same household. Therefore, our <U+FB01>ndings may not be generalizable to other
family contexts (with divorced, separated, or single parents) that are becoming more common nowadays. Moreover, we cannot
exclude a possibility that mother and father completed the questionnaire together which could in<U+FB02>uence the reported results. Finally,
these <U+FB01>ndings may not be generalizable to other urban or rural areas of Spain or internationally. Therefore, further research in
di<U+FB00>erent urban, rural and cultural contexts is warranted.

5. Conclusions

    This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the speci<U+FB01>c correlates of mothers’ and fathers’ perspectives on ACS in
children. The present study reveals that from both mothers’ and fathers’ perspective the negative correlates of children's ACS were
distance from home to school and parental perception of the convenience of driving their child to school whereas a positive correlate
was parental active commuting to work behaviours. In addition, mothers-speci<U+FB01>c correlates of ACS included a positive association
with children's extra-curricular activities organization and a negative association with the lack of child's interest in walking to school.
However, gender di<U+FB00>erences in parental perceptions were not present among families living within a walking distance to school.
These <U+FB01>ndings reinforce the idea that the design of future interventions for promoting ACS in children should consider the mother-
and father-speci<U+FB01>c barriers to ACS and be based on family-friendly strategies which respect a gender equality perspective. Addressing
built and social environmental factors that a<U+FB00>ects both mothers' and fathers' perspective might directly contribute to increase rates of
ACT in children. Finally, due to the fact that parents' cognitive, behavioural and a<U+FB00>ective responses to children's behaviour seem to be
cross-culturally di<U+FB00>erent (Bornstein et al., 2011), further research is warranted in order to investigate whether mothers' and fathers'
