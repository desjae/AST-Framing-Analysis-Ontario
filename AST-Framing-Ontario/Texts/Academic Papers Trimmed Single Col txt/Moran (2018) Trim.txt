1. Introduction

    In recent decades, the adverse health e<U+FB00>ects of sedentary life-style (Biswas et al., 2015) along with the negative environmental
impact of increasing car use (Frank et al., 2003) has led to intensive investment in active mobility as part of a wider urban health
agenda (Corburn et al., 2004). Amongst the various types of active mobility, walking may be the easiest to adopt and adhere to, as it
has zero cost and requires no special skills or equipment. Walking for transport has positive health impacts throughout the lifespan
(Scheepers et al., 2014) and especially during childhood, given the high and rising prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity
worldwide (Gupta et al., 2012; Lobstein et al., 2004). Replacing car-trips with walking is highly bene<U+FB01>cial for children because it
decreases car-pedestrian con<U+FB02>icts (Lyon and Persaud, 2002) as well as tra<U+FB03>c-related pollution, to which children are highly sensitive
(Jerrett et al., 2008; Schwartz, 2004). Furthermore, children’s walking contributes to their socio-emotional development by positively

a<U+FB00>ecting their independence and improving self-image and social ties (Kingham and Ussher, 2007).
    Despite its clear bene<U+FB01>ts, children’s active mobility and walking for transport has been decreasing over the years throughout the
world. In the USA between 1969 and 2009, the percent of children walking or biking to school dropped from 40.7% to 12.7%
(McDonald et al., 2011). In Australia, the percent of children who walked to school dropped from 57.7% in 1971 to 25.5% in
1999–2003 (Van der Ploeg et al., 2008). These trends have been attributed to various factors, such as: increased car reliance, low
access to schools, and low-density suburban development (Frank et al., 2003).
    Neighborhood characteristics play an important role in enhancing active mobility. Accumulating empirical evidence supports the
role of the physical environment in enhancing active mobility and transportation walking in particular (Saelens and Handy, 2008;
Sallis et al., 2012). Walking was found to be more common in inner-cities compared to suburban neighborhoods (Khattak and
Rodríguez, 2005). Among general populations as well as among children, walking has been linked to high walkability (Owen et al.,
2007) and other walkability-related characteristics, such as street connectivity (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Sugiyama et al., 2012),
residential density (Carlson et al., 2014), land-use mix/access to destinations (Koohsari et al., 2014; Lee and Moudon, 2006) and
sidewalks (Boarnet et al., 2005; Sugiyama et al., 2012).
    In addition to neighborhood characteristics, routes attributes play an important role in shaping pedestrians’ experience. However,
to date, most of studies have focused on neighborhood in<U+FB02>uences on walking (whether by using external aerial units or home-based
bu<U+FB00>ers) and only recently studies have begun to focus on more micro-scale environmental in<U+FB02>uences. Amongst these, some studies
focused on the actual routes taken by individuals (henceforth: chosen routes) by employing quantitative (Millward et al., 2013),
qualitative (Carroll et al., 2015; Van Cauwenberg et al., 2012) or mixed methodologies (Moran et al., 2017). Other studies relied on
proxy measures of journeys, consisting of modelled routes that represent the shortest/most direct street-network itinerary between
predetermined destinations (e.g., Dalton et al., 2015; Karusisi et al., 2014). While modelled routes were found to be reliable proxy
measures (Duncan and Mummery, 2007), the study of chosen routes is essential to the understanding of environment-behavior
associations. Ultimately, comparing chosen and non-chosen routes provides valuable insights on environment-behavior interactions
and route-choice considerations. This type of comparison has been increasingly used in route choice modelling studies (e.g., Buliung
et al., 2013; Harrison et al., 2014; Rodríguez et al., 2015; Tribby et al., 2017; Winter et al., 2010) not only because of its potential to
partially overcome concerns about self-selection, but also because of its intuitive appeal, as routes are the way through which
pedestrians’ experience and relate to the built environment.
    Results of studies on route decisions support and further extend previous work by that was largely done at the neighborhood level.
Speci<U+FB01>cally, routes were found more likely to be used if the environment along them was characterized by high levels of density
(Dalton et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2012), access to destinations (Gallimore et al., 2011; Rodríguez et al., 2015) and aesthetics (Dessing
et al., 2016). However, route-level studies have also revealed new environmental features related to walking that were less reported
at the neighborhood level, such as urban waterscape (Dessing et al., 2016; Moran et al., 2017), openness of streetscapes (Van
Cauwenberg et al., 2012), and tra<U+FB03>c control features (Rodríguez et al., 2015).
    To summarize, attributes of the built environment measured at the neighborhood and route levels have been associated with
walking behaviors. However, the vast majority of previous studies have focused on either neighborhoods or routes but haven’t
examined the synergistic e<U+FB00>ect between both. Walkable routes in a sea of suburbs are likely to in<U+FB02>uence behaviors di<U+FB00>erently than
similar routes in a similarly walkable environment. These interactions are important, as they provide cues to pedestrians about the
feasibility of reaching other potential destinations through trip chaining, and of using di<U+FB00>erent routes to reach desired destinations.
Furthermore, most studies examining route choices have focused on trips to prominent destinations (e.g., home to work, or for
children, home to school trips), even though these remain a minority of trips undertaken during a given day and thus fail to represent
other routine/discretionary trips that may occur. Given the expectations and emerging evidence that environmental in<U+FB02>uences on
physical activity are likely to be context-speci<U+FB01>c (Saelens and Handy, 2008; Giled Corti et al., 2005), it is reasonable to expect that
route-choice considerations may also vary by context (trips location and purpose). The current study <U+FB01>lls this gap in the literature by
investigating associations between the built environment and children’s route choices, while addressing di<U+FB00>erences in location and
neighborhood characteristics (inner-city vs clustered suburban neighborhoods) and destinations (school, public facility, park, retail).
The main questions posed in this research are: What are the associations between route-level environmental attributes and children’s
route choice? and - Do these associations vary by the journey’s destination and general location?

2. Methodology

2.1. Study area and participants

   The study was conducted in the city of Rishon LeZion, the fourth largest city in Israel (243,323 inhabitants), located along the
central Israeli Coastline plain, 12 km south of Tel Aviv. Two distinct urban areas were selected, broadly characterized by high built
footprint, land-use mix and grid street network (henceforth: Inner-city), and by the presence of high rises with undeveloped and
parking spaces surrounding them, resulting in a low built footprint, segregated land uses and limited street connectivity (henceforth:
Suburban). The two areas were also chosen so as to have similar socio-economic indicators. For sampling purposes, <U+FB01>ve neighbor-
hoods were chosen, of which two neighborhoods were located in the inner-city and three were located in the suburban area. A <U+FB01>gure
ground map of the study area (Fig. 1) shows di<U+FB00>erences between the inner-city and suburban areas. These di<U+FB00>erences can also be seen

in the street realm, with the inner city having narrower streets, lower building setbacks, and continuous building fronts compared to
the suburban area (Fig. 2)
    Israel o<U+FB00>ers a unique and intriguing setting for this study. First, in Israel, as in many other countries, recent decades have been
characterized by high and rising prevalence of physical inactivity, overweight and obesity among children and adults (Gross et al.,
2009; Lissau et al., 2004; She<U+FB00>er and Calderon-Margalit, 2007). These changes were accompanied by increased car-reliance and
suburban sprawl development (Frenkel, 2004; Tzafrir-Reoven, 2006), which are particularly challenging in Israel due to its increasing
population con<U+FB01>ned to the country’s limited land availability. Correspondingly, while the common form of housing in north-
American and Australian suburbs is single detached houses, the Israeli suburb is likely to include high-rise residential buildings
nested within a conventional suburban layout. This enables Israel suburbs to accommodate high densities, despite their suburban
layout, consisting of land use segregation and low built-footprint and street connectivity. Such high-density suburbs are also illu-
strated in our study area as presented in Table 1. For example, the two suburban neighborhoods “Neot Ashalim” and “Neot Shikma”
have relatively low intersection densities alongside with high residential densities (nearly as high as in the inner-city).
    In addition to the built environment variables, Table 1 presents socioeconomic indicators at the neighborhood level, indicating
that residents of both neighborhood types share similar socioeconomic characteristics, except for household car ownership which was
slightly higher in suburban neighborhoods. This highlights another unique aspect of this study setting - the upper-middle class
characteristics of inner-city residents, which is less common in other areas around the world, and especially in the USA, where inner-
city is often associated with poverty.

2.2. Identifying routes walked

    Data collection took place in school days during May-June 2011, and included participants’ documentation of routes along which
they regularly walk from their home to four common destinations – schools, public facilities (e.g., libraries, community centers),
retail and park destinations.
    A total of eleven schools were identi<U+FB01>ed within the study area. Among these, <U+FB01>ve were selected to participate (one school per
neighborhood) based on their enrollment zone and on the principals’ agreement to participate. Within each school, 5th and 6th
graders were recruited to participate in a route mapping exercise. Participants were provided with a street map of their neighborhood
(photocopied in black and white on a letter-sized sheet of paper), upon which they were brie<U+FB02>y instructed to mark their home, four
di<U+FB00>erent destinations to which they regularly walk, and the routes that they most frequently use when walking to those destinations.
The four destinations included the school they attend and three types of local destinations that participants regularly walked to on
weekdays during the afternoon, including retail destinations (e.g., grocery stores, shops, shopping centers), green open space (e.g.,
parks, playgrounds) and public facilities (i.e., community centers, libraries). No further instructions were given, except for clar-
i<U+FB01>cations as needed. These simple instructions, followed by minimal communication between the researcher and the participants,
served to ensure that the route drawing task will be done as authentically as possible and to avoid potential biases that may otherwise
be introduced. The route drawing activity lasted approximately 30 min, occurred during school hours in small groups of up to seven
children and was facilitated by the <U+FB01>rst author. Although this activity was conducted in small groups, each participant completed the
procedure individually. To avoid interactions and mutual in<U+FB02>uences among participants, it was clearly stated that this was an
individual activity that each participant needs to complete on his/her own.
    Prior to data collection, school principals and teachers were provided with information regarding the study, and consent forms
were delivered to the children’s parents through the school. Children participated in this study only after providing a signed informed
consent from their parents. Ethics approval for this study was received from the Technion Ethics Committee and from the Israeli
ministry of Education.

2.3. Preparation of geographic data

2.3.1. Route identi<U+FB01>cation
    The routes drawn on paper were digitized into GIS. First, the origins (participants’ homes) and destinations (school, public
facility, retail, and green open space) were geocoded to create a GIS point shape<U+FB01>le. An aerial photo was used to adjust the desti-
nations’ locations to the main entrance from which the participants walked. These point shape<U+FB01>les were then used to create polyline
shape<U+FB01>les of the routes. Reported routes were manually digitized into GIS based on the drawn maps, the point shape<U+FB01>les, the street
network layer and an aerial photo.
    Alternative routes were generated using the Network Analyst tool included in ArcGIS 10.1, using the point shape<U+FB01>le and city’s
street network layer to calculate the shortest route between each pair of origin and destination based on the street and alley network
available from the Municipality of Rishon LeZion. Although this approach aimed at identifying the shortest path, it is possible that
some routes chosen by participants were even shorter than the routes identi<U+FB01>ed here. This occurred when the chosen route cut
through areas with large lots (parking lots, parks, schools). Given the importance of distance in determining route choices, it is not
surprising to <U+FB01>nd considerable overlap between the route chosen and the modelled routes. To further characterize the distance
di<U+FB00>erences between the routes, we used the overlap measure suggested by Harrison et al. (2014) by calculating both the percentage
of the modelled route that fell within a 25-m bu<U+FB00>er of the chosen routes and the percentage of the chosen route that fell within a 25-m
bu<U+FB00>er of the modelled route. Because the two were highly correlated (r = 0.97, p < .0001), we used the latter in the current
analysis. To illustrate, the overlap variable used in this study represents the percentage of the chosen route that falls within 25 m of
the modelled route. For example, a value of 0% is indicates that there is no overlap between the chosen route and the modelled route,
50% indicates that half of the chosen route falls within 25 m of the modelled route, and 100% indicates that all of the chosen route
“falls” within 25 m of the modelled route.

2.3.2. Built environment characteristics of the routes
    We calculated measures of the built environment within a 25-meter bu<U+FB00>er area along each route (chosen or modelled). This bu<U+FB00>er
size was found to provide a good representation of en-route pedestrian exposure, as it contained similar proportions of street in-
frastructure (roads and sidewalks) and other adjacent land uses (e.g., buildings, setbacks, parks). On average, route bu<U+FB00>ers of 25 m
included 37% street infrastructure (roads and sidewalks), compared to 15- and 50-m routes bu<U+FB00>ers that included 49% and 26% roads,
respectively. No di<U+FB00>erences were observed between the two neighborhood types and the four trip destinations.
    GIS data was provided by the Municipality of Rishon LeZion. Several built environment variables were calculated proportionally
to the route’s bu<U+FB00>er area as follows:
    Urban form variables: (1) Intersection density – the ratio of the number of intersections to the routes’ length; (2) Average re-
sidential density – the average number of households per residential building along the route; (3) Average building height – the




                                                                  67

M.R. Moran et al.                                                                                   Transportation Research Part D 65 (2018) 63–81


average height (in meters) of buildings along the route; (4) Average lot coverage – the average ratio of buildings’ footprint area to the
buildings’ lot area; (5) Floor area ratio (FAR) – the average ratio between the gross <U+FB02>oor area of buildings to the total area of the
buildings’ lot regardless of the land use.
    Land use variables: Four land use variables were calculated, consisting of the proportion (in percentages) of land area within the
bu<U+FB00>er area dedicated to each of the following uses (1) residential; (2) retail (malls, stores, and mixed use buildings including retail
located below residential units); (3) public facilities (e.g., community centers, libraries, museums, health services, and mixed use
buildings including public facilities located below residential units); and (4) green open spaces (e.g., parks, playgrounds, trails, green
open areas).
    Walkability index: Walkability is de<U+FB01>ned as overall support for pedestrian travel and has been measured at both neighborhood and
route scales by using di<U+FB00>erent approaches. At the neighborhood scale, high walkability is often marked by high levels of density, land
used mixed and interconnected street networks (Owen et al., 2007), while at the route scale, walkability has been measured by
sidewalk quality, safety and legibility (Brook<U+FB01>eld and Tilley, 2016). In this study, as well as in a preceding study (Moran et al.,
2017b), we adopt the neighborhood approach to de<U+FB01>ne route level walkability by using the walkability index developed by Frank
et al. (2010), which is calculated based upon indicators of land-use mix, residential density and intersection density.

2.4. Data analysis

    Data analysis was performed with SPSS (version 21), EXCEL and GIS (ESRI ArcGIS 9.3). Descriptive statistics for chosen and
modelled routes overall, by neighborhood type and by trip destination were calculated. Statistical signi<U+FB01>cance of comparisons across
neighborhood type was determined using t-tests. Descriptive statistics of the route characteristics are provided in Appendix A.
    Preliminary analysis to determine the overlap between chosen and modelled routes was performed using the aforementioned (in
Section 2.3.1) overlap variable developed by Harrison et al. (2014). The overlap variable was then used to compute a path size
variable, which was added to regression models as described below.
    To answer the research questions, we used conditional logistic regression, which enables predicting route choice by comparing
one-to-one matched pairs of chosen and modelled routes. These models estimate the chances of taking the chosen route (versus the
modelled one) based on the values of independent variables (the built environment along both routes). First, the association of each
environmental attribute and route choice was examined separately, while adjusting only for distance and the degree of commonality
among routes as calculated by a path size variable following the speci<U+FB01>cation suggested by Bovy et al. (2008). This resulted in
adjusted bivariate associations, which were calculated for the pooled sample, by neighborhood type and by trip destinations. Second,
based on these bivariate results, variables were selected for multivariate models that were also adjusted for participants’ age and
gender. The multivariate models included environmental attributes that were most strongly associated with route choice (p-
value < .05) in the bivariate analysis, and that were not highly collinear (VIF < 2.5). Pairs of chosen and modelled routes that
coincide were eliminated from the sample as they do not re<U+FB02>ect route choice. To ease interpretation, the variables for lot coverage,
FAR and all land use variables were re-scaled by multiplying their original values by 100. Finally, to determine strength of asso-
ciation, all independent variables were standardized (mean zero and standard deviation one) and the <U+FB01>nal models re-estimated.
Conventional level of p = .05 was taken to represent statistical signi<U+FB01>cance when interpreting model results.

3. Results

3.1. Participants and route characteristics

   Participants were evenly distributed across gender, age (grade) and neighborhood type. A total of 107 children were recruited, of
which <U+FB01>fty lived in inner-city and <U+FB01>fty-seven lived in suburban neighborhoods. A similar number of boys and girls participated in the

study (50 and 57, respectively). Fifty-nine children were 5th graders, and the remaining forty-eight were 6th graders. All of the route
destinations were within the participants’ home neighborhood, and participants lived in a variety of di<U+FB00>erent locations within the
schools’ catchment areas, which covered about a half of the neighborhood area.
    Across all participants 348 routes were reported. While participants were instructed to describe routes to four destinations, the
number of routes per participant ranged from one to seven. The number and proportion of participants who described more than four
routes was signi<U+FB01>cantly higher in inner-city compared to suburban neighborhoods (24% vs 14%). Overall, most of the routes were
evenly distributed across neighborhoods and destinations (Table 2), as well as by gender and grade (results not reported). It should be
noted that prior to the analysis, 119 pairs of chosen-modelled routes were excluded, in which the participants chose the modelled
routes (in those cases the value of the overlap variable was 1.00, re<U+FB02>ecting an overlap of 100% between the routes).
    Appendix A contains descriptive statistics of all environmental variables along both chosen and modelled routes. The average
length of chosen routes in the pooled sample was 525.32 m, with the routes to public facilities being the longest (601.88 m), followed
by routes to parks (544.85 m), to school (497.75 m), and to retail (449.85 m). While route length did not di<U+FB00>er by neighborhood type
in the pooled sample, routes to school were signi<U+FB01>cantly longer in suburban compared to inner-city neighborhoods (562.31 vs.
402.11, p = .023). Chosen (as well as modelled) routes seem to be accurate re<U+FB02>ections of the built environments in which they are
located, and thus highlight di<U+FB00>erences between the two neighborhood types (Appendix A). Compared to those in suburban neigh-
borhoods, chosen routes in the inner-city had attributes associate with a more compact urban form, such as higher residential density
(M = 561.97 vs M = 182.54, t = 19.91, p < .0001), building height (M = 4.95 vs M = 2.07, t = 20.38, p < .0001), built footprint
(M = 35.09 vs M = 16.97, t = 19.67, p = .0001), FAR (M = 136.99 vs M = 89.32, t = 20.38, p < .0001) and a walkability index
(M = 0.12 vs M = -0.56, t = 5.27, p < .0001). Inner-city chosen routes also had more residential (M = 68.87 vs M = 56.82,
t = 6.34, p < .0001) and retail land uses (M = 11.33 vs M = 5.77, t = 4.27, p < .0001), but less green open spaces along the route
(M = 5.27 vs M = 20.71, t = -11.86, p < .0001). Similar di<U+FB00>erences were observed for modelled routes in inner-city and suburban
neighborhoods (results not shown).

3.2. Comparability between chosen and modelled routes

    Appendix B presents descriptive statistics of the overlap measure in the pooled route sample (median, IQR, mean, SD). On
average, chosen and modelled routes overlapped by 64% in the pooled sample, indicating that on average 64% of chosen routes fell
within 25 m of their alternative modelled route and the remaining 36% fell elsewhere. This average overlap was slightly, but not
signi<U+FB01>cantly, higher in inner-city compared to suburban neighborhoods (67% vs 61%). These di<U+FB00>erences increased and turned
signi<U+FB01>cant when looking at routes to schools (77% vs 55%, t = 2.78, p = .006) and to public facilities (and 68% vs 52%, t = -2.22,
p = .029). Although the overlap did not vary signi<U+FB01>cantly by the route’s destination, descriptive comparisons across the four des-
tinations yielded di<U+FB00>erent results for the two neighborhood types. In the inner-city, the average overlap was greatest in routes to
school (77%), followed by routes to public facilities (68%), retail (66%) and parks (63%). However, this was not the case in suburban
neighborhoods, where the average overlap was greatest in routes to parks (69%), followed by routes to retail (66%), schools (55%),
and public facilities (52%).
    Chosen routes were consistently longer than those modelled (Appendix A). In the pooled sample chosen routes were 8.5% longer
than those modelled in GIS. This gap was slightly greater in inner-city compared to suburban neighborhoods (9.84% vs 7.33%). The
average length gap between chosen and modelled routes was greatest in routes to parks (9.6%), followed by routes to public facilities
(8.9%), to retail (8.5%) and to school (6.3%).
    It should be noted that 18% of the chosen routes (n = 63) were shorter than their modelled alternative. These routes passed
through areas not included in the city’s street network layer, such as: parking lots (n = 40), parks and private area (n = 11), trails
(n = 6) and schools (n = 6). Interestingly, some of these (supposedly) short-cuts varied by neighborhood type, as cutting through
parking lots was more common in suburban neighborhoods (33 vs 7), while cutting through school parcels was mostly common in
inner-city neighborhoods (5 vs 1).

3.3. Route choice as a function of route environmental attributes

   Tables 3–5 show the adjusted-bivariate and multivariate associations between route choice and route characteristics in the pooled
sample, by neighborhood type, and by trip destination, respectively.

3.3.1. Bivariate associations
    According to the adjusted-bivariate analysis in the pooled sample (Table 3), participants chose routes with lower intersection
density (OR = 0.83, CI = 0.77–0.89), but higher values of the other urban form measures, including: Building height (OR = 3.48,
CI = 2.36–5.13), lot coverage (OR = 1.13, CI = 1.08–1.19), FAR (OR = 1.04, CI = 1.03–1.05) and residential density (OR = 1.01,
CI = 1.007–1.014). Compared to modelled routes, routes chosen by participants contained more retail and residential land uses
(OR = 1.06, CI = 1.02–1.10 and OR = 1.02, CI = 1.001–1.1034, respectively), but fewer public facilities (OR = 0.96,
CI = 0.93–0.98) and green open spaces (OR = 0.97, CI = 0.95–0.99). No signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erences were observed between chosen and

modelled routes in terms of the composite measure of walkability.
    Consistent with the results from the pooled sample, the adjusted-bivariate analysis by neighborhood type shows that com-
pared to those modelled, chosen routes had lower intersection density, but were longer and had more compact urban form en-
route, i.e., higher values of residential density, building height, lot coverage and FAR (Table 4). Interestingly, the walkability
index and residential land use variables were associated with route choice in opposite directions in the two neighborhood types.
To illustrate, inner-city participants chose routes that passed through areas with higher walkability (OR = 1.76, CI = 1.04–2.98)
and fewer residential land uses (OR = 0.97, CI = 0.94–0.99), while suburban participants chose routes that were less walkable
(OR = 0.51, CI = 0.33–0.78) and passed through more residential areas (OR = 1.06, CI = 1.03–1.08). Additionally,
some exposures di<U+FB00>ered signi<U+FB01>cantly between chosen and modelled routes only in suburban neighborhoods (residential
density, public facility uses en-route), while other exposure di<U+FB00>ered signi<U+FB01>cantly only in inner-city neighborhoods (retail uses
en-route).
    Table 5 shows the same associations but by destination. Bivariate <U+FB01>ndings suggest that for nearly all destinations, chosen (versus
modelled) routes had lower intersection density and higher values of residential density, building height, lot coverage and FAR.
While these <U+FB01>ndings are in line with those in the pooled sample and the neighborhood analysis (Tables 3 and 4, respectively), the
results for other attributes were less consistent across destinations. For example, compared to modelled routes, residential land uses
were more common along chosen routes to schools and to public facilities (OR = 1.11, CI = 1.04–1.86 and OR = 1.04,
CI = 1.004–1.08, respectively), but less common along chosen routes to retail (OR = 0.94, CI = 0.91–0.98). Also, some attributes
were found to be associated with route choice to certain, but not all destinations. For example, trips to retail were signi<U+FB01>cantly
positively related to the percent of retail area en-route (OR = 1.24, CI = 1.10–1.40), and trips to school and to public facilities were
signi<U+FB01>cantly negatively related to the walkability index en-route (OR = 0.21, CI = 0.07–0.61 and OR = 0.52, CI = 0.29–0.94, re-
spectively). While the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>nding regarding retail is tautological, the latter <U+FB01>ndings are worthy of notice. Overall, these <U+FB01>ndings

suggest that in addition to route-level environmental attributes, destinations may also exert an in<U+FB02>uence on whether route attributes
impact route decisions.


3.3.2. Multivariate associations between route choice and route environmental attributes
    Results for the pooled sample (Table 3) suggest that route choice was most strongly predicted by intersection density (OR = 0.87,
CI = 0.81–0.94), followed by FAR (OR = 1.044, CI = 1.03–1.06) and the route length (OR = 1.012, CI = 1.007–1.017). Land uses
en-route were no longer signi<U+FB01>cantly related to route choice in the pooled sample. It should be noted that the route’s length and
intersection density remained signi<U+FB01>cant predictors of route choice in both neighborhood types, as well as in most of the destinations.
    Route choices in inner city trips were associated with intersection density (OR = 0.68, CI = 0.57–0.83), % retail (OR = 1.14,
CI = 1.03–1.26) and route length (OR = 1.017, CI = 1.007–1.026), while in suburban neighborhoods, route choice was associated
with building height (OR = 8.78, CI = 2.92–26.43), intersection density (OR = 0.86, CI = 0.81–0.99), % public facility (OR = 0.93,
CI = 0.87–0.99) and route length (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.007–1.024).
    By destination, route choice for trips to retail was associated with % retail (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.007–1.351) and the route’s length
(OR = 1.015, CI = 1.004–1.026). Route choice for trips to public facilities was associated with intersection density (OR = 0.82,
CI = 0.70–0.96), FAR (OR = 1.057, CI = 1.026–1.088) and the route length (OR = 1.014, CI = 1.002–1.026), with length having
the strongest e<U+FB00>ect on route choice, followed by FAR and intersection density (results not shown). For trips to school and to parks,
route choice was associated with FAR (OR = 1.14, CI = 1.04–1.25 and OR = 1.04, CI = 1.02–1.07, respectively) and route length
(OR = 1.03, CI = 1.005–1.058 and OR = 1.011, CI = 1.002–1.021, respectively).

4. Discussion

    Examining the environment along walking routes has been identi<U+FB01>ed as a promising approach to explore environmental in<U+FB02>u-
ences on walking behavior. While the literature of children’s route choice has largely focused on routes to school, in this study, we
investigate children’s walking route choices across di<U+FB00>erent locations (inner-city vs suburban areas) and trip destinations (school,
public facility, park, retail) in the context of a medium-sized Israeli city. By doing this, the current study extends existing literature
and allows a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of children’s route choice.
    Results regarding length appeared initially surprising given prior evidence suggesting that pedestrians are highly sensitive to
distance (Yang et al., 2012; Rodríguez and Joo, 2004). We found that as the length of a route increased, the odds of selecting it
increased. This can be explained by the way that the route choice set was constructed in this study. Cases in which participants took
the modelled path were excluded because we could not identify a comparison, non-taken route. Individuals who took a longer route
than the one modelled were included in the sample. Also included were a few participants (18%) who picked a route that was shorter
than the shortest route because they took shortcuts through parking lots, trails etc. This is re<U+FB02>ected in the fact that the average length
of routes selected was greater than the length of the non-taken shortest path (Appendix A). Hence, this result has to do more with how
the comparison routes were constructed than with children actively going out of their way to walk longer distances. The fact that
taking shortcuts through parking lots, was relatively common in suburban neighborhoods raises intriguing questions about pedestrian
safety because of the high injury risk that pedestrians face in those locations (Brison et al., 1988). The <U+FB01>ndings merit consideration of
interventions in parking lots where pedestrian exposure is high, for example by providing alternative paths adjacent to parking lots,
providing better marked paths, and improving visibility.
    Our <U+FB01>ndings suggest that some environmental attributes are consistently associated with route choice, while others have varying
and opposite e<U+FB00>ects on route choices across di<U+FB00>erent destinations and locations. In the majority of locations and destinations,
children chose routes with signi<U+FB01>cantly lower intersection density, but more compact urban form (as represented by higher values of
FAR and building height). These <U+FB01>ndings are in line with and further extend previous studies by showing that urban form is not only

associated with walking (Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Carlson et al., 2014; Lee and Moudon, 2006), but also with the choice of walking
route. From a more practical perspective, these <U+FB01>ndings pose a challenge for planners and developers as the aforementioned variables
tend to coexist with high rather than low intersection density. A possible strategy to overcome this challenge is to make intersections
safer for pedestrians, for example by adding tra<U+FB03>c lights, elevated and well painted crossing, railing etc.
    Our <U+FB01>ndings regarding intersection density run counter to previous studies associating high intersection density with children’s
walking behavior (e.g., Giles-Corti et al., 2011; Koohsari et al., 2014), other studies suggesting fewer intersections may be safer (Yu,
2015), and even to studies derived from a similar study population and setting (Moran et al., 2016). However, while these studies
focused on walking behavior as a mode choice (e.g., Khattak and Rodríguez, 2005; Schlossberg et al., 2006), the current study focuses
on pedestrians’ route choice. A possible explanation may be related to safety and/or way<U+FB01>nding considerations. It may be that
children choose routes with less intersections in order to avoid car-pedestrian encounters. Rodríguez et al. (2015) found that routes
that had more tra<U+FB03>c control devices, less tra<U+FB03>c, and more pedestrian safety amenities were preferred by adolescent girls that walk.
From a way<U+FB01>nding perspective, routes with less intersections may be more easily planned, learned and memorized. It is also very
likely that the di<U+FB00>erent scales used across studies may also explain the di<U+FB00>ering results regarding intersection density. To date, the
majority of evidence suggesting positive associations between intersection density and walking behaviors have used area-based
metrics (Frank et al., 2005, 2008; Koohsari et al., 2014; Owen et al., 2007). These <U+FB01>ndings conform with theoretical expectations that
connectivity decreases distance and provides variety of choices. However, like the current study, other studies focused at the route
level (e.g., Buliung et al., 2013) also have found opposite results. This discrepancy may be pointing to an ecological paradox: At the
level of an area (like a neighborhood) connectivity is positively associated with walking, but at the individual level, as individuals
seek to choose routes to complete a walking trip, connectivity detracts from walking. These di<U+FB00>erent speculative explanations are not
mutual exclusive and could be fruitfully explored in future research in di<U+FB00>erent settings and populations.
    Unlike intersection density and the other urban form variables, land use variables had fewer, weaker and less consistent asso-
ciations with route choice in multivariate analysis across the majority of destinations and locations. These <U+FB01>ndings complement
previously published data from the same study area (Moran et al., 2016), suggesting that children’s self-reported walking for
transportation was found to be more strongly associated with objectively measured urban form than it was with land use variables.
The current study supports and further extends these <U+FB01>ndings by suggesting that, compared to land uses, compact urban form is more
strongly associated not only with whether and/or how frequently children walk, but rather also with where children choose to walk.
    A similar pattern emerged in our results concerning green open space. In the current study, route choice was not associated with
green open space along the route, regardless of the route’s destination and/or location. These <U+FB01>ndings are consistent with, and add to,
previous <U+FB01>ndings from this setting pointing at null associations between green open space and children’s reported walking (Moran
et al., 2017b). However, they do di<U+FB00>er with <U+FB01>ndings for adolescent girls, who were more likely to select walking routes with parks
(Rodríguez et al., 2015). Given that these <U+FB01>ndings are all from limited settings, future research in di<U+FB00>erent settings is needed in order
to decide whether these <U+FB01>ndings are generalizable, or simply re<U+FB02>ect unique local conditions. Either way, the current and previous
<U+FB01>ndings suggest further investigation regarding the well-established role of green open space in enhancing walking (Larsen et al.,
2012; Sugiyama et al., 2009), and in pedestrian route choice (Moran et al., 2017; Rodríguez et al., 2015; Van Cauwenberg et al.,
2012).
    A few di<U+FB00>erences emerged across the di<U+FB00>erent multivariate models, suggesting that intersection density was the strongest pre-
dictor of route choice in inner-city neighborhoods, building height was the strongest predictor in suburban neighborhoods, FAR in
routes to school, public facilities and parks (in both neighborhood types) and % retail in routes to retail (in both neighborhood types).
While the latter is likely tautological (i.e., trips to retail are likely to pass through retail uses), the rest of the <U+FB01>ndings suggest
relevance of location and destination in children’s route choice. The similarity of results for multivariate models estimated for the
four trip destinations is fairly remarkable, with FAR and length consistently associated with route choice. These results suggest that
higher intensity of development along a route was favored, regardless of the type of destination being accessed. Future research may
bene<U+FB01>t from further exploring this using di<U+FB00>erent populations and setting, which may enable comparing <U+FB01>ner sub-groups de<U+FB01>ned by
both destination and location (e.g., suburban/route to school, inner-city/route to school, suburban/route to park, inner-city/route to
park, etc.).
    Our comparison between the modelled and the chosen paths also provide useful evidence for future studies aiming to use
modelled paths as surrogates for the actual paths chosen. Our <U+FB01>ndings were similar to those observed in studies that were conducted
among children in di<U+FB00>erent settings, such as the Netherlands (Dessing et al., 2016), the UK (Harrison et al., 2014), and Canada
(Buliung et al., 2013). Our <U+FB01>ndings suggest that modelled routes to school can serve as a surrogate to those chosen in more compact
environments, like inner-cities, but less so in suburban neighborhoods. By exploring additional destinations other than schools, the
current study further extends these insights by suggesting that the modelled route method may be a reliable surrogate for actual
routes in inner-cities when examining trips to school and to public facilities, and in suburban neighborhoods when concerning routes
to parks or to stores.
    This study is innovative in that it examines routes, which precisely show how pedestrians experience the built environment, as
opposed to points (origins, destinations) or polygons (neighborhoods). This is particularly important for children, as early exposure to
walking in these environments may have lifelong consequences. Also innovative is that we examine associations by neighborhood
(inner-city and clustered suburb). While such comparisons have been recently conducted by Buliung et al. (2013) and Harrison et al.
(2014), their studies focused solely on routes to school and less is known on routes to non-school destinations in these aspects.
Therefore, the current study <U+FB01>lls this gap in knowledge by including of di<U+FB00>erent types of daily destinations, other than school. The




                                                                   73

M.R. Moran et al.                                                                                  Transportation Research Part D 65 (2018) 63–81


study setting is also unique, as it does not represent the traditional city-suburb dichotomy. Instead, it represents the town center vs.
peripheral dense housing contrast, which is more relevant to European, Asian, and Latin American contexts. These comparisons are
valuable as environmental in<U+FB02>uences on walking and route choice are known to be context-sensitive.
    Despite its strengths, the study also has some limitations. First, the lack of objective route tracking and the reliance on self-reports
is biased as participants may have reported routes that they did not use. To prevent this bias, data was collect in small groups in the
presence of the <U+FB01>rst author. Overall, such false reports of routes are unlikely given that participants were highly invested in the
mapping activity (i.e., orienting their street maps, identifying landmarks, and memorizing their routes). Although a fair number and
variety of environmental exposures were included, other potentially relevant exposures were not included, such as aesthetics, tra<U+FB03>c-
and crime-related safety. Similarly, individual variables included only gender and age, and thus, other potential in<U+FB02>uences could have
not been identi<U+FB01>ed, such as: Household income, number of cars per household, number of siblings and order among siblings. While
some socioeconomic indicators were available at the neighborhood level (e.g., household car ownership, academic education), other
relevant indicators were not (e.g., household income), and thus some of the variables that are associated with SES or income may be
biased. This study included a socioeconomically homogenous population in a restricted geographical study area, which served to
minimize potential intervening e<U+FB00>ects. However, the combination of the limited geographical setting, sample size and narrow age
group reduces the generalizability of our <U+FB01>ndings. Future research should endeavor upon this limitation by using a sampling model
based on combinations of neighborhood and socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., inner-city/high-income, inner-city/low-income,
suburban high-income, suburban/low-income). Perhaps the most important limitation is that the comparison of routes taken and
routes not taken teaches us about where children walk or avoid walking but fall short in explaining why they do so. It also falls short
in providing causal estimates, as routes may have certain attributes precisely because pedestrians walk there. These questions are
essential to the understanding of the environment-behavior nexus, and thus should be addressed in future studies.

5. Conclusions

    This study examines children’s route choices in two distinct neighborhood settings and for various trip destinations in a medium-
sized city in Israel, a geographical area less studied in this <U+FB01>eld.
    Urban form and intersection density were found to have con<U+FB02>icting in<U+FB02>uences on children’s route choice. We found that routes
were more likely to be selected if they had fewer intersections, but a more compact urban form along the route. The results con<U+FB01>rm
the general importance of particular built environment attributes, and of speci<U+FB01>c urban form attributes that appear to in<U+FB02>uence the
street-level experience of pedestrians.
    Taken together, the <U+FB01>ndings highlight the challenge that planners and developers frequently face: Create environments that are
walkable and pedestrian-friendly, while attempting to minimize con<U+FB02>icts between pedestrians and motor vehicles. Slowing down
tra<U+FB03>c and providing amenities to decrease the negative impact of street crossings on routing decisions, are likely to be strategies that
are successful for improving walkability. Furthermore, given children’s vulnerability as road users, it is highly important for planners
to invest in safe infrastructure, especially in compact urban areas with potential daily destinations of children (e.g., residential areas,
schools, public facilities, parks).
    We also found di<U+FB00>erences in associations across neighborhood settings and destination types. To understand these <U+FB01>ndings, we
emphasize the role played by neighborhood and destination characteristics in shaping children’s route choices and raise the need for
more contextualized planning recommendations by tailoring them to speci<U+FB01>c scenarios (e.g., routes to stores in inner-cities, routes to
parks in suburbs). Finally, the results of the current study suggest that regardless of land uses, compact urban form is positively
related to children’s route choice; this complements prior research showing that similar attributes also increased overall walking in
children.
