1. Introduction

    Published systematic reviews have concluded that children and youth engaging in active school transport (AST), which represents
the use of non-motorized modes of transportation such as walking and cycling to travel to/from school, are more physically active
than those using motorized travel modes (Larouche et al., 2014a). Cycling to/from school is also associated with greater cardio-
vascular <U+FB01>tness and reduced cardiovascular disease risk factors (Andersen et al., 2011; Larouche et al., 2014b). Greater uptake of AST
could also help reduce vehicle emissions which are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and which
contribute to accelerate climate change (Patz et al., 2014). Despite these bene<U+FB01>ts, population-based studies have indicated substantial
declines in AST over the last few decades in countries including Canada (Gray et al., 2014), Switzerland (Grize et al., 2010), and the
United States (McDonald et al., 2011).
    Cooper et al. (2012) reported that, across the transition from primary to secondary school, physical activity (PA) increased among
children who switched from motorized travel to AST and decreased in those who switched from AST to motorized travel. These
<U+FB01>ndings suggest that AST could be an important target to prevent the age-related decline in PA that has been reported in many studies
(Bélanger et al., 2009a; Dumith et al., 2011; Nader et al., 2008; Sallis, 2000).
    Nevertheless, few prospective longitudinal studies have examined how travel behavior changes from childhood to adolescence.
Using data from the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, Pabayo et al. (2011) noted that the prevalence of
AST increases until the age of 10 and decreases markedly thereafter. Similarly, Cooper et al. (2012) observed that fewer British
children walked to/from school in secondary school compared to primary school, but those who did travelled longer distances. In
contrast, Hume et al. (2009) reported an increase in the number of weekly active trips to/from school between the ages of 12 and 14
years in Australia. Further, Belgian researchers noted that the prevalence of cycling to school was signi<U+FB01>cantly lower at 10 years
(46%) than between the ages of 11 and 16, when it ranged between 69 and 83% (Cardon et al., 2012). These con<U+FB02>icting <U+FB01>ndings
underscore a need for further research.
    Whereas it is often assumed that AST is subject to seasonal variations in regions with important seasonal climatic variations, the
evidence largely stems from studies using repeated cross-sectional designs. In such studies, di<U+FB00>erent participants were questioned in
di<U+FB00>erent seasons; thus it is possible that the observed seasonal variations are due to di<U+FB00>erences in samples across seasons.
Furthermore, previous studies examining seasonal variations in school travel mode have obtained inconsistent <U+FB01>ndings (Børrestad
et al., 2011; Kallio et al., 2016; Mitra and Faulkner, 2012; Robertson-Wilson et al., 2008). Kallio et al. (2016) reported that the
prevalence of AST was about 15 percentage points lower in the winter compared to the spring and fall among Finnish children
whereas Børrestad et al. (2011) reported that the decrease in cycling among Norwegian children was compensated by an increase in
walking. In contrast, two studies have shown no seasonal di<U+FB00>erences in the prevalence of AST in Ontario (Robertson-Wilson et al.,
2008) and in the City of Toronto (Mitra and Faulkner, 2012).
    In this analysis, we aimed to describe seasonal variations and changes over time in AST and moderate-to-vigorous intensity
physical activity (MVPA) using data from a prospective cohort study. As a secondary objective, we investigated the relationship
between changes in school travel mode and MVPA over 6 years covering the transition from childhood to adolescence.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

    Monitoring Activities of Teenagers to Comprehend their Habits (MATCH) is a prospective study for which Grades 5 or 6 students
were recruited in 17 schools in 2011 across the province of New Brunswick, Canada (Bélanger et al., 2013). Schools were purpo-
sefully sampled to include a mix of French and English schools in low, moderate and high socioeconomic neighbourhoods and in rural
and urban areas. There are no noteworthy di<U+FB00>erences in the education system of French- and English-speaking students in New
Brunswick. At Time 1, there were 806 participants aged 10.3 ± 0.6 years. Other students from participating schools were allowed to
join the study after Time 1 (39 joined in year 2, and 92 joined in year 4). In total, 937 children (55.2% female) took part in at least
one survey cycle of the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the Comité d’Éthique de la Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de
l’Université de Sherbrooke. Both participants and their parents provided active informed consent.

2.2. Setting

    In New Brunswick, school bus transportation is provided for students attending public schools and living beyond 2.4 km away
from school (or beyond 1.5 km for those living on side roads). This distance threshold can be lowered for students with special needs
(Government of New Brunswick, 2018). Normal temperature at the Greater Moncton International Airport vary from an average low
of -14.0 °C in January to an average high of 24.7 °C in July (Environment Canada, 2018). In the New Brunswick school system, the
transition from primary to secondary school does not occur at a single point in time. Some of our participants transitioned to
secondary school after grade 6, others after grade 8.

2.3. Protocol

   Study participants completed self-report questionnaires tri-annually (fall, winter, and spring). At the time of analyses, 18 survey
cycles with data on school travel mode and PA participation were available (i.e., from the fall of 2011 to the spring of 2017). One item

                                                                  372

R. Larouche et al.                                                                               Journal of Transport & Health 12 (2019) 371–378


was used to assess school travel mode at each time point: “Over the course of the last 7 days, how did you usually get to and from
school?” Response options provided in survey cycles 1 to 6 were “actively (e.g., walk, bike, skateboard)”, “inactively (e.g., car, bus,
public transit)”, or “mixed (e.g., actively and inactively)”. From survey cycle 7 to 16, participants could specify their mode of active
transportation such that the response options were “walking”, “biking”, “by skateboard or scooter”, “inactively (e.g., car, bus, public
transit)”, or “mixed (e.g., actively and inactively – e.g., walking and bus”). For analyses, responses from all cycles were coded as
active (“walking”, “biking”, “skateboard or scooter”), “mixed” (combination of active and motorized modes of transportation) or
“motorized”.
    Rural or urban status of participants’ municipality of residence was obtained based on postal codes reported by participants.
Participants were considered to live in a rural setting if the municipality of residence included less than 10,000 residents or in an
urban setting if it included 10,000 residents or more (Government of Canada, 2011).
    The 2-item screening tool developed by Prochaska et al. (2001) was used to assess MVPA. Participants were asked to indicate how
many days they engaged in MVPA for at least 60 min on a (1) typical week and (2) this past week. Response options ranged from 0
(days) to 7 (days). The following preamble was used to de<U+FB01>ne MVPA to the participants: "Physical activity is any activity that
increases your heart rate and makes you get out of breath some of the time. Physical activity can be done in sports, playing with
friends, or walking to school. Some examples of physical activity are running, brisk walking, rollerblading, biking, dancing, skate-
boarding, swimming, soccer, basketball, hockey, and skiing.” An average of the two items was taken to create an overall MVPA score.
This measure has substantial test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.77) and is moderately associated with accelerometer-measured MVPA (r
= 0.40) among 12 year olds (Prochaska et al., 2001).

2.4. Data analysis

    Descriptive statistics and examination of outliers for MVPA within our sample, de<U+FB01>ned as z-scores above |3.29| (which normally
include 99.9% of observations) were performed in SPSS Version 25 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). Odds ratios were computed
using polynomial logistic regression within a generalized linear mixed model framework (GLIMMIX procedure in SAS version 9.4,
Cary, NC, USA) to identify whether season, time, and sex were associated with school travel mode, while accounting for clustering of
the repeated measures for each child as a random e<U+FB00>ect. Models were also adjusted for school attended, type of urbanization (i.e.,
urban vs. rural), and age at cycle 1 (for participants that joined the study later, we estimated their age at cycle 1 based on their age at
the <U+FB01>rst cycle in which they participated). In this model, motorized transportation was used as the reference category because it was
the most prevalent mode. An interaction term was also tested to verify if the e<U+FB00>ect of survey cycle on school travel mode di<U+FB00>ered
across seasons. Results are reported as odds ratios with 95% con<U+FB01>dence intervals.
    Linear regressions within the generalized linear mixed models framework were used to examine the relationship between school
travel mode and MVPA (GENLINMIXED procedure in IBM SPSS version 25, Armonk, NY). Speci<U+FB01>cally, these models examined the
number of days where participants accumulated at least 60 min of MVPA as a function of school travel mode, sex, survey cycle, and
season, while also accounting for clustering of the repeated measures for each child as a random e<U+FB00>ect. Models were also adjusted for
school attended, type of urbanization, and age at cycle 1. A quadratic term was used for survey cycle based on visual inspection of the
data, which indicated that the rate of change in MVPA was not following a linear pattern. We also tested an interaction term between
survey cycle and season. Results are reported as unstandardized regression coe<U+FB03>cients with 95% con<U+FB01>dence intervals. For continuous
dependent variables, the coe<U+FB03>cients represent the changes in the outcome per unit of the dependent variable, whereas for categorical
variables, they represent the di<U+FB00>erences in the outcome between the categories compared. Although participants with missing data
were retained in analyses through full information maximum likelihood, cycles for which they did not provide data were deleted
listwise.

3. Results

    Descriptive statistics for school travel mode and MVPA at each time point are presented in Supplementary File 1. At any survey
cycle, between 5.5 and 16.3% of participants were categorized as active travelers and between 7.4 and 17.6% were “mixed” travelers.
Participants completed a median of 11 cycles (interquartile range = 7–16). No outliers for MVPA were identi<U+FB01>ed (all z < |2.42|) and
between 11.7 to 21.4% of participants reported = 60 min of daily MVPA at each survey cycle. Seasonal variations and longitudinal
trends in school travel modes are illustrated in Fig. 1. Missing data ranged from 28.2–61.0% for AST and from 21.6–61.0% for MVPA
across cycles. Characteristics of participants at cycle 1 are shown in Table 1.
    The interaction term assessing if the e<U+FB00>ect of survey cycle on school travel mode di<U+FB00>ered across seasons was not signi<U+FB01>cant (p =
0.37) and was not retained for the model presented herein. Season, time (survey cycles), type of urbanization, and participants’ sex
were statistically signi<U+FB01>cant predictors of school travel mode (Table 2). The odds of using AST compared to motorized modes were
considerably lower during winter than fall survey cycles (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.38, 0.61). Over the 18 cycles of follow-up, there
was an increase in odds of engaging in AST compared to motorized modes (OR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.12); in other words, the
odds of AST increased by an average of 8% per cycle. Odds of using active (OR = 2.90; 95% CI = 1.37–6.14) and mixed (OR = 3.61;
95% CI = 2.16–6.03) modes rather than motorized modes were higher among participants living in urban compared to rural areas.
Finally, boys were over three times more likely than girls to use AST (OR = 3.41; 95% CI = 2.18, 5.35) compared to motorized
modes.
    There was no statistically signi<U+FB01>cant di<U+FB00>erence in MVPA between children who reported using active and motorized modes of
transportation (Table 3). However, mixed travelers reported at least 60 min of MVPA more often than their counterparts using

                                                                   373

motorized modes (ß = 0.27 days/week; 95% CI = 0.16, 0.39). Boys reported at least 60 min of MVPA on more days per week than
girls (ß = 0.30 days/week; 95% CI = 0.22, 0.37). Compared to the fall survey cycles, participants reported less MVPA in the winter
(ß = -0.27 days/week; 95% CI = -0.44, -0.10). Participants living in urban areas reported more MVPA than those living in rural areas
(ß = 0.27; 0.14, 0.39). The quadratic term for survey cycle was statistically signi<U+FB01>cant (p < 0.001) and inspection of the mean MVPA
data (Appendix 1) indicates that MVPA increased in the <U+FB01>rst few cycles and declined afterwards. The interaction term between survey
cycle and season was also signi<U+FB01>cant (p = 0.010). Speci<U+FB01>cally, it indicated that although participants reported less MVPA during the
winter than the fall, there was an attenuation of di<U+FB00>erences between seasons over time (ß = 0.02; 95% CI = 0.00, 0.04).


4. Discussion

    Using a unique longitudinal dataset that included triannual follow-ups over a 6-year period from the same children and youth
over time, the present analyses extend previous research examining seasonal variations and temporal changes in AST and MVPA. Our
results provide evidence of considerable seasonal variations in these behaviors with the prevalence of AST and the frequency of
accumulating = 60 min of MVPA/day being signi<U+FB01>cantly lower in the winter compared to the fall.
    These results are consistent with those of Kallio et al. (2016) among Finnish children; however, they are in contrast with two other
Canadian studies conducted in the province of Ontario (Mitra and Faulkner, 2012; Robertson-Wilson et al., 2008). An important
di<U+FB00>erence between these studies and ours is that previous studies were limited by the use of repeated cross-sectional designs with
only two survey cycles, whereas our study bene<U+FB01>ted from following up the same participants over many cycles. Our <U+FB01>ndings support
the need for additional e<U+FB00>orts to promote AST, especially during the winter months. Nevertheless, it is worth emphasizing that the
rates of AST were low throughout all seasons. This is in agreement with results from the nationally-representative Physical Activity
Monitor study which indicated that only 9% of school-aged children in New Brunswick regularly engage in AST (Gray et al., 2014).
    Our observation that participants reported less MVPA during winter is consistent with previous research on the seasonal dif-
ferences in PA (Bélanger et al., 2009b; Tucker and Gilliland, 2007). Recent analyses using the International Children's Accelerometry
Database also suggest that better visibility and additional daylight is associated with higher PA (Goodman et al., 2014; Harrison et al.,
2017). Furthermore, other researchers have shown that many parents do not allow their child out without supervision when it is dark
outside until they reach a certain age (Shaw et al., 2015), which might reduce opportunities for AST in the darkest months of the year.
Presumably, the inconvenience of exposure to cold temperature and the time needed to put on warmer clothes may also be viewed as
deterrents to AST and MVPA in the winter.

    The observation that AST increased over time is consistent with studies conducted in Australia (Hume et al., 2009) and Belgium
(Cardon et al., 2012), which reported an increase in the frequency of AST and an increase in cycling to/from school respectively.
However, it is in contrast with many North American studies indicating lower rates of active transportation among high school
students compared to their primary school counterparts (Evenson et al., 2003; Fulton et al., 2005; Gropp et al., 2012). Such <U+FB01>ndings
are commonly attributed to increasing distance between home and school, which has been identi<U+FB01>ed as the most consistent correlate
of AST (Wong et al., 2011). Another Canadian multi-year longitudinal study documented that the relationship between age and the
prevalence of AST was curvilinear, with a peak at 10 years of age followed by a substantial decline (Pabayo et al., 2011). Independent
mobility (e.g., children's freedom to move around in public space without adult supervision) typically increases with age (Hillman
et al., 1990; Shaw et al., 2015), and when children travel without parental accompaniment, they are more likely to use active modes
(Mitra, 2013). This may partly explain the increase in AST over time. Collectively, these <U+FB01>ndings suggest that the relationship
between age and school travel mode may be more complex than commonly thought.
    Although distance was not measured in the current study, one would expect that, on average, children living in urban areas would
live closer to school than their counterparts in rural areas. In line with our <U+FB01>ndings, previous North American studies have con-
sistently reported higher rates of AST in urban areas (Gray et al., 2014; Pabayo and Gauvin, 2008; Robertson-Wilson et al., 2008). The
observation that children living in urban areas were more active than their rural counterparts is also consistent with previous
research (Liu et al., 2008; Rainham et al., 2012).
    In accordance with previous North American studies (Gropp et al., 2012; McMillan et al., 2006; Pabayo and Gauvin, 2008;
Robertson-Wilson et al., 2008), we observed that boys were much more likely to engage in AST than girls. It is possible that parents
are more inclined to restrict independent mobility among girls than boys, in part because girls are perceived to be more vulnerable
(Brown et al., 2008). Nevertheless, studies in Northern European countries, where AST (especially cycling) is more prevalent, ty-
pically do not show such gender di<U+FB00>erences (McDonald, 2012). Moreover, previous research suggests that, by traveling in groups,
girls can enjoy as much independent mobility as boys (Brown et al., 2008). Collectively, this body of evidence suggests that it is
possible to resolve the sex di<U+FB00>erence in terms of participation in AST. E<U+FB00>orts to promote AST among girls could help bridge the gap
we also noted between boys and girls with regards to participation in MVPA and which is consistent with previous studies (Colley
et al., 2017; Hallal et al., 2012).
    We observed that the frequency of accumulating at least 60 min of MVPA per day followed a curvilinear pattern over time with an
increase in the <U+FB01>rst few survey cycles followed by a decrease. Whereas some research supports our <U+FB01>ndings that PA peaks in early
adolescence and declines afterwards (Allison et al., 2007; Telama and Yang, 2000), other studies suggest that PA may start to decline
as early as the age of school entry (Farooq et al., 2018; Reilly, 2016). Collectively, this body of evidence emphasizes the need for
promotion of PA across the life course. Furthermore, we also noted that at each time point, less than a quarter of participants
accumulated at least 60 min of daily MVPA. These results are consistent with self-reported data from 105 countries compiled by
Hallal et al. (2012). In their pooled analyses, 80.3% of 13- and 15-year-olds did not meet MVPA recommendations.
    There was no di<U+FB00>erence in the frequency of accumulating at least 60 min of MVPA between active and motorized travelers; yet,
participants using mixed modes reported greater levels of MVPA than those using motorized modes. These counter-intuitive <U+FB01>ndings
might re<U+FB02>ect di<U+FB00>erences in distance between home and school between active and “mixed” travelers. Perhaps the latter lived further
away from school on average. Alternatively, it is plausible that many highly active youth participated in organized sports after school,
and active travel to such venues and/or to go back home may be impractical. It is worth noting that our <U+FB01>ndings are inconsistent with
two previous longitudinal studies indicating that switching from motorized to active school travel was associated with increases in
accelerometer-measured MVPA (Cooper et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2012). Our crude self-reported measure of MVPA may have failed to
capture transport-related PA. For example, participants may have considered walking to/from school as light-intensity PA rather than
MVPA. The low prevalence of AST in our sample may also have limited our ability to detect a relationship with MVPA.
    Our <U+FB01>ndings have implications for policy-makers and practitioners. They highlight a need for interventions to counteract the
decline in MVPA and the low prevalence of AST across survey cycles. Interventions such as walking school buses and school travel
planning may help increase AST and MVPA (Larouche et al., 2014, 2018). In the United States, school travel accounts for 10–14% of
private vehicles on the road during the morning peak period; hence, AST interventions could help reduce tra<U+FB03>c congestion and
minimize the costs of school travel (McDonald et al., 2011, 2016). However, according to a recent systematic review (Larouche et al.,
2018), previous AST interventions have focussed almost exclusively on primary school children. Our results suggest a need for
researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers to collaborate to develop and implement interventions to promote AST in secondary
schools.
    It is also important to emphasize that all previous studies investigating seasonal variations in AST used repeated cross-sectional
designs. In other words, di<U+FB00>erent samples were recruited in di<U+FB00>erent seasons; hence, observed changes could be at least partly due to
di<U+FB00>erences between samples rather than true di<U+FB00>erences between seasons. Understanding seasonal variations in AST is important for
researchers interested in PA and public health and for practitioners involved in AST interventions, which could be less successful in
the winter. To this end, our results suggest that additional e<U+FB00>orts may be needed to promote AST and MVPA in the winter.
Multicomponent school-based interventions show promise in increasing PA among children and adolescents (Kriemler et al., 2011).
Notably, Comprehensive School Health interventions have resulted in improvements in PA and eating habits, and reductions in the
likelihood of obesity in the Canadian context (Veugelers and Schwartz, 2010). Practitioners could tailor school-based interventions to
promote winter activities.

4.1. Limitations and strengths

    The main limitation of our study relates to the use of self-reported measures of MVPA and school travel mode, which may be
subject to social desirability and recall bias (Shephard, 2003). Second, while the 2-item MVPA measure has been shown to be reliable
and signi<U+FB01>cantly correlated with accelerometer-measured PA (Prochaska et al., 2011), it may have failed to capture PA during AST.
Third, the psychometric properties of our measure of travel behaviors is unknown; however, researchers using similar questions have
shown substantial test-retest reliability and convergent validity between child and parent reports (Larouche et al., 2014c). Fourth,
data on distance between home and school were not collected in the MATCH study. Fifth, there was a substantial amount of missing
data present across all survey cycles which is notably due to two schools interrupting their participation in the study early, to student
absenteeism on data collection days and to loss to follow-up. The use of generalized linear models allowed us to make full use of data
from all participants while attributing proportionally more weight to those with more data points. Sixth, the loss to follow-up may
a<U+FB00>ect generalizability of the study. Seventh, we cannot tell how much walking was accrued by the students reporting mixed modes.
    Conversely, the prospective study design with multiple data collection cycles over many years is a major strength of this study. To
our knowledge, no previous study has examined PA and school travel mode on a triannual basis from childhood to adolescence. This
has allowed us to more precisely examine seasonal variations in AST compared to previous studies which used repeated cross-
sectional designs.

5. Conclusions

    Our prospective cohort study has shown that the likelihood of engaging in AST varies substantially by season among New
Brunswick students, with lower odds in the winter compared to the fall. Similar seasonal patterns were noted for MVPA. These
observations suggest that additional e<U+FB00>orts are needed to promote AST and MVPA in the fall and winter. Consistent with previous
research (e.g., Dumith et al., 2011), we also observed a decline in MVPA over time, which underscores a need for PA interventions
focusing on the transition from childhood to adolescence. Interventions may be particularly needed in rural areas where participants
were substantially less active and less likely to engage in AST. Finally, we have observed that boys were over three times more likely
to engage in AST compared to girls. Given that travelling in groups seems to enable girls to develop their independent mobility
(Brown et al., 2008), parents and practitioners could encourage young girls to engage in AST with their peers. Social marketing
campaigns may also help counteract the negative attitudes toward AST that often develop in adolescence, particularly among girls
(Underwood et al., 2014).
