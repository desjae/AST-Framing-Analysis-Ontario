1. Introduction

    Adolescence is arguably one of the most dynamic and formative stages in the development of an individual’s travel preferences
and habits. Teenagers are granted more freedom to travel from their caregivers (although this may be declining (Carver et al., 2014)),
and thus have more say in their own travel decisions than younger children. In many parts of the world, particularly in the US,
teenagers have the option of transitioning from car passenger to car driver, with the additional freedoms but also responsibilities that
this entails. The choices that teenagers make about their travel have immediate implications for their health and well-being as well as
for the environment, but they may also have long-lasting implications by contributing to the formation of habits that shape their
travel behavior as adults (Baslington, 2008). One of the most frequent and therefore habit-forming travel teenagers engage in is their
daily travel to and from school. A steady decline in active travel to school in the US is therefore especially troubling (Baslington,
2008; McDonald et al., 2011), and planners, health o<U+FB03>cials, policy makers, and others are seeking e<U+FB00>ective strategies for reversing
the trend.
    Most strategies to increase active travel to school seek to change road environments to improve conditions for active travel or to
change attitudes toward active travel through education and encouragement. We use the term road environments in the broad sense,
encompassing physical characteristics of the road (or street) that people experience when traveling including natural features like

hills and built features such as number of travel lanes and the presence of sidewalks, but also tra<U+FB03>c characteristics and other qualities
that re<U+FB02>ect the use of the road. Evaluations of intervention strategies have largely focused on primary and not high schools, leaving
an important gap in the research with respect to the relation of the road environment and attitudes to the active travel decisions of
teens. The limited evidence available points to the importance of both attitudes (of parents and students) and road environments but
the magnitudes of these relationships are uncertain.
    In this study, we examine usual mode choice to high school, focusing speci<U+FB01>cally on the magnitude of these relationships. We
analyze the in<U+FB02>uence on travel mode to school of travel attitudes and road environments along plausible paths to school using data
from a large cross-sectional survey of students at three high schools in Northern California.
    Given its cross-sectional design, the study does not provide de<U+FB01>nitive evidence of causal relationships but the associational
evidence it generates is important for establishing the likely magnitudes of relationships between variables. The results can inform
conceptual models of teen travel and provide direction for future studies. Improving our knowledge of the factors in<U+FB02>uencing teen
travel to school contributes to the development of e<U+FB00>ective strategies for increasing the number of teenagers who walk and bicycle to
school and who carry these habits into adulthood.

2. Travel to school

    Travel mode choice to school can be framed as a joint choice between parent and student and as a potential joint travel outcome
(parents escorting their children). Joint travel outcomes signi<U+FB01>cantly add to the complexity of mode choice, because parents’ travel
constraints (e.g. schedules, mode options, commute directions) and preferences interact with their children’s constraints and pre-
ferences. As children become more independent, this joint choice and potentially joint travel outcome changes (Mitra, 2013), further
adding to the complexity. While travel to school is repeated and mandatory and is therefore likely to follow routine or habitual
behaviors, teenagers are a particularly diverse cohort in that they span key developmental years where household and peer re-
lationships are in <U+FB02>ux, and for most, travel mode options are expanding.
    Although growing concern over the decline in active travel to school in the U.S. has motivated numerous studies of travel to
primary and middle school (Ewing et al., 2004; McDonald, 2008; McDonald et al., 2011; Noland et al., 2014), less is known about
mode choice to high school, particularly the choice to walk or bicycle. In studies of mode choice to school, age and gender are
commonly identi<U+FB01>ed as important predictors. In general, older and male students are more likely to walk or bicycle to school (Ewing
et al., 2004; Kamargianni and Polydoropoulou, 2013; McDonald et al., 2011). However, the e<U+FB00>ect of age may be reversed for older
teens because of reliance on the car after driver’s licensing (Clifton, 2003). Indeed, access to a car, whether as a passenger or a driver,
is likely to be a key factor in mode choice. Though studies show that teen licensing rates have declined, teens still travel pre-
dominantly by car, especially older teens (Blumenberg et al., 2012; Clifton, 2003; McDonald et al., 2011). Of course, car access is
heavily dependent on familial economic status: in many cases teens that do not drive do so because of economic restraints, not choice.
For teens that do begin to drive, evidence from longitudinal data on female teen travel suggests that acquiring a driver’s license
primarily changes the amount of parent chau<U+FB00>euring, while the connection to active travel is less clear (McDonald et al., 2015). These
<U+FB01>ndings suggest that active travel may not be increasing even as teen licensing rates decline in the U.S.
    The physical environment in<U+FB02>uences the choice to walk or bicycle to school in many ways. Evidence suggests that distance to
school is the primary barrier for walking and bicycling (Emond and Handy, 2012; McMillan, 2007, 2005; Schlossberg et al., 2006).
Attempts at decreasing travel distance to school tend to con<U+FB02>ict with attempts to provide <U+FB02>exibility and choice in public education
(He and Giuliano, 2017). At the high school level, the con<U+FB02>ict between promoting active travel to school and freedom of school
choice is likely weaker than for primary schools because distances to neighborhood high schools are further to begin with; fewer
students live within reasonable walking and bicycling distance to their local high school than to their local primary school. Longer
distances to high school suggest a clear policy challenge for getting more teens walking and bicycling to school. This distance
challenge is part of the broader challenge of increasing sustainable travel in U.S. cities shaped by decades of planning for low-density
development with segregated land uses.
    In addition to distance, evidence suggests that urban characteristics measured for areas (e.g. for a neighborhood or for a bu<U+FB00>er
around origin or destination) like residential density and street connectivity are associated with active travel to school (Carlson et al.,
2014; Mitra and Buliung, 2015). Urban features such as sidewalk coverage have been shown to in<U+FB02>uence walking to school as well
(Ewing et al., 2004; Noland et al., 2014). However, other studies do not <U+FB01>nd consistent relationships between urban characteristics
and active travel to school. Mitra (2013) reviewed 42 studies on school travel (only six which cover teenagers) and reported results
for variables such as intersection density, sidewalks, street connectivity, and mixed land use to be generally inconclusive with respect
to active travel to school. The main problem is that these area-based measures do not capture the speci<U+FB01>c environments experienced
by individual students on their path to and from school.
    Studies that focus on the environments along the routes that individuals take rather than on general school-area environments
show that width and quality of sidewalks in<U+FB02>uence teen mode choice to school, although the e<U+FB00>ects varied by urban environment
(Kamargianni et al., 2015; Kamargianni and Polydoropoulou, 2014). Other linear characteristics (e.g. route directness, major street
crossings) in<U+FB02>uence teen travel mode to school according to one study (Mitra and Buliung, 2015). However, these characteristics are
more strongly associated with travel to school by younger (11 year old) compared to older (14–15 year old) students (Mitra and
Buliung, 2015). In theory, and according to some empirical evidence, individual route-based features of the built environment more
strongly in<U+FB02>uence active travel compared to non-route-based features (Broach, 2016; Handy et al., 2002); however, very little
evidence exists on the relationship between route-based features and teen travel to school.
    Speci<U+FB01>c aspects of the built environment that promote bicycling are less clear since many studies of active travel to school do not

                                                                    36

separate bicycling and walking behavior, muting the unique factors that in<U+FB02>uence the choice to walk or bicycle to school (McDonald,
2008). Evidence from bicycling research beyond school travel would suggest that perceptions that access to school is safe and
comfortable (as might be the product of bike lanes, separated paths, limited tra<U+FB03>c, slow tra<U+FB03>c), along with trip-end facilities such as
bike racks would be important factors (Pucher et al., 2010).
    The attitudes and perceptions of both students and parents about bicycling also a<U+FB00>ect mode choice according to several studies
(Dill and McNeil, 2013; Driller and Handy, 2013; McDonald, 2012). A 2009 survey of high school students in Davis, CA, showed that
parental encouragement and students’ comfort riding a bike in<U+FB02>uence bicycling to high school (Emond and Handy, 2012). In an
altogether di<U+FB00>erent geographic context, the latent attitude “willingness to walk or bike” was associated with active travel in a survey
of teen travel to school in Cyprus (Kamargianni and Polydoropoulou, 2013). Interestingly, both studies show that students tend to use
the same travel mode as their parents. These <U+FB01>ndings suggest considerable parental in<U+FB02>uence, although some of this association may
be due to parents and students traveling in similar environments.
    Student and parent perceptions and attitudes about active travel safety are likely to in<U+FB02>uence travel mode decisions given that
negative perceptions correlate with less active travel in younger children (McMillan, 2007; Timperio et al., 2004). Perceptions about
safety for walking and bicycling relate to both the physical environment and how other people use that environment. For example,
Woldeamanual et al. (2016) provide evidence suggesting that chau<U+FB00>euring of teens is positively correlated with parent perceptions of
the amount of tra<U+FB03>c. This positive correlation runs counter to the standard assumption that tra<U+FB03>c is psychologically noxious and
increases travel time, relationships that mean that tra<U+FB03>c should negatively correlate with chau<U+FB00>euring. Instead, the positive cor-
relation seems to imply that (1) parents who chau<U+FB00>eur are more aware of tra<U+FB03>c, and/or (2) parent’s attitudes about the safety risk of
walking and bicycling in tra<U+FB03>c outweigh the inconvenience of driving through it to drop o<U+FB00> students. The latter rationale ensures a
vicious cycle of chau<U+FB00>euring. This example highlights one of many roles attitudes and perceptions play in the complex decision of
teen mode choice to school.

3. Methods

3.1. Study setting

    In this study, we analyze usual mode choice to school of students from three Northern California high schools: Davis Senior High
in Davis, CA, Sequoia High in Redwood City, CA, and Tamalpais High in Mill Valley, CA. This study is an extension of an initial study
of bicycling to high school in Davis in 2009 (Emond and Handy, 2012). Because Davis is an especially bicycling-oriented city with
numerous o<U+FB00>-street bike paths and a long history of bicycling (Buehler and Handy, 2008), two additional schools were surveyed to
represent more typical suburban environments in California to enhance the generalizability of these results to other cities.
    Redwood City and Mill Valley are within 100 miles of Davis. They have some bicycling activity but it is not a primary mode of
travel as it is in Davis. Beyond the di<U+FB00>erences in bicycling rates, these three communities di<U+FB00>er in their socio-demographics, sur-
rounding topography, and bicycling infrastructure. Mill Valley, where Tamalpais High is located, has the highest median family
income ($158,906) and Redwood City the lowest ($93,257), but all three have median incomes above the state average (US Census
Bureau, 2013). Mill Valley also has considerable topography compared to the other communities; Tamalpias High is located in a
valley where most residences are at higher elevations requiring uphill travel on the return trip from school. Mill Valley is also known
for its mountain biking, and Tamalpais High is the only school (of the three) to have a mountain biking club.1 Davis is also sur-
rounded by non-urban land (agriculture) with the nearest city more than 10 miles away. Redwood City is notably di<U+FB00>erent in that is
shares borders with many other cities. It has a comparatively larger percentage of Hispanic population compared to Davis and Mill
Valley. Davis has a comparatively larger Asian population, and Mill Valley a larger White population (US Census Bureau, 2013). The
survey results, reported below, show that the three schools are strikingly similar with respect to driver’s licensing and distributions of
distances to school. However, like the demographics of the cities, the percentage of Hispanic, Asian, and White students di<U+FB00>er.

3.2. Survey data

    School volunteers administered an in-class two-page questionnaire (adapted from the 2009 survey) during the <U+FB01>rst week of May
2013, when the weather in Northern California is typically ideal for active travel. The survey included questions on usual travel
mode, demographics (age, gender), personal attitudes, parental education level (as a surrogate for socio-economic status), and
nearest cross street to home (for the full survey instrument see Lovejoy and Handy (2013)). We de<U+FB01>ned usual travel mode in <U+FB01>ve
classes: drive (students who drove themselves with or without passengers), chau<U+FB00>eured (students who were passengers in a car driven
by a guardian or a fellow student), walk, bike, and bus. Reported travel modes of skateboard, motorcycle, and train were so small
they were added to walk, drive, and bus, respectively. We treated a few nonsense responses (e.g. travel via “hot air balloon” or
“teleport”) as missing data. Also, we reduced parental education level and race to two categories each because of few responses in
some categories. Attitudinal questions were posed using a Likert 5-point response scale from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree, and
focused on perceptions and preferences about travel to school, particularly bicycling.
    Since the surveys were administered in class, and 83% of classrooms participated, a large number of surveys were collected: 3076
total surveys (Davis = 1227 (71% of enrolled), Sequoia = 1088 (54% of enrolled), Tamalpais = 761 (62% of enrolled)). Although

participation was high, many students chose to skip some key questions. Case-wise deletion for any missing value reduced the sample
nearly in half. Most of this reduction was due to missing home cross streets or di<U+FB03>culty geocoding home cross streets, but data on
parent education, attitudes, and travel behavior was also often missing. Because of the extent of missing data we imputed values using
multiple imputation by chained equations from the R statistical package MICE (Van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011).2 The
MICE algorithm imputes missing data one variable at a time and iteratively updates imputations (see Azur et al. (2011) for a full
description). We imputed <U+FB01>ve full datasets to account for uncertainty in the imputation, retained only the records with reported
values (not imputed) for the dependent variable of mode choice to school (n = 2814),3 ran each statistical model (see Section 3.4
below) on each of the <U+FB01>ve datasets independently, and pooled the estimated parameters from the <U+FB01>ve estimations of each model for
summarizing the models.

3.3. De<U+FB01>ning bicycling attitudes

    The original purpose of the survey was to explore bicycling behavior across the three high schools as a follow-up to an earlier
study of Davis alone (Emond and Handy, 2012). For this reason, and to keep the length of the survey to only two pages, the survey
included many questions on attitudes towards bicycling but very few on attitudes toward other modes (Lovejoy and Handy, 2013).
Thus, while we explore road environments with regards to walking and bicycling, we focus on student attitudes toward bicycling but
not walking. The omission of walking attitudes is a notable limitation of this study that researchers should rectify in future studies.
    The Likert items were designed to explore the attitudinal and perceptual di<U+FB00>erences among teenagers who travel by bike com-
pared to other modes. The items were based on past survey work (Emond and Handy, 2012) with a few minor changes to reduce
social desirability bias. We compared two methods of analysis for the Likert data, one in which all attitudinal items were treated as
independent predictors, and the other in which attitudinal items were summed to create four composites (Table 1). We reversed the
scales of items with expected negative correlation with bicycling to make composite scores meaningful and for ease of item com-
parison. The composites were loosely based on the di<U+FB00>erent levels of a social ecological model of active living (see Sallis et al.
(2006)). While all the composites are intrapersonal in the sense that they represent psychological constructs, the constructs them-
selves re<U+FB02>ect di<U+FB00>erent social ecological domains. For example, Enjoyment and Self-image are constructs related to the intrapersonal
domain, Social pressure is related to the social cultural environment domain, and Environment is related the perceived environment
domain (Sallis et al., 2006). The items relating to social pressure might also be called social norms, but the two items with the
strongest correlations with bicycling are clearly about social pressure (Table 1) and so we choose to label the construct Social pressure.
We also conducted more advanced techniques such as exploratory factor analysis and integrated choice and latent variable models
(see Vij and Walker (2016)) but these o<U+FB00>ered little inferential improvement (see Fitch (2018)).

3.4. Road characteristics and walking and bicycling environments

       We coded several road attributes in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to describe the bicycling and walking environments in

   2
     We followed default estimation procedures for the MICE package (i.e. predictive mean matching for numeric variables, logistic regression for binary variables,
polytomous regression for the unordered response variables, and proportional odds model for the ordered Likert variables). We restricted chained equations for the
Likert variables to other Likert variables, school, shortest distance to school, and usual travel mode to school. All other variables included all existing variables in their
chained equations. When imputed shortest path distances were beyond the surveyed maximum walking/bicycling distance of the sample by school, we assumed the
student lived beyond a reasonable walking/bicycling distance and removed walking and bicycling from those choice sets. Similarly, if the imputed value for driver’s
licensure was “none” or car access was “no”, we removed driving from those choice sets.
   3
     Removing records with an imputed dependent variable arguably improves the precision of imputation by exchanging variance between data sets for variance
within data sets. This improved precision may be especially helpful when using a small number of imputed datasets as we have done (see von Hippel (2007)).

each community. The attributes include the number of travel lanes, speed limit, median presence, bike lane presence and width, on-
street parking, parking width, and signalized intersections. We chose road environment measures that corresponded with the lit-
erature on perceived bicycling safety and convenience. For example, evidence suggests that low car speed and volume roads (e.g.
two-lane roads, posted speeds < 25mph) and bike speci<U+FB01>c infrastructure (e.g. bike lanes, o<U+FB00>-street paths) in<U+FB02>uence perceived bi-
cyclist safety (Buehler and Dill, 2016). We use slope (measured as percent) and number of tra<U+FB03>c signals to represent bicycling
convenience. We based the road attributes on local city GIS <U+FB01>les, OpenStreetMap data, and visual inspection of Google’s Street View
imagery. We used historical Street View images from 2013 when available to match the GIS data to the survey period. Where 2013
imagery was unavailable, we used the image with a date nearest to May 2013 to code the GIS data. We limited the geographic extent
of our data to roughly 4 miles surrounding each high school, which we assumed was beyond what most teens would consider a
reasonable walking or bicycling distance to school.
    We summarized the road environment through route-based instead of area-based measures (e.g. bu<U+FB00>ers around homes) because
those measures include information that is irrelevant at the trip level and may miss important information along the route (Broach,
2016). Because data on students’ routes to school were unavailable, we simulated plausible routes by using a route choice set
generation algorithm based on Broach et al. (2010). The algorithm utilizes a network cost that is a function of distance and one road
attribute at a time (e.g. bike lane), and uses a range of weights to determine the in<U+FB02>uence of the road attribute on network cost. The
purpose of including a range of weights is to generate paths re<U+FB02>ecting the unknown trade-o<U+FB00>s students make between distance and
the quality of the walking or bicycling environment. We used this algorithm (see below) over a series of road attributes and then
compiled a single value for each road attribute by using path weights based on the square of inverse distance of all generated paths
per student. The inverse distance weight e<U+FB00>ectively treats shorter paths as more likely to be chosen. More formally, we considered a
set of road attributes L = {street crossing, tra<U+FB03>c signals, two-lane road, bike lane, bike lane without on-street parking, wide bike lane
(=14 ft along parking or =6 ft not along parking), o<U+FB00>-street paths, percent slope4, adjacent to commercial land use, speed limit less
than 25 mph, BLTS5 level 1, BLTS level 2, BLTS level 3}, with 1 for presence, and 0 for absence on each network link. And a set of
distance weights, D = {0.95, 0.9, 0.75, 0.5}, representing the percentage of in<U+FB02>uence distance has on link cost compared to the road
attribute. We then:

(1) De<U+FB01>ne the network as a series of nodes (intersections) and links (roads and o<U+FB00>-street paths).
(2) De<U+FB01>ne the cost for each network link based on distance only and call that the <U+FB01>rst network.
(3) De<U+FB01>ne the cost for each network link by each road attribute and distance weight combination (see Broach et al. (2010) for
    another example of this approach):

               Cijk = Dj × dk + (1-Dj ) × Li

      where Cijk is the cost for one road attribute i and one distance weight j on link k; d is the link length, Dj are distance weights, and Li
      are road attributes. This results in 53 unique networks (4 distance weights * 13 road attributes + 1 network based only on
      distance) for each school.

(4) Solve the least cost path for each student (from home to school) on each of the 53 networks and remove redundant paths resulting
    in a unique set of paths for each student. This results in a minimum of 1 and maximum of 53 paths per student.
(5) For each student, using inverse distance weights for all simulated paths, create a single variable for each of the following road
    attributes: number of signals, percent two lane roads, percent vehicular speed < 25 mph, percent bike lane, percent o<U+FB00>-street
    path, percent of slope over 3% (see Fig. 1 for a visual example of percent bike lane). The equation for one student and one road
    attribute dropping their respective subscripts is:

                           <U+239B> <U+239B>         1       <U+239E> <U+239E>
                           <U+239C> <U+239C>d / <U+2211> d 2<U+239F> <U+239F>
                                 p ( p p)
               L* = <U+2211> Lp × <U+239C> <U+239D>                 <U+23A0> <U+239F>
                    p      <U+239C>     <U+239B>       1       <U+239E><U+239F>
                           <U+239C><U+239C> <U+2211>p <U+239C>              2<U+239F> <U+239F>
                                                   <U+239F>
                                   dp / (<U+2211>p dp )
                            <U+239D>    <U+239D>               <U+23A0><U+23A0>

      where dp is the distance for the path p, <U+2211>p dp is the sum of simulated path distances, Lp is the percent of path length of the road
      attribute on path p, and L* is the <U+FB01>nal distance weighted statistic.

   For example, assume a student has three paths (A, B, C) with lengths 0.6, 0.5, 1.0 miles and bike lanes along 50, 30, and 80% of
those paths respectively (Fig. 1). Using the equation in step 5 above, short paths are given greater weight than longer paths when
summarizing each road attribute. In Fig. 1, path B gets 43% of the weight (as opposed to 33% weight in an equal weighting scheme),
whereas path C only gets 21% of the weight. This student would get a <U+FB01>nal L* value of 51% bike lane (18% + 13% + 2%). This
represents a distance-weighted bike lane percent based on plausible paths to school. For each road attribute, this procedure

3.5. Model Development and analysis of behavior

    Along with bivariate summary statistics, we analyzed travel behavior using a series of categorical regression models (i.e. mul-
tinomial logit with one response per case) and compare their estimated e<U+FB00>ects and prediction performance (see Table 2 for model
descriptions). We speci<U+FB01>ed the models by selecting variables that had prior evidence for in<U+FB02>uencing teen mode choice. For example,
socio-demographic and travel constraint variables are in all models (Table 2), road environment variables in models 2 and 5, and
attitudes in models 3–5. For the walking utility equation, we only use path summaries of two-lane roads, posted speed < 25 mph,
and number of tra<U+FB03>c signals as these attributes have been linked to both comfort and perceived safety of walking (Handy and Clifton,
2001). We did not have walk speci<U+FB01>c environment measures (e.g. sidewalk coverage, crossings) that are also reported in the literature
(Kamargianni et al., 2014). In our statistical models we included varying intercepts by school because of the clustered nature of the
data. Di<U+FB00>erences in the intercepts for the three schools re<U+FB02>ect the fundamental di<U+FB00>erences between the schools related to context,
culture, and other omitted factors. This is a common approach to relax model assumptions and improve inference (Gelman and Hill,
2007; Train, 2009).
    We use a Bayesian analysis framework for all modeling because it produces easily interpretable posterior probabilities (i.e. a
distribution of probable values for each parameter) and because prior probabilities are an easy tool for reducing model over<U+FB01>tting
(see Kruschke and Liddell (2018) for a detailed discussion of other advantages of Bayesian inference). Beyond these fundamental
statistical reasons, we chose a Bayesian modeling approach because its <U+FB02>exibility allowed us to model mode choice with varying
choice sets (see below) and varying intercepts, aggregate results from <U+FB01>ve models (because of imputation), and predict aggregate
travel outcomes and their uncertainty. In all models we use so called “weakly informative” prior probabilities to guard against
over<U+FB01>tting (Gelman, 2006). Through the R statistical package Rstan as an interface for the probabilistic statistical programming
language Stan, we estimated the models with the No-U-Turn (NUTS) sampler, a form of Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulation (Stan Development Team, 2017).
    The general model form is as follows:

                                                                              40

where yi is the travel mode choice for person i. Uij is the utility of choice alternative j for each person. aj is the alternative speci<U+FB01>c
constant. aj, school [i] is the alternative speci<U+FB01>c constant that varies by school, indexed by person (i.e. varying intercept) and scaled by
the alternative speci<U+FB01>c school standard deviation (sj ). We scale the varying intercepts by their standard deviations to improve
sampling. This is known as the non-centered parameterization (McElreath, 2015, p. 403). ~        aj, school [i] is the unscaled varying intercept.
ßmj are alternative speci<U+FB01>c regression coe<U+FB03>cients for predictor variables (Xmi ) , M in number. When we drop subscript i for clarity, the
categorical logit sampling statement for one person implies the probability of each choice is:
                                       eUk
         Pr(y = k ) =                J
                                    <U+2211> j = 1 eUj

where k is the chosen alternative among J choices. To handle situations where not all travel modes are available for a given student, a
varying choice set model is appropriate. This entails a reduction of J for students with travel mode constraints. We had two con-
straints in our model. The <U+FB01>rst was for students without any form of driver’s license. Because those students cannot legally drive, we
removed drive from their choice set. In one case, a student reported having no form of license but indicated they drove to school. In
that case, we allowed drive in that student’s choice set. The second constraint was for reasonableness of walking and bicycling to
school. We constrained choice sets by removing bike and walk options for students who lived beyond the extent of our GIS data which
we built to roughly cover 4-mile network distances to school. In 18 cases we removed bike and walk for students either living
between 3 and 4 miles from school but who lacked reasonable access (i.e. highway riding or walking), or who reported physical
conditions that limited their ability to walk or ride a bike. Given that walking and bicycling generally occur at much shorter distances
(Chillón et al., 2016, 2015), these assumptions are conservative in their behavioral representation. In 4 cases students reported
bicycling from outlying cities with one-way travel distances greater than 10 miles. We included walk and bike in those students’
choice sets assuming that either they have another home location that they ride from (e.g. their distance estimate is inaccurate for
their “usual” mode to school) or that they are unlike their peers and really have a very long regular bike commute. To avoid confusing
notation, we have not included choice set constraints in the above model equation. However, we do limit the choice set (J) to one of
four based on the above constraints. The sets are: {chau<U+FB00>eured, bus}; {chau<U+FB00>eured, drive, bus}; {chau<U+FB00>eured, bike, walk, bus},
{chau<U+FB00>eured, drive, bike, walk, bus}.
    Because we imputed missing data prior to model estimation, we assessed the convergence and sampling success of three Markov
chains on each of <U+FB01>ve datasets (<U+FB01>ve imputations) using standard Stan diagnostics (Stan Development Team, 2017). For inference, we
pooled all 15 chains (3 chains * 5 datasets) to assess the full uncertainty across all imputations. We use in-sample predictions6 of mode
choice of each of the 5 datasets and pool the results to assess model performance. We also use two measures of out-of-sample
prediction: widely applicable information criteria (WAIC), and pareto smoothed importance sampling estimate of leave one out cross
validation (LOOIC) (Vehtari et al., 2017). Each of the out-of-sample prediction measures is on the deviance scale and is interpreted as
a relative (between models) measure of predicted deviance just like other common information criteria (e.g. AIC, DIC). The ad-
vantage of these methods is their applicability for multilevel models and their use of the entire posterior distribution (as opposed to
point estimates of other information criteria) to assess out-of-sample prediction (Vehtari et al., 2017).

4. Results and discussion

4.1. Mode choice by school and socio-demographics

   The three schools have a similar total share of active travel to school of around 30–40%, although the split between bicycling and
walking is reversed for Davis High compared to Tamalpais High and Sequoia High (Fig. 2). The di<U+FB00>erence in bicycling between Davis
and the other schools was expected as a part of the study design. However, the rate of walking at the other two schools was

   6
     Sometimes called retrodiction (McElreath, 2015, p. 64) because it is predicting past data the model has already learned from. We use the term prediction because it
is more familiar even though not as precise.

unexpected given that the distances to school are similar across schools. This bivariate analysis suggests that perhaps Davis students
are substituting bicycling for walking rather than car travel. However, modeling results suggest a more complex tradeo<U+FB00>, as discussed
in Sections 4.2–4.5.
    A form of car travel (e.g. driving, chau<U+FB00>euring) is the dominant mode to school for teenagers at all three schools, and the share of
active modes declines by age (Fig. 2). This is good evidence that these schools are at least similar to many suburban high schools in
the U.S. where car travel to school is the norm. Most students reported using the same mode to and from school; however, at all three
schools, a small share of students get a ride to school in the morning and then walk or bus home in the afternoon. Survey results for
mode to school show less bicycling and walking in high school versus middle school (Fig. 2). This is especially true in Davis, where
bicycling declines precipitously presumably as driving replaces it.
    Mode to school varies by parent education, race, and whether a student has a driver’s license (Table 3). Parent education seems to
be a proxy for income since students whose parents have a Bachelor’s degree or higher are much more likely to drive (i.e. have access
to their own car). However, higher parent education is also associated with more bicycling (Table 3). Similarly, White and Asian
students drive and bicycle at greater rates compared to other races. However, this result is dominated by di<U+FB00>erences in Davis, not
Sequoia and Tamalpais, suggesting that the race/travel mode correlations may be a result of a “Davis” e<U+FB00>ect. Most students with a
driver’s license are driving to school, but the rates of walking/bicycling are similar to chau<U+FB00>euring for students with driver’s licenses.
Although the percentage of students with a driver’s license who do not drive to school is small, this pattern suggests that licensure has
a larger impact on decreasing chau<U+FB00>euring than it does on decreasing walking/bicycling, consistent with other studies of the impact
of licensure on teen travel (McDonald et al., 2015).
    Travel mode seems fairly consistent across genders even though the chi-square test statistic suggests an association. The only clear
di<U+FB00>erence is that females bicycle less and are chau<U+FB00>eured more than males (Table 3). This gender di<U+FB00>erence (chau<U+FB00>eured substituting

for bicycling) is less pronounced in Davis, with 41% of bicyclists being female, compared to 24% and 21% at Sequoia and Tamalpais,
respectively. In the following sections we focus on how the road environment and bicycling attitudes explain these di<U+FB00>erences
through multivariable analyses.


4.2. Statistical model evaluation

    We present model estimation results and parameter summaries in Appendix A. The predictive success of the models varies
dramatically by travel mode. Fig. 3 shows a “confusion” plot of the in-sample mode choice predictions using Model 5. A model
perfectly predicting the sample would have 100% of cases on the diagonal (i.e. cases o<U+FB00> the diagonal are misclassi<U+FB01>ed by the model).
Most prominent in Fig. 3 is the misclassi<U+FB01>cation of students who took the bus to school. Most of those students are misclassi<U+FB01>ed as
having been chau<U+FB00>eured. This is not surprising given that we have no variable representing household income (only surrogates),
which is known to correlate (negatively) with taking a bus to primary school (McDonald, 2008). Nor are there measures of bus
attitudes or bus availability in the models. Similarly, walk/skate is often confused for chau<U+FB00>eured, a result also likely explained by the
lack of walk-speci<U+FB01>c attitude data and more detailed walk-speci<U+FB01>c road environment data (e.g. percent sidewalks, crosswalks, etc.). It
is unclear if the models are poorer with respect to the bus alternative than in other travel behavior studies because rarely do such
studies report in-sample prediction checks.
    The predictive performance of the models (as indicated by decreases in information criteria values) improves with increasing

complexity (Table 4). For example, Model 5 has a LOOIC of 4551.2 compared to Model 1 with a LOOIC of 5100.9 showing a decrease
of nearly 550 units of deviance, where less deviance is equivalent to less expected predictive error. Prediction is improved in-
dependently when road environment or attitudinal variables are included. Road environment variables o<U+FB00>er only about half of the
improvement gained from the attitude variables (see deviance di<U+FB00>erences between models in Table 4). However, when attitudes and
road environment variables are both included, their combined in<U+FB02>uence is additive resulting in the best performing model (Model 5
in Table 4).


4.3. Attitudes about bicycling

    We examine the relationship between attitudes measured using Likert item responses and travel mode through parameter values
in Model 3 (Fig. 4). Most Likert item responses have con<U+FB01>dently positive associations with travel mode to school. Items such as “I live
too far away from school to bicycle there” and “My parents/guardians encourage me to bicycle” clearly have a stronger association
with bicycling to school than the other items (Fig. 4). Most interesting are the di<U+FB00>erences in item coe<U+FB03>cients within the environment
and social pressure groupings. For the three items related to bicycling environment, only the perception of not living too far to bicycle
was positively associated with bicycling (not perceptions of hilliness and safety). This is surprising because other evidence from
adults suggests that perceptions of safety are more in<U+FB02>uential than objective measurements of environments for bicycling (Ma et al.,
2014). It may be that distance is such a strong barrier that many students don’t even consider other environmental barriers once they
hold the position that it is simply too far to bicycle to school. Alternatively, teens are notoriously risk taking (Romer, 2012), sug-
gesting that perceptions of safety may not be good predictors of bicycling. The lack of clear connection with perceived safety suggests
that many students who do not bicycle to school think it is safe to do so.
    The four items related to social pressure have di<U+FB00>erent relationships with bicycling (Fig. 4). Parental in<U+FB02>uence is the strongest
followed by the two items related to peers. Because of the di<U+FB00>erent wording of the Likert items, it is di<U+FB03>cult to compare the
magnitudes of parent and peer in<U+FB02>uence precisely. Most surprising is the negative association between the item “lots of people bicycle
in my community” and bicycling to school. This is surprising because the bivariate relationship between bicycling and this item
shows a slightly positive relationship (r = 0.22). Collinearity of predictors may be a reason for this e<U+FB00>ect, as some items do have
moderate correlations with each other (r = 0.2–0.3). The negative relationship may also be an indication of the major di<U+FB00>erence
between the schools; most Davis students strongly agree that bicycling is common in their community no matter how they travel to
school, while Sequoia and Tamalpais have nearly an equal share of agreement and disagreement that bicycling is common. One thing

is clear: the contributions of parent, peer, and community pressures to bicycle are likely unequal. Given that the survey purposely (to
decrease bias) measured peer and community pressures with indirectly worded Likert items, it would be prudent to verify these
speci<U+FB01>c results in future studies.
    Some results from our analysis using single Likert items (from Model 3) can be compared to the prior high school travel study in
Davis (Emond and Handy, 2012). Even considering that the comparison between Emond and Handy (2012) is not ideal (they used a
binary bicycling/not bicycling model instead of categorical mode choice model), the strength of the relationships between the
commonly-used Likert items and bicycling are strikingly similar. For example, Emond and Handy (2012) report odds ratios of 1.3–1.4
for “I like bicycling” and 2.0–2.1 for “my parents/guardians encourage me to bicycle” depending on model speci<U+FB01>cation. Ex-
ponentiating the posterior means from Model 3 (see Appendix A for parameter means) gives odds ratios of 1.2 and 2.0 for those same
items. This similarity suggests that perhaps attitudes about bicycling have a consistent association with bicycling across at least the
three contexts examined in this study.
    Composite attitudinal variables were on average most positive for Davis students and most negative for Sequoia students
(Table 5). The slightly more positive attitudes about bicycling at Tamalpais compared to Sequoia (except for Environment) may be a
result of more frequent bicycling in middle school (Fig. 1), but could also be associated with recreational bicycling. In addition, the
association between attitude and travel mode is stronger than the association between attitude and school (Table 5). This result
suggests that these attitudes are not just a re<U+FB02>ection of bicycling culture in Davis but rather generalizable factors across schools.
Model 4 regression results (Fig. 4) con<U+FB01>rm the inference from the individual Likert items that some bicycling attitudes are more
important than others. Although the scale of the composite attitudes (z-scores) are not directly comparable to the Likert items (raw 5-
point rating) (Fig. 4), the di<U+FB00>erences between the attitudes within each model are comparable in magnitude. More speci<U+FB01>cally, social
pressure to bicycle and perceptions of the bicycling environment have stronger relationships with travel mode choice than do
bicycling enjoyment and self-image.

4.4. Road characteristics and travel mode to school

    Compared to the other schools, plausible paths to school in Davis are an order of magnitude di<U+FB00>erent in terms of road en-
vironment variables. Fig. 5 shows the distribution (the gray “violin” is a kernel density estimate of the distribution), median, in-
terquartile range, and full range (box and whiskers) of each distance weighted road environment variable by school. X-axes vary by
road environment variable, but are comparable between schools. Fig. 5 shows that gentle slopes, low speed limits, two-lane roads, o<U+FB00>-
street paths, and bike lanes are more prevalent along plausible paths to school in Davis compared to Sequoia and Tamalpais. This is
the case even though distances to school are comparable across schools. Paths to Sequoia and Tamalpais primarily di<U+FB00>er by slope
(Tamalpais being by far the steepest) and percentage bike lane, but only to a small degree by other road environment variables.
Because most students who bicycle to school also bicycle home (only 4% take an alternative mode home), the terrain around

Tamalpais is likely a strong deterrent for bicycling at Tamalpais because of steep uphill travel home.
    Di<U+FB00>erences in road environment variables by mode are more moderate compared to di<U+FB00>erences by school (Figs. 5 and 6). Dis-
tances are clearly shortest for walk/skate, and therefore number of tra<U+FB03>c signals are fewest. Those students who bicycle have a
greater percent of two lane roads, bike lanes, o<U+FB00>-street paths and slow-speed roads on their plausible active travel paths to school
compared to student who are chau<U+FB00>eured and drive. The opposite is true of students who walk/skate. This suggests that students may
be walking when the road environment is not conducive for safe bicycling. It also suggests that students who travel by the other travel
modes (bus, chau<U+FB00>eured, and drive) likely have paths to school that are more stressful and less comfortable for bicycling.
    The marginal e<U+FB00>ects of each road environment variable on walking and bicycling are best represented by the posterior densities of
the parameters in Models 2 and 5 (see Fig. 7 for Model 5 estimates). Fig. 7 shows large uncertainty in the estimates of most variables
apart from number of signals and distance (these two variables are respectively counts of signals and miles while the others are all
percentages). The large uncertainty is likely due to our use of road environment variable summaries along plausible paths to school.
Had we had data on actual paths to school, marginal e<U+FB00>ects would likely have been more precise. However, it is clear from these
results that o<U+FB00>-street paths, bike lanes, and slow-speed roads have con<U+FB01>dently positive associations with bicycling, while steep roads
and long distances have con<U+FB01>dently negative associations with bicycling (Fig. 7). Slow-speed roads have a more uncertain in<U+FB02>uence
on walking since two lane and low speed limit roads do not align in their e<U+FB00>ects (Fig. 7). The negative association between low speed
limit roads and walking is counterintuitive given that it is reasonable for students to prefer walking in low vehicle speed environ-
ments because they are less noxious and easier to cross. However, given that Tamalpais and Sequoia are located very near major
arterials, most walkers do not have the option of detouring to slow speed roads. This lack of options is evident from Fig. 6 where the
walk/skate group has the lowest percent of two lane and low speed limit roads in their plausible paths. If walkers do not have low
speed road alternatives in their plausible paths, the in<U+FB02>uence of low speed roads on walking cannot be assessed. The same reasoning
can be used to question the con<U+FB01>dently negative association between number of signals and walking. While students with fewer
signals along plausible paths would be more likely to walk, most walkers have only one signal on their path to school. What is more
likely is that distance is the primary barrier, which is evident from Fig. 6 as well. For bicycling, the in<U+FB02>uence of distance is clearly
negative, but less so than for walking.


4.5. How teen travel mode share might look with better road environments and stronger attitudes toward bicycling

    We have thus far examined both the road environment and bicycling attitudes in association with travel mode. From model
comparisons, we showed that bicycling attitudes are nearly twice as strong predictors of mode choice as the road environment
(Table 4). However, the magnitude of individual variable relationships with mode choice has been di<U+FB03>cult to assess since the
predictor variables are on di<U+FB00>erent scales and the coe<U+FB03>cients are on the log-odds scale. To better understand the magnitude of these
relationships, we use counterfactual predictions of travel mode based on di<U+FB00>erences in road environments and attitudes. These
predictions do not assume a causal model, that is, the question is not: how does changing the road environment for student X change
the likelihood of student X bicycling? Instead, the question is: considering hypothetical cohorts of students (e.g. a future class) with
better road conditions and stronger bicycling attitudes, what is their mode share? In this way, we can compare the strength of the
associations without assuming that changing those predictor variables would cause a change in individual mode choice. The rationale
for this type of simulation closely follows the argument posed by Chorus and Kroesen (2014) which challenges the causal language

                                                                       46

often used when modeling with cross-sectional data and latent variables. We use the simulation to provide clarity about the strength
of the associations discussed above but also to take seriously the inability to draw <U+FB01>rm causal inferences from this data.
    We start by assuming that the simulated students resemble the sampled students by leaving unchanged all variables (see Table 6
base scenario). Then we keep all the sociodemographic variables (i.e. those from Model 1) unchanged, but make attitudes more
positive, improve road environments, and decrease distances, all by 20% in varying combination in the next <U+FB01>ve scenarios (see
Table 6). For example, the 20% reduction in distance corresponded to reducing the median distance to school from 1.9 miles to 1.5
miles and the mean distance from 2.9 miles to 2.1 miles. Fig. 8 shows the predicted probabilities from Model 5 for all 6 scenarios.
Improving the road environment alone results in about a 5-percentage point (p.p.) greater bicycling and lower chau<U+FB00>eured, drive,
and walk mode shares. Improving the road environment and having students live closer to school results in greater bicycling (9p.p.)
and walking (10p.p.), with predominantly fewer students being chau<U+FB00>eured (-16p.p.). The lack of strong negative di<U+FB00>erence in
drive (-3p.p.) for this scenario suggests that even when distances are short and environments are conducive to bicycling, students
are likely to drive at similar rates. When distances and environments are unchanged but students have stronger bicycling attitudes,
we see a large positive di<U+FB00>erence in bicycling (15p.p.) and a large negative di<U+FB00>erence in chau<U+FB00>eured (-11p.p.). This result suggests
that attitudes have a stronger in<U+FB02>uence on bicycling than do distance and road environment variables for the same percentage change
(also supported by model comparisons in Section 4.2). However, a 20% change may not be equally plausible for each variable.
    The last scenario, which combines 20% improvements in attitudes, road environments, and distance, shows that bicycling can
increase nearly 29p.p. compared to the baseline scenario. The “e<U+FB00>ects” of improving the road environment and attitudes seem to be
nearly additive on bicycling (also supported by model comparisons in Section 4.2). Our results also suggest that the main mode
tradeo<U+FB00> for bicycling is being chau<U+FB00>eured, as the declines in driving and walking are much smaller in these scenarios. The only
scenarios that saw rises in walking and bicycling are those in which distances to school were reduced. The distance barrier for
walking suggests that improvements to the road environment without concurrent decreases in distance will likely only in<U+FB02>uence
bicycling, and only to a small degree. A caveat to this inference is that this analysis lacked data on walking attitudes and environ-
ments from home to school. If we had better data on walking environments (e.g. sidewalks, crosswalks), we might <U+FB01>nd that walking-
speci<U+FB01>c features had a strong association with walking (even at moderate distances).
    The driving mode share is the most con<U+FB01>dent and consistent estimate across the scenarios (Fig. 8). The consistency suggests that it
may be very challenging to reduce driving to school. On the other hand, chau<U+FB00>euring is much more responsive to these scenarios,

5. Conclusions

    Bicycling studies in Davis, CA can produce unique insights into bicycling behavior (because bicycling is a normal travel mode),
but they may not be generalizable to most other places in the US where bicycling for day-to-day travel is an exception. By combining
data from two similar schools without a large bicycling mode share, we get a unique look at teen travel that generalizes beyond Davis.
Nonetheless, these three schools represent only suburban-style communities with high levels of car access among teens, and gen-
eralizing to dense urban or rural environments or to populations will low levels of car access is not appropriate. Nonetheless, the
results may prove generalizable to many of the numerous suburban high schools in the U.S.
    Travel mode choice to high school is a complex process involving some variables that were unavailable in this study (e.g. parent
work schedules), and many variables that may be bi-directionally causal (e.g. attitudes, driver’s licensure). This makes inference
challenging. Nonetheless, the evidence we have replicates many previously-found associations between socio-demographics and teen
travel (see Appendix A for all parameter values), and suggests strong relationships between bicycling attitudes and bicycling to
school, and moderate relationships between the road environment and bicycling to school.
    What do these results say about potential interventions to increase walking and bicycling to high school? The cross-sectional
nature of the data limits our ability to conclude that changing road environments and attitudes will result in changes in current
student behavior. The case for a causal link between the road environment and travel behavior is stronger. Although we do not
account for “self-selection” through residential location choice (i.e. parents choosing to live where it is easier or safer for walking and
bicycling to school), one study of bicycling that accounts for “self-selection” suggests that the road environment still in<U+FB02>uences bike
ownership and use (Handy et al., 2010). Our results clearly indicate that simulated students who match those of the sample but with
more safe and comfortable access to school, shorter travel distances, and stronger pro-bicycling attitudes would be walking and
bicycling to school much more frequently. A way to think about this counterfactual is in the planning for new students. Consider that
every four years the student population at high school completely turns-over. We would expect a new wave of students to bicycle
more if policies could successfully improve the road environment for bicycling. In addition, policies aimed at increasing local at-
tendance should reduce travel distances resulting in greater walking and bicycling to school.
    The e<U+FB00>ectiveness of programs aimed at changing travel attitudes may be more uncertain given that behavior change may be
needed to change travel attitudes (reverse causality) (Chorus and Kroesen, 2014; Kroesen et al., 2017). However, some speci<U+FB01>c
