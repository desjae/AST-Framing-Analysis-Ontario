Abstract Rising levels of childhood obesity in the United States and a 75% decline in the
proportion of children walking to school in the past 30 years have focused attention on
school travel. This paper uses data from the US Department of Transportation’s 2001
National Household Travel Survey to analyze the factors affecting mode choice for ele-
mentary and middle school children. The analysis shows that walk travel time is the most
policy-relevant factor affecting the decision to walk to school with an estimated direct
elasticity of 0.75. If policymakers want to increase walking rates, these findings suggest
that current policies, such as Safe Routes to School, which do not affect the spatial
distribution of schools and residences will not be enough to change travel behavior. The
final part of the paper uses the mode choice model to test how a land use strategy—
community schools—might affect walking to school. The results show that community
schools have the potential to increase walking rates but would require large changes from
current land use, school, and transportation planning practices.

Introduction
Concern about rising levels of obesity in children and adults has led the U.S. Surgeon
General to recommend ‘‘regular, moderate physical activity’’ as an important component of
a healthy lifestyle (Jackson 2003). Research has shown that many children are not attaining
the physical activity recommended by the Surgeon General. Rates of overweight (defined

as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index) increased from 6%
in 1971–1974 for ages 12–19 to 17% in 2003–2004; similar increases were seen in other
age categories (Ogden et al. 2006).
    The rise in childhood obesity has occurred at the same time children have radically
changed how they get to school. In 1969, 42% of American students walked or biked to
school (Beschen 1972); by 2001 that number had dropped to less than 15% (McDonald
2007a). Overall children now make nearly 80% of their trips by auto (Surface Transpor-
tation Policy Project et al. 2003) and only 20% of U.S. students walked or biked enough to
gain health benefits (Kann et al. 1998).
    Many researchers believe that if more children walked or biked, it might be possible to
lower children’s health risks (Tudor-Locke et al. 2001). Policymakers have begun to
support the goal of getting children to walk to school. The Centers for Disease Control has
launched the KidsWalk program to encourage children to walk to school. Several states
facilitate walking to school through their Safe Routes to School (SR2S) programs, which
fund improvements near school sites. The current federal transportation bill, SAFETEA-
LU, contains over $600 million for a national Safe Routes to School program. While these
programs are important, they presume that safety rather than distance is the primary barrier
to walking to school.
    This research tests the hypothesis that the current spatial distribution of students and
schools leads to long trip distances and is a primary reason for the current low rates of
walking to school. Using a multinomial modeling framework, I identify how trip length,
controlling for individual and household characteristics, influences the decision to walk to
school. The model results are then used to predict how urban planning and design strat-
egies, which address the spatial distribution of schools and students—such as community
schools—could affect how children travel to school.
Previous research
Across the developed world, children have become increasingly reliant on automobiles for
their mobility. In the US, over 75% of children’s trips are in private vehicles (Surface
Transportation Policy Project et al. 2003). Children in Melbourne, Australia use autos for
70% of their travel (Ampt 1996). Part of the reason for the use of cars is that parents are not
allowing children to travel alone. Hillman et al. (1990) showed that English schoolchildren
had less travel freedom in 1990 than in 1971. For example, 50% of schoolchildren aged 6
to 11 were allowed to ride buses alone in 1971; while only 14% were allowed to do so in
1990. What is not yet clear is how much the reliance on automobiles has contributed to
children’s obesity.
    A study of Russian children showed that walking to school provided a substantial
portion of children’s physical activity in Russia (Tudor-Locke et al. 2002). Work in the
Philippines has also shown that children who walk to school also had higher levels of total
physical activity (Tudor-Locke et al. 2003). Cooper et al. (2003) found that primary school
boys in the United States who walked to school had higher levels of physical activity
afterschool and in the evenings than their peers. One contradictory study concluded that
walking to school represented only 2% of weekly physical activity for 5-year-old British
boys and did not lead to an increase in overall physical activity (Metcalf et al. 2004).
However, the very restricted focus of this work (5-year-old boys) leads to questions about
the generalizability of the findings. While the current focus is on obesity, a separate body

of research suggests walking to school also provides an important step in children’s
maturation by allowing them to acquire the skills necessary to negotiate the world inde-
pendently (Banerjee and Lynch 1977; Hillman et al. 1990).
Key factors
Researchers have identified several factors which influence travel behavior in children,
particularly the decision to walk. Studies in the United States (McMillan 2007; McDonald
2007b; Schlossberg et al. 2006), the United Kingdom (Black et al. 2001), and Australia
(Timperio et al. 2006) have shown distance to be a critical factor in children’s travel. Girls
are less likely to walk than boys with the differences being most prominent at younger ages
(Evenson et al. 2003; O’Brien et al. 2000) and in suburban areas (Vliet 1983). Household
factors such as car ownership and parents driving to work also affect mode choice
(Bradshaw and Atkins 1996; DiGuiseppi et al. 1998). The built environment appears to
exert a small, but significant, effect on walking to school. In a study of Oregon middle
schools, Schlossberg et al. (2006) found that urban form—as measured by higher inter-
section densities and lower proportions of dead-ends—was associated with walking to
school. McMillan’s (2007) study of California elementary students found a modest
relationship between urban form and walking.
    Another factor repeatedly cited is safety. Parents express concern about traffic dangers
and the risk of abduction or harassment (Martin and Carlson 2005). Geographers con-
cerned with children’s sense of place have noted that safety concerns have led parents to
limit the time children spend playing in public spaces, and the safety-imposed restrictions
are more severe for girls than boys (Valentine 1997).
    Research on SR2S programs has shown that public policies can affect travel behavior.
In a study of California elementary schools, Boarnet et al. (2005) showed that the presence
of a SR2S infrastructure improvement caused more children to walk and bike when
compared to a control group. A separate evaluation of the SR2S programs in Marin
County, California showed a 64% increase in walking to school, which the authors
attributed to the program (Staunton et al. 2003).
Methodology
This research uses a multinomial logit model to understand mode choice for the trip to
school (see Train 2003, for model derivation). The model structure assumes that children
and their parents, as a family unit n, choose the child’s travel mode, j, to maximize utility,
Unj. The assumption that children’s travel modes are chosen to maximize household utility
is critical, since it is clear that the parents’ wishes may completely determine mode choice.
Assuming Unj = Vnj + enj and enj is distributed iid extreme value results in a closed form
representation for the probability of choosing each mode, j, for each person, n.

Model specification
In this model, decision-makers face a choice between driving, walking and taking a school
bus or transit to school. The representative utility of each mode for each person, Vnj, is a
function of trip, child, household, and neighborhood characteristics.
                               Vnj ¼ aj þ bj Tnj þ dj Cn þ cj HHn ;                            ð2Þ
Vnj represents the observed utility to person n of mode j; aj is an alternative specific
constant; Tnj is the travel time required for person n to complete the journey by mode j; Cn
represents the characteristics of the individual such as age and gender; HHn represents
household factors such as income.
    Auto is the reference mode, with only auto travel time entering its utility function. In
addition, it was assumed that students would value travel time differently for each mode.
Therefore, the coefficients on the travel time variables are not constrained to be equal.
Factors were retained in the model if they were significant at the 0.05 level or if there was a
theoretical or research reason for keeping the variable. Marginal effects are calculated for
each individual and then averaged across the sample. Aggregate direct and cross elastic-
ities are also provided for continuous variables.
Choice sets
For the multinomial model, the universal choice set was auto, bus/transit, and walk.
Although transit and school bus may seem like very different modes, I have combined
them to ensure that this mode is available to all students. In many cities, there is no school
bus service. Instead students use public transit to get to school. In many suburban and rural
areas, there is no public transit available. Because I have no information on whether a
school bus or transit is available for the school trip, I make the assumption that at least one
of these modes will be available. Clearly, there are important differences between school
buses and public transit—primarily the fact that students share space on public transit
buses with adults. This may affect parents’ and students’ perceptions of safety and comfort
for each of these modes. Future research will be needed to study the possibility of ana-
lyzing these modes separately. Because very few students biked to school (*1%), I have
excluded this mode from the analysis.
    Many students live quite far from school, making walking an unrealistic choice.
Because of this, I tested a model which eliminated walking from an individual’s choice set
if estimated walk travel time was greater than 1 h. This restricted the choice set of nearly
half of the students in the sample. Analysis of the model with a restricted choice set versus
an unrestricted choice set showed no appreciable differences in the coefficients on travel
time. Therefore I present results of models estimated with unrestricted choice sets.
Data
Data come from the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), the most recent
national travel survey collected by the US Department of Transportation. The NHTS
provides trip diaries for 66,000 households. Collected between March 2001 and May 2002,
the dataset includes information on trip purpose, mode, time, length, as well as who in the

household was on the trip. The dataset also includes descriptive information for each
person, e.g., age, sex, and household, e.g., household size, income, auto ownership, density
at residence. Each participating household was assigned a ‘survey day’ on which they
recorded all trips. For the 2001 survey, the survey methodology included prompts to ask
respondents about non-motorized trips which tend to be underreported (U.S. Department of
Transportation 2004). This new methodology led to a substantial increase in the reporting
of walking trips (Pucher and Renne 2003).
   This analysis focuses on elementary and middle school, defined as ages 5 through 13,
because travel behavior changes dramatically when children reach high school and have
much greater auto access (Rhoulac 2005). The unit of analysis is the trip tour from home to
school rather than unlinked trips. This accounts for the fact that many children travel with
siblings in the morning, often making stops at their schools as well. Tours were included in
the analysis if they occurred between September and May, began before 10:30 in the
morning, and had no intermediate stops longer than 30 min (approximately 3% of the
sample had stops of more than 30 min). In addition, students that biked to school,
approximately 1% of students, were eliminated from the analysis. The final requirement
was that average travel speeds (computed as self-reported distance divided by self-reported
travel time) must be reasonable.1 This requirement increased the likelihood that self-
reported distances were accurate. Given these restrictions, the sample includes 6,508
children from 4,394 households with 47% being driven, 41% taking the bus or transit and
12% walking. Demographic characteristics show that the sample has fewer minority
members (6% African-American, 4% Hispanic, and 4% Asian-American), and is higher
income than the population of the United States (Table 1).
Variables
The primary trip characteristic is travel time. The usual method of estimating travel times
for mode choice models requires an origin-destination travel time matrix. This is impos-
sible with national data. Because of this, I used speed factors to translate the reported trip
1
  The definition of ‘‘reasonable’’ was based on the data. Any walking trips with an average speed of 16 kph
(10 mph, the 93rd percentile) or driving trips of 80 kph (50 mph, the 95th percentile) were removed from the
sample.
                                                                                                123

28                                                                 Transportation (2008) 35:23–35
distance into time. The speed factors were calculated from the dataset based on the median
travel speeds by mode and whether the household was located in an urbanized area. For
auto trips, there were substantial speed differentials depending on whether the household
was located in a (census-defined) urbanized area. For example, the median automobile
speed in urbanized areas was 25 kph (15 mph) compared with 39 kph (24 mph) for non-
urbanized areas. The median walk speed was 4.3 kph (2.7 mph). The average trip distance
among all elementary and middle school students was 6.4 km (4.0 miles) (Table 1).
   Bus travel times were not included in the model, because their inclusion led to highly
unstable models and non-sensical results, i.e., coefficients on the travel time for multiple
modes were non-negative. These findings are consistent with Ewing and Greene (2003)
who in their analysis of student travel in Florida found it difficult to estimate bus travel
times and estimated the model without bus travel times. They asserted their belief that the
decision to ride the bus is made without regard to bus travel time. Further research is
needed to refine the definition of trip characteristics for bus travel.
Results
Simple averages show that 48% of students living less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from their
school walked compared with a walk rate of 3% for students living more than 1.6 km from
their school. However, of the 6,508 children in the study only 20% lived within 1.6 km of
their school. The mode choice model provides a more detailed understanding of these
descriptive statistics. Because the current debate on children’s travel is focused on walking
to school, I concentrate my analysis on walking but also present statistics for the effects on
the auto mode.
Travel time
The model shows that travel time—in essence distance to school—has the strongest effect
on the decision to walk to school (Tables 2 and 3). A 1 min increase in walk travel time
leads to a 0.2% decline in an individual’s probability of walking; a 10% increase in walk
travel time leads to a 7.5% decrease in walk mode share. The direct walk travel time
elasticity is quite close to the value estimated by Ewing and Greene (2003) in a study of
school travel in Gainesville, Florida. Children are much less sensitive to auto travel times.
A 1 min increase in auto travel time leads to a 0.01% increase in the probability of
walking; a 10% increase in auto travel time leads to a 0.1% increase in the likelihood of
walking.
Child characteristics
Although distance and travel time are the most critical variables, several individual and
household level characteristics are also important. A 1 year increase in age leads to a 0.4%
increase in the probability of walking and a corresponding 1.4% decline in the likelihood
of being driven. Having siblings also makes children less likely to be driven to school and
more likely to walk. This effect is likely to result from parents’ increased comfort allowing
children to walk when they are accompanied by siblings and the increased time costs for
parents of dropping off multiple children at school.

    One consistent finding in the limited literature on children’s travel is that girls have a
more circumscribed travel world than boys which leads them to make fewer independent
and walking trips than boys (Hillman et al. 1990; O’Brien et al. 2000; McMillan 2006;
Vliet 1983). The behavior of children in this sample is contrary to the previous research.
The gender variable is not significant in the walk equation. There is some evidence that
girls are less likely to ride buses, but the effect is not strong.
Household Characteristics
At the household level, income has moderate effects on travel behavior. For example,
increasing income by 10% leads to a 2.6% decline in walking and a 2% increase in being
driven. The effects of race and ethnicity on walking are quite modest, especially given the
large differences in unadjusted walk rates by race. For example, 10% of whites walk to
school while 22% of African-American children walk. However, the apparent racial var-
iation is mostly explained by factors such as household income, density, and neighborhood
composition.

   Population density is positively associated with walking, even after accounting for trip
distance. However, the relationship is modest. A 10% increase in density for all students in
our sample would increase walk mode share by 1.2% But, before dismissing the effects of
the built environment on school trip mode choice as negligible, it is critical to remember
that the largest effect of the built environment is on distance to school. As density increases
distance to school decreases (r = 0.13, p < 0.01). Therefore the effects of the built
environment are being captured in the travel time variables.
Policy implications
Practitioners—both in planning and public health—have implemented programs to make
communities more walkable and elevate levels of everyday physical activity. For example,
grassroots efforts to encourage children to walk to school, e.g., Safe Routes to Schools,
have converged with public health efforts to increase physical activity levels in children by
having them walk to school, e.g., the Center for Disease Control’s KidsWalk-to-School
program. The net result has been increased funding to make schools more walkable
destinations.
   While these programs are key short and medium term strategies, neither affects the
variable with the most influence on walking to school—trip lengths. If policymakers want
to greatly increase the number of students walking to school, long-term strategies must
encourage schools to be located near students. Addressing the spatial distribution of stu-
dents and schools requires coordination of school, land use, and transportation planning.
This coordination is essential because there is substantial new school construction and
renovation of aging schools planned across the country. California, for example, passed
over $25 billion in new school facilities construction measures in 2002 and 2004 (Coleman
 123

Transportation (2008) 35:23–35                                                             31
2004). New Jersey is implementing nearly $9 billion in school construction (New Jersey
Schools Construction Corporation 2005). Ohio recently began a 4-year, $10.5 billion
program (Gurwitt 2004). This represents a major infrastructure investment and planners
need to be a part of the process.
   Pressure from smart growth advocates has already started the dialogue between school
and land use planners. The Council of Educational Facility Planners International (CEFPI)
and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (2004) authored a guide to advise
facility planners on how their projects can fit with smart growth goals; EPA also com-
missioned a study of how school siting affects air quality and community design (Ewing
and Greene 2003); and the National Trust for Historic Preservation (2003) documented the
benefits of retaining small schools in existing areas rather than building on the fringe of
communities. These efforts are important, but they often fail to critically evaluate how land
use will affect school travel (Ewing and Greene 2003, is an exception). To address this gap,
I consider how a land use and school planning policy emphasizing community schools, i.e.,
schools located within a neighborhood and easily accessible for most students, will impact
children’s school travel. The previously developed model provides a means of testing how
this policy could affect walk mode shares for the school trip.
Community schools
Until June 2004, the school siting guidelines of the CEFPI recommended one acre of land
for every 100 students plus ten acres for an elementary school, 20 acres for a middle
school, and 30 acres for a high school (CEFPI 1991). These guidelines were not context
sensitive and required large campuses which, in many communities, could only be
accommodated at the edge of town. These size requirements made it difficult for schools to
be integrated into the community leading to long distances between home and school and
low walking rates (Ewing and Greene 2003; National Trust for Historic Preservation
2003). New guidelines from CEFPI remove size standards allowing much more flexibility
in school design (CEFPI 2004). In addition, the organization has encouraged educational
facility planners to consider smart growth in their school designs (CEFPI and EPA 2004).
   Advocates of smart growth and walking to school have encouraged districts to use this
new flexibility to build community schools. The idea harks back to Perry’s (1939) vision of
neighborhood units which contain an elementary school and ample play space. This type of
design makes it possible for most children to live within walking distance of school. From
a transportation perspective, community schools affect trip lengths by decreasing the
distance from home to school. Therefore to understand how a shift to community schools
might affect walking behavior, I created scenarios that specify each student’s distance to
school. These scenarios estimated each student’s likelihood of walking given the trip
length and then averaged over the sample to estimate the expected walk mode share. For
example, one scenario estimates walk mode share if all students in the sample lived exactly
1.6 km (1 mile) from school. While this is unrealistic, it gives a good sense of the
sensitivity of mode choice to distance.
   With the current trip length distribution, the model predicts that 12% of students in the
sample will walk to school. Changing the proportion of children walking to school requires
large decreases in how far children travel to school. For example, if all children lived a
0.8 km (0.5 miles) from their school the model estimates that 34% would walk (Fig. 1). If
students lived 1.6 km (1 mile) from their school, 19% would walk. These estimates assume

all other factors, such as density, remain constant. In reality, places where community
schools are possible also have higher-densities and lower auto ownership.
    Using distance to school as a criterion in school siting and renovation decisions would
give individual communities a chance to increase walking to school. Building schools near
students—within 1–2 km—will result in more students walking and potentially in health
benefits. Overall walking rates do not change if the maximum distance to school is 4 or
5 km. This places severe constraints on the size of the ‘community’ that can support a
school.
    A few simple calculations show the community schools model is only possible at
moderate to high densities. A maximum walk distance of 1.6 km (1 mile) requires that all
students live in an eight square kilometer area (3 mi2); a maximum walk distance of 0.8 km
(0.5 miles) equates to an area of two square kilometers (0.8 mi2), assuming circular
neighborhoods. If schools must draw from a larger area to get enough students, the model
predicts no change in overall walk rates (because the majority of the students would live
beyond a walkable distance). This finding means that community schools are only possible
at moderate to high densities with large numbers of school-age children in small geo-
graphic areas. For example, in an area with 190 persons per square kilometer (500 persons/
mi2), only fifty elementary school-aged children would be expected to live within a 0.8 km
(0.5 miles) radius of a school (assuming the U.S. average of 12% of the population being
elementary school aged). That is hardly enough to support a one-room schoolhouse,
nevermind a conventional elementary school. To create a viable elementary school of 300
students living within 1.6 km (1 mile) becomes possible at densities greater than 400
people per square kilometer (1,000 persons/mi2). To have students live within a kilometer
(0.5 miles) of their school, densities must be closer to 1,500.
    The NHTS data show that 36% of households with children 6 to 15 live at densities of
less than 400 people per square kilometer (1,000 persons/mi2) and 64% live at densities of
less than 1,500 people per square kilometer (4,000 persons/mi2). This means that the
community schools model is not a possibility in many existing communities. But, the
scenarios do show that dense, new communities can plan around distance to school, and
provide another argument for retrofitting schools in dense, urban locations rather than
moving them. The information above also suggests that community schools work best at
the elementary level. The smaller size of elementary schools allows smaller, more
walkable, attendance zones.
    Finally, planners must address the equity impacts of community schools. Many schools,
particularly schools in low-income, urban areas, are already very segregated; and national
statistics also reflect a trend toward resegregation of schools (Orfield 2001; Rickles et al.
2004). Assigning children to community schools may only exacerbate this problem in areas

Transportation (2008) 35:23–35                                                               33
with high levels of residential segregation. Consider that the primary method for deseg-
regating schools after the Brown decision was to switch children from their neighborhood
school. While it could be argued that residential segregation should be tackled directly
rather than making schools deal with it, planners and advocates for walking to school need
to consider the equity impacts of community schools. In addition, because schools are
spatially fixed and have long lives, decisions made about school siting today will have
long-term effects. It may make sense to plan and build walkable schools, even if current
levels of residential segregation preclude assigning today’s students simply based on
geography.
Conclusions
Analysis of the mode choice model identifies three key findings, which may be useful to
researchers seeking to understand children’s travel behavior and policymakers seeking to
increase the proportion of children walking to school.
   #1: Travel time, and therefore distance, has the strongest effect on mode choice. When
choosing modes for the school trip, families largely appear to be minimizing their chil-
dren’s, and often their own, travel time. Children are also much more sensitive to walk
travel time than auto, reflecting the fact that most people are not willing to walk long
distances. The large impact of walk travel time on mode choice suggests that large
numbers of students will walk to school only when they live close to school. Given that
over 80% of students currently live more than 1.5 km from their schools, this is a
significant obstacle to current policies designed to increase walking rates.
   #2: Gender and race do not have large effects on mode choice. Basic averages and
previous research have suggested that gender and race should have a strong effect on mode
choice. The model shows that race has no effect on mode and that gender has a very weak
effect, and one in the opposite direction of previous findings.
   #3: Dense places encourage walking to school. Density has a weak positive association
with walking to school. But density has its strongest effect on mode choice through trip
distance. As density increases, children tend to live closer to their schools.
   Long trip lengths are one of the primary reasons many students do not walk to school
today. Programs addressing the safety of walking to school, such as SR2S, are key short-
term strategies but they do not address the spatial distribution of students and schools. If
policymakers want to substantially increase walking rates, the analyses and policy sce-
narios suggest that placing schools in neighborhoods is an effective policy option. The
scenarios show that large increases in walk mode share could be achieved if most students
lived within 1–2 km of their school. But there are some important caveats. First, com-
munity schools are only possible at moderate to high densities where there are enough
students living in small geographic areas to fill classrooms. In addition, the community
school model is best suited for elementary education because these schools are smaller and
are better-suited to smaller areas. Finally, advocates for community schools have not
discussed the potential equity impacts of this policy. In areas with high levels of residential
segregation, community schools could increase school segregation.
   These findings suggest a need for better integration of land use, transportation, and
school planning. Including children’s distance from school as a planning criterion could be
an effective way to change community design and encourage walking. This coordination is
most necessary in moderate and high-density areas and places designing large-scale
                                                                                    123

developments. However, even in low-density areas, planners can optimize school and
development placement so that a large portion of students live within a walkable distance
of their school.
