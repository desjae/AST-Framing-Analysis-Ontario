     example greater parking facility density. The most substantial
     contribution to children’s overall ALIFE was household income, those
     from the lowest household group having almost 2 h less ALIFE per-week
     than those from the highest income.
Introduction
Over the past decade, there has been increasing attention in the scienti<U+FB01>c literature directed towards
exploring children’s active lifestyles and travel characteristics. The major focus has been on active
school travel (AST) (non-motorised transport mode, for example: walking, cycling or human-pow-
ered scootering), in Western (Chillón et al. 2009; Mcdonald 2007; Van Goeverden and De Boer
2013; Pojani and Boussauw 2014) and non-Western (Irawan and Sumi 2011; Mori, Armada, and
Willcox 2012; De Kadt et al. 2014; Zhang, Yao, and Liu 2017) contexts. Despite the well-documen-
ted physiological and psychosocial bene<U+FB01>ts of AST (Van Sluijs et al. 2009; Lubans et al. 2011; Rama-
nathan et al. 2014; Leung and Loo 2017), there has been a general decline of AST rates around the
world (Prevention 2005; Garrard 2009; Shaw et al. 2015). The second major focus has been on chil-
dren’s physical activity (PA) as part of their total daily of weekly activities; for example, including
both active travelling and participation in sport/play (i.e. PA comprising both discretionary and
non-discretionary purposes) (Alexander et al. 2005; Van Sluijs et al. 2009; Lubans et al. 2011).
After all, higher levels of PA achieved through AST and extra-curricular activities have many
bene<U+FB01>ts for children’s health and <U+FB01>tness (Armstrong and Van Mechelen 2008). However, a notable
decline occurs around the time children end primary school (Reilly 2016), which is a major cause
for concern among parents, educators and policymakers alike.

   An important explanatory factor for AST is the proliferation of neighbourhood environments
that prioritise car use over walking, cycling and public transport (Rothman et al. 2018). This causes
a vicious cycle between increased tra<U+FB03>c <U+FB02>ow and increased perceptions of tra<U+FB03>c danger, which may
impact children’s active travel. Some contributing factors to decreased AST include: (1) increases in
car ownership, (2) driving children to school perceived as being more convenient, and (3) school
catchment areas (i.e. the geographic area from which children are eligible to attend a local school)
increasing, which, in turn, means the average distance children are living from their school has
increased (Fyhri et al. 2011). Meanwhile, compact, highly interconnected and walkable neighbour-
hoods have been shown to encourage rates of both AST and PA in young people (Molina-García
et al. 2017; Leung et al. 2019). These neighbourhoods often have better access to sport and leisure
facilities, such as parks and playgrounds (Giles-Corti et al. 2009).
   Many other factors have been shown to in<U+FB02>uence AST levels in children. Key factors include sex,
where girls have commonly been identi<U+FB01>ed to be less active in travelling to school and partake in
shorter durations of sport activities than boys (Mello and Worrell 2010), as well as showing greater
reductions in physical activity during adolescence than boys (Dumith et al. 2011). As an individual
level, Santos et al. (2009) identi<U+FB01>ed a positive association between lower BMI with participation in
guided sports activities. Household-level factors are also shown to be important in predicting AST,
for example children are likely to make over half of their school trips with a family member (Mcdo-
nald 2008). Household car ownership has been consistently associated with less active travel to des-
tinations for children (Waygood, Sun, and Letarte 2015; Zhang, Yao, and Liu 2017), and as car
ownership is lower for lower income households, this can have an indirect positive impact on health
by increasing active travel. Children from middle-income households have been shown to partici-
pate in more sport activities out of school than their counterparts of lower socio-economic status
(Holloway and Pimlott-Wilson 2014; Karsten 2015). This calls for further work to examine whether
the relationship will hold for an active lifestyle concept.
   There are other important considerations for AST, as both geographical location and culture
may hold di<U+FB00>erences for AST in children within di<U+FB00>erent contexts globally. For example, the neigh-
bourhood-built environment has been found to have signi<U+FB01>cant importance for AST in children
from studies in North America (Mitra and Buliung 2015) and Australia (Timperio et al. 2006). Con-
tinental di<U+FB00>erences between the physical environment and AST were found between North Amer-
ican, Australian and European children (D’haese et al. 2015).
   The research described above highlights the importance for further exploration of the built
environment and AST between di<U+FB00>erent countries, where consistencies between study design,
methods and data collection allow. We have also highlighted that there is little understanding of
the in<U+FB02>uence of children’s formal extracurricular activities on levels of AST, for example after
school tutoring, music or sports lessons, as well as cultural di<U+FB00>erences in these. Much of the litera-
ture has examined either AST (e.g.(Lubans et al. 2011; Rothman et al. 2018)) or extracurricular
activities individually (e.g. (Covay and Carbonaro 2010; Mello and Worrell 2010; De Meester
et al. 2017)). AST and extracurricular activities may be associated either negatively or positively
on both outcomes through constraints on children’s time, tiredness or through a more active life-
style. One of the few studies combining AST and extracurricular activities found that taking part in
extracurricular activities decreased active travel for Canadian students due to the incurrence of time
cost through total activity participation (Wong et al. 2011b).
   This study is innovative in being the <U+FB01>rst that compares and contrasts children’s active lifestyles
with travel journeys for school children, home to school distance, AST occurrence, as well as the
e<U+FB00>ect of the neighbourhood environment and other in<U+FB02>uences for three cities within developed
economies but with variant urban form and travel characteristics. This study will explore and com-
pare these for children living in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong. Despite many di<U+FB00>erences
between the cities, evidence suggests that the e<U+FB00>ect of urban environments, such as green space
within low-income areas and a range of health outcomes, presents similar associations within
Hong Kong, Edinburgh and Glasgow (Xu et al. 2017). There is also strong empirical evidence

                                                                                      CHILDREN’S GEOGRAPHIES                3
that culture, particularly in Hong Kong middle-classes, predicts behaviours, such as AST and par-
ticipation in extracurricular activities, as opposed to the built environment (Karsten 2015). North
American studies have highlighted that parental support has the strongest independent correlated
of AST, indicating that built environment characteristics alone may not be enough to encourage
AST (Mah et al. 2017). This study provides an opportunity to understand if similar e<U+FB00>ects hold
within comparable built environment characteristics, or if ‘high rise’ living, di<U+FB00>ering social struc-
tures or parental in<U+FB02>uence hold greater in<U+FB02>uence. Systematic reviews have highlighted that incon-
sistencies among outcome measures may limit the generalisability of <U+FB01>ndings (Rothman et al. 2018).
Conceptual framework, study context and research questions
This section provides a conceptual framework to examine whether AST and formal extracurricular
activities are associated with children’s active lifestyles.
Conceptual framework
A conceptual framework for the study is shown in Figure 1. This comparative study of three cities
examines children’s active lifestyles and their association with the relevant individual, household
and neighbourhood-level attributes, with reference to the multi-scale framework suggested in
Becky P Y Loo et al. (2017b, 2017c) and in accordance with the discussion in the previous section.
The multi-level structure within the conceptual framework consists of three circles that represent
the individual scale, the household scale and the neighbourhood scale. Individual-level attributes
relate to the participant himself/herself, such as age (in years) and sex (male or female). Their
AST and participation in activities (including PA) are also considered under the individual-level,
measured in minutes participated, as well as whether they are overweight/obese. Each individual
resides within a household, each having household-level attributes such as household car ownership

et al. 2017b, 2017c).

(yes or no), monthly household income (three categories), number of siblings in the household, as
well as parental work status (whether one or both parents work). Each household, in turn, is situ-
ated within a particular neighbourhood, which will have varying neighbourhood-level attributes
such as public transport connections, car parks and recreational facilities (measured by number),
street connectivity (measured by intersection density), green spaces (measured by proportion)
and land use mix (measured by the presence of more than one land use).
Study context
This study considers the active lifestyles of children in three cities: Glasgow (UK), Edinburgh (UK)
and Hong Kong (China). The Cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh are the two largest council areas in
Scotland (City of Edinburgh population 518,500; Glasgow City 626,410) (National Records of Scot-
land 2016). Scotland, and in particular Glasgow City, has relatively high mortality rates that are
explained by decades of deindustrialisation, deprivation and poverty (Walsh et al. 2017). Both Glas-
gow (3400 per km2) and Edinburgh (1830 per km2) are densely populated cities but not on a scale
similar to megacities in Europe (e.g. London) or worldwide (e.g. New York City, Hong Kong).
    On average, children in Scotland spent 73 min per day in PA (moderate to vigorous), boys exhi-
bit signi<U+FB01>cantly higher levels than girls and there is no socioeconomic patterning (Mccrorie, Mitch-
ell, and Ellaway 2018); these patterns are similar to children living in the rest of the UK and Europe.
AST for Scottish children is associated with higher overall moderate to vigorous PA throughout the
day compared to children using motorised modes for school travel (Alexander et al. 2005). Car use
for travel is high in the UK, chosen due to cultural- or preference-related in<U+FB02>uences as much as
structural factors. Barriers to active travel include those arising from weather and hills (which
are prominent in Glasgow and Edinburgh and contribute to their wet climate) (Kirby and Inchley
2009), as well as perceptions of risks of tra<U+FB03>c and ‘stranger danger’ (Lorenc et al. 2008). The Scot-
tish Government and Chief Medical O<U+FB03>cer (CMO) of Scotland have identi<U+FB01>ed AST as one key way
for children to meet their recommended daily physical activity through policies such as ‘A More
Active Scotland: Building a Legacy from the Commonwealth Games’ (Scottish Government 2014),
which states: ‘Promoting active travel on the school journey can make a positive contribution
and complement policy and related initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles and physical activity’.
    In contrast, Hong Kong is a highly dense and motorised city with a population of over 7 million
and an urban form that is characterised primarily by vertical, rather than horizontal, development
(Lau, Giridharan, and Ganesan 2005; Yao and Loo 2016; Leung et al. 2019). Vertical developments
in Hong Kong are common in terms of skyscrapers that often also have multiple land uses, such as
residential, commercial and transportation, combined within one structure. This verticality can be
described as the de<U+FB01>ning character of the city (Lau, Giridharan, and Ganesan 2005). Given that
Hong Kong’s borders are settled by its coastline and northern border with mainland China, lateral,
lower-rise urban sprawl-type development is simply not possible, much like the predicament of
Manhattan in New York City (Johnson 2020). Hong Kong’s children are typically raised in high-
rise apartments within compact neighbourhood environments. Public spaces and facilities available
for children’s out-of-home activities are quite limited, perfunctory and lacking in creativity (Kar-
sten 2015; Loo and Lam 2015). The parenting style of Chinese parents is highly protective in nature
(Lim and Skinner 2012) and government policy in Hong Kong concurs in recommending that chil-
dren be supervised by an adult on the road and in the neighbourhood until aged 12 years or older
(Transport Department 2018). This Chinese mind-set remains at odds with a number of European
countries where high level of independent mobility among children has historically been encour-
aged and seen as highly desirable, such as in Germany, England and the Nordic countries, but
has been declining over the past decades (Shaw et al. 2015).
    Some scholars have considered the overarching ‘sport culture’ of a location when investigating
PA prevalence (Hertting and Karlefors 2013). Sit, Lindner, and Sherrill (2002) quite bluntly points
out that Hong Kong’s culture is ‘not at all a sporty or physically active one’, where the main emphasis
is on academic success coupled with upward mobility in society, and this is further exempli<U+FB01>ed by

                                                                        CHILDREN’S GEOGRAPHIES        5
Hong Kong’s rather low average moderate to vigorous PA participation (Sallis et al. 2016). Despite
this, the busy schedule of sport activities after school and on weekends among Hong Kong children
means that they have a considerable level of PA participation coming from their extracurricular
activities (K Y.K. Leung et al. 2019). There are also PA opportunities within the local school curri-
culum as Hong Kong schools are expected to provide two physical education (PE) sessions per
week, lasting 35–40 min each, as well as morning and afternoon recesses where children can
‘run around and play at school’ (GovHK 2011).
Objectives
Rooted in the conceptual framework, the study objectives were as follows:
(1) Create an active lifestyle variable (ALIFE) measured in terms of total minutes of AST and extra-
     curricular activities.
(2) Explore how children’s active lifestyles (ALIFE) are associated with di<U+FB00>erent attributes at the
     individual, household and neighbourhood levels outlined in our conceptual framework, and
     how these relationships di<U+FB00>er across the three cities.
(3) Explore di<U+FB00>erences in AST and participation in extracurricular activities for children living in
     Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong.
Methods
Data collection
The data collected for this comparative study of three cities involve two independent cross-sectional
surveys and spatial data from two survey databases comprising the three cities of Glasgow, Edin-
burgh and Hong Kong.
Surveys
Based on the conceptual framework, comparative variables were identi<U+FB01>ed and obtained from two
datasets that contained data of children’s active lifestyles, speci<U+FB01>cally the child’s school travel
characteristics (travel time and main mode), reported extracurricular activities (organised leisure
activities outside of school, for example: community group, team or individual sport coaching/les-
sons and art/performance lessons) (weekly participation duration), residence location (to calculate
network distance to school), child’s sex and household socio-economic characteristics (parental
work status, income and car ownership).
   For the cities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, data are from the Studying Physical Activity in Chil-
dren’s Environments across Scotland (SPACES) study. The SPACES study investigated the physical
activity of a sub-sample of 10–11-year olds who participated in the eighth sweep of a large-scale
cohort study, Growing Up in Scotland (GUS). Data collection took place between May 2015 and
May 2016 as part of a follow-up to the GUS study and children were asked to complete a detailed
travel diary of their daily mode of travel to and from school. More details of the rationale and survey
administration procedures are available on the website (http://spaces.sphsu.mrc.ac.uk/), associated
publications and the full report (Mccrorie and Ellaway 2017; Olsen et al. 2019). The Scottish data
included children from the cities of Glasgow (N = 93) and Edinburgh (N = 70).
   The Hong Kong data are based on a school survey conducted across four primary schools
between November 2015 and June 2016. With the help of a team of research assistants, participating
children answered a questionnaire and also brought a separate questionnaire home for their parents
to <U+FB01>ll in. Proportionate strati<U+FB01>ed sampling, based on private and public schools, has been con-
ducted; and more details about the Hong Kong school survey can be found in K Y.K. Leung and
Loo (2017). The Hong Kong children included in this study (N = 172) were selected based on

6        J. R. OLSEN ET AL.
the age range (aged 10–11 years) to correspond with the readily available data for the SPACES study
in Scotland. Both databases also included data about children’s measured height and weight, BMI
was calculated to represent the physical pro<U+FB01>le of each participating child. BMI is considered as a
potential associated factor of children’s physical activity and therefore could contribute to their
overall active lifestyle (Schwarz<U+FB01>scher et al. 2017).
Neighbourhood environment
Neighbourhood contextual information was collected mainly from OpenStreetMap (OpenStreet-
Map 2018) across the three cities for comparison purposes and supplemented by local government
sources (Scottish Goverment 2016; Department 2018; Sport Scotland 2018). Although the range of
neighbourhood environmental variables available is quite broad, this paper has selectively con-
sidered <U+FB01>ve main categories (as per Wong, Faulkner, and Buliung (2011a)) to include in the analy-
sis: distance to school, neighbourhood density, diversity, design and aesthetics. The data required
for calculating distance to school have been discussed in the previous sub-section. Population data
were obtained from the 2011 censuses by Tertiary Planning Unit (TPU) in Hong Kong (Census and
Statistics Department 2011) and data zone in Scotland (National Records of Scotland 2016), the
smallest comparable data collection units in the respective location, as a measure of population den-
sity. In terms of diversity, land use data were obtained to prepare a land use mix measure. For
neighbourhood design, the availability of public transit, sport and play facilities and car parks
were collected, as was number of intersections. Aesthetics-wise, the proportion of open and
green space areas (including parks and playgrounds) was calculated as a representation of greenery
in the neighbourhood. With reference to the neighbourhood portion of the multi-scale framework
of this paper (Figure 1), these chosen neighbourhood environment variables have been adapted and
improved from Kevin YK Leung and Loo (2020), which utilised a selection of these variables in their
study on AST in Hong Kong.
Data processing and analysis
This section describes the preparation and processing of the variables for data analysis, as well as the
methods of analysis used. For all variables we selected datasets and procedures that could be per-
formed in all three cities using the same contextual data.
Preparation of neighbourhood environment variables
For data preparation, neighbourhood-level data were organised into the variables outlined above. A
detailed description of the built environmental variables and sources are contained within Sup-
plementary Table S1. Spatial coordinates of home and school locations were used to calculate net-
work walking distances between these locations using the gmapsdistance package in Rv3.5.1 (the
shortest walking distance calculated using the Google Maps distance matrix API using road and
path network). For each residence location, 500-metre Euclidean bu<U+FB00>ers were created in ESRI Arc-
Map 10.3, as respective estimations of the immediate neighbourhoods (Loo, Cheng, and Nichols
2017a; Loo and Du Verle 2017), which is a commonly used boundary in studies of the built environ-
ment. Bu<U+FB00>er analysis was conducted to <U+FB01>nd the number of points and proportion of polygons within
the bu<U+FB00>er areas, and overlaid on the respective Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong base maps to
represent the neighbourhood form surrounding children’s home locations, namely public transit
availability, public sport and play locations, car parking facilities, open and green space area and
number of road intersections, as a proxy measure for street connectivity (Wong, Faulkner, and
Buliung 2011a; Wang and Wen 2017). A land use mix measure was created to include whether
the home neighbourhood included an education, government or commercial facility (inconsistent
residential building data meant we were unable to create a more sophisticated measure, such as a

                                                                        CHILDREN’S GEOGRAPHIES         7
Diversity Index). Population density was calculated by dividing the 2011 census population by the
area for the TPU or data zone within which each child resided.
Statistical analysis
To study active lifestyles as conceptualised in the framework illustrated in Figure 1, we created an
active lifestyle variable (ALIFE). The ALIFE variable measured the total number of minutes of AST
and extracurricular activities per week for individual children. The ALIFE variable was calculated by
totalling the weekly minutes spent in extracurricular activities (all participants, as captured in the
survey) with the daily home to school walking time calculated for children who reported AST for all
journeys (multiplied by 5 for a weekly measure).
    For the main continuous study outcome, a linear regression model was used. The secondary out-
come of interest was participation in AST, as a binary variable (yes/no) for all journeys to and from
home to school. As this outcome was binary, logistic regression models were used. To improve the
precision of the standard errors of the coe<U+FB03>cients of the models, bootstrapping was also applied, at
500 repetitions. Originally, to account for possible similarity between the Scottish cities, clustering
on region was considered, but this resulted in over-speci<U+FB01>cation of the models. Multi-level modes
were not performed as we did not have su<U+FB03>cient sample size at the country (n:2) or city level (n:3).
Evidence has suggested error and bias resulting from multi-level models where groups are less than
50 (Maas and Hox 2005). We, therefore, used <U+FB01>xed e<U+FB00>ects as we were interested in possible region/
city-speci<U+FB01>c in<U+FB02>uences. We computed the variance in<U+FB02>ation factor (VIF) for each of the <U+FB01>nal
models to test for multi-collinearity of variables, which were all less than 10. In all the main
e<U+FB00>ect-only models, VIF was under 5. In the interaction models where extra inter-variable corre-
lation is likely, the VIF was under 10.
    For both the main and secondary outcome models, two sets of models were run, one including
region, and the other, city. All independent variables were entered in the model, then simpli<U+FB01>ed by
removing non-signi<U+FB01>cant terms (at 0.05 level) individually, highest p-values <U+FB01>rst. Of the indepen-
dent variables, only sex was treated as a confounder and always retained in the model. Any variables
that were found to be signi<U+FB01>cant at the end of the selection process were checked for interaction
with city/region. From these models, interaction plots were produced to explore the e<U+FB00>ect of
these signi<U+FB01>cant variables and how they may moderate AST. All analyses were performed in StataSE
14, and alpha was taken as 5%.
Results
Overall, the mean number of minutes per week children, participated in AST and extracurricular
activities combined within the ALIFE variable, was 355 min. ALIFE varied by city, where children
in Glasgow had greater ALIFE than Edinburgh and Hong Kong (Table 1). There was variation in
ALIFE by household income, children in the highest income category displaying 114.6 mean min-
utes greater than those in the lowest income category. AST contribution to total ALIFE (mean by
city) varied: 11.1% (Glasgow), 18.6% (Edinburgh) and 13.7% (Hong Kong) (Table 2). Children,
whose parents owned a car and were both employed, had a higher mean ALIFE.
    The mean AST (all trips to and from school active) for all cities was 37.4%, Hong Kong children
reported lower than average AST (34.3%) (Table 1). Glasgow was similar to average AST (39.8%)
and children living in Edinburgh displayed the highest AST (47.1%). AST was higher for children
who had a lower household income, where parents did not own a car, and if both parents did not
work. The characteristic with the greatest change in AST between categories was distance to school;
children living closest to school having higher proportion of AST (64.5%) compared to those living
over 2 km away (22.9%).
    There was little variation in the home to school travel time (minutes) for children across all three
cities (Table 3). The network distance was similar for Glasgow and Edinburgh but notably at least

two times higher for children living in Hong Kong. Environmental characteristics that varied and
were considerably higher for children’s home environment (500 m) in Hong Kong were number of
road junctions, public transit stops and population density. The number of sport and play facilities
(public) within 500 m of children’s homes were higher for children living in Glasgow and Edin-
burgh compared to Hong Kong.
     Children in Hong Kong had signi<U+FB01>cantly less weekly ALIFE than those in Scotland (Edinburgh/
Glasgow combined: coef: -95.13, 95% CI -140.1 to -44.2) and Glasgow (coef: -109.36, 95% CI
-181.13 to -37.59) (Table 4). The main e<U+FB00>ect model showed that household income held a signi<U+FB01>-
cant in<U+FB02>uence over a child’s ALIFE, a high-income household having a higher mean weekly ALIFE
compared to lower income (coef 115.3, 95% CI 41.68–188.8). There were no di<U+FB00>erence in ALIFE
between boys and girls. Few of the built environment and individual levels showed signi<U+FB01>cant
e<U+FB00>ect on ALIFE, the full model including all variables is presented in Supplementary Table S2.
     Testing a model, which included only city, and one that included only region, indicated no
di<U+FB00>erences between cities (0.125) or regions (0.072). Examination of the responses indicated that
city was a three-level version of region, which would explain the model over-speci<U+FB01>cation that
arose when trying to cluster on city. Therefore, Glasgow and Edinburgh were combined for the
<U+FB01>nal analysis and presented in Table 5. Few of the built environment and individual levels showed
signi<U+FB01>cant e<U+FB00>ect on AST, the full model including all variables is presented in Supplementary
Table S3.
     Children living in Hong Kong had lower odds of AST compared to Scotland (OR: 0.52, 95% CI
0.29–0.93), for households that owned a car (OR: 0.40, 95% CI 0.21–0.76) and for areas with a
greater number of parking facilities around the home (OR: 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.97) – this may
be an indicator of densely populated areas (Table 3). Distance from home to school was an impor-
tant predictor of AST, where the likelihood of AST decreased as home to school distance increased.
Participation in extracurricular activities was not a predictor for AST in our model.
     Figures 2 and 3 display interaction plots of the marginal e<U+FB00>ects, illustrating the predicted prob-
ability of AST by number of parking facilities (within 500 m of child’s home) and by each distance
category. In general, the odds of AST were higher where the distance travelled is shorter, as expected
(Figure 2). However, it is interesting that (1) increasing number of parking facilities decreases the
probability of AST within both countries distance categories; and (2) this is not a constant increas-
ing linear e<U+FB00>ect in Hong Kong, with reduced gains after a certain point (Figure 3).

Discussion
Main <U+FB01>ndings
This study aimed to create, and created, a children’s active lifestyles (ALIFE) variable for use in
international comparison studies that combined weekly number of minutes actively travelling to
and from school (AST) and participating in extracurricular activities. Using this novel ALIFE vari-
able, we were able to answer our second research question which explored whether children’s active
lifestyles were associated with di<U+FB00>erent individual, household and neighbourhood attributes. We
found that children in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong had a mean weekly ALIFE of
355 min (5.9 h). ALIFE varied by city, those living in Glasgow and Edinburgh participated in
over an hour more ALIFE per-week than those in Hong Kong. We found the most substantial deter-
minant of ALIFE was household income, those from the lowest household income group having
almost 2 h less ALIFE per-week than those from the highest income.
     Our <U+FB01>nal study aim was to explore di<U+FB00>erences in AST and participation in extracurricular activi-
ties for children living in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong. We found there were city-level
di<U+FB00>erences in the overall proportion of AST between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong.
Where the data were pooled at a regional level, we found the odds of AST were 48% lower in
Hong Kong, once adjusted for individual and household level variables. Participation in extracur-
ricular activities did not in<U+FB02>uence levels of AST across any of the three cities.

Comparison with the existing literature
Here, we considered multiple factors that contribute to a child’s total active lifestyle (ALIFE); AST
and extracurricular activities, as well the in<U+FB02>uence of home location and neighbourhood character-
istics. Recent studies have explored whether energy used via PA during daily travel may have a

direct impact on other daily activities, for example less need or time for other kinds of activity, as
well as spending time within neighbourhood green space (Stefansdottir, Næss, and Ihlebæk 2019).
A study of adults concluded that the most signi<U+FB01>cant factor for a physically active lifestyle was dis-
tance from the central business areas, an association with household income was not found. Here,
we found that household income was the most signi<U+FB01>cant in<U+FB02>uence of ALIFE for children. A pre-
vious study of Hong Kong children found that households with more educated parents and with a
higher income participated in more extracurricular activities (Lau and Cheng 2016). This pattern
was similar in the UK context where disadvantaged children were less likely to take part in organ-
ised out-of-school activities, speci<U+FB01>cally for activities where additional parent/guardian payment
was required (music lesson, sport club and extra tuition) (Tanner et al. 2016) – for pre- and
post-school clubs, there was similar uptake regardless of income. It is important to note that our
study captured only ‘formal’ extracurricular activities and participation in informal outdoor play
and sport may di<U+FB00>er by household income. We recommend further research captures the speci<U+FB01>c
extracurricular activity.
    Similar to other studies, home to school distance had a signi<U+FB01>cant in<U+FB02>uence on the likelihood of
AST in all three cities but not ALIFE, we found the likelihood of AST decreased for children living
over 1 km from their school. A study of 10-year-old English school children found the threshold dis-
tance that best discriminated walkers from passive commuters was 1.4 km (Chillón et al. 2015). This
<U+FB01>nding was similar to the distance found here that highlighted a change in the likelihood of AST.
Home to school distance has been found to be the most signi<U+FB01>cant environment factor for AST in
a large number of studies (Curtis, Babb, and Olaru 2015; Zhang, Yao, and Liu 2017; Rothman
et al. 2018), and research has suggested that for primary school-aged children this is often due to
parents considering over 20 min beyond their child’s capacity to walk on a school day (Ahern
et al. 2017). Further research is required to better understand whether children are actually capable,
or even enjoy walking these distances (or longer distances) to school. We tested a number of built
environment and individual variables within our model and found few held importance for both
ALIFE and AST. It may be helpful to look to the literature to explain this result, such as Timperio
et al. (2004) or Handy, Cao, and Mokhtarian (2006), that both found perceptions of good recreational
and public transit facilities in the neighbourhood to be associated with more active behaviour. Con-
sequently, it isincreasingly important to consider not only the quantity of neighbourhood facilities but
also perceived quality. Further research is required for better understanding how people perceive the
convenience of access public transit, recreational facilities and green spaces, in order to more com-
prehensively consider how active lifestyles are associated with the neighbourhood environment.
    Children from households reporting car ownership had a 60% lower likelihood of AST than
those without car ownership. Car ownership is socially patterned where individuals from lower
socio-economic position are less likely to own a car (Kingham, Pearce, and Zawar-Reza 2007).
However, our research suggests that not owning a car can provide an unintended health bene<U+FB01>t
through increased PA and time spent outdoors being active, potential contribution to protecting
and improving health for those whose health status tends to be worse, this result is similar to pre-
vious a previous study of Scottish adults’ active travel (Olsen et al. 2017). Australian research has
shown that disadvantaged neighbourhoods have more exposure to tra<U+FB03>c but greater connectivity
and transit access (Rachele et al. 2017). Street connectivity was measured in our study by proxy
using road junction density. We found an increased likelihood of AST travel in areas with higher
road junction density, corroborating <U+FB01>ndings in the scienti<U+FB01>c literature and con<U+FB01>rming the impor-
tance of <U+FB01>ne-grained, pedestrian-friendly urban design (Pojani and Boussauw 2014). In Glasgow 2%
of children reported they did not have access to a car, this small number of children (exact number
not reported to avoid potential disclosable information) also reported AST for all journeys to and
from school. Although this may seem surprisingly high, this may be expected for two reasons, <U+FB01>rstly
very small numbers in this sub-sample, and secondly, in Glasgow, the average distance to a primary
school is small and more likely to be travelled actively (72% of Scottish children aged between 4 and
11 travelled less than 2 km to school (Transport Scotland 2016)).

                                                                         CHILDREN’S GEOGRAPHIES     13
    On a closely related note, we found that where the number of parking facilities increased, the
probability of AST rapidly decreased and other research has suggested that parking availability
in Asia is associated with more car trips (Yin, Shao, and Wang 2018). The authors of this study
also suggested that implementing parking restrictions at journey origins and destinations could
encourage more sustainable travel, while our study goes one-step further in suggesting that this
could also promote more travel that is active through discouraging car use (Yin, Shao, and
Wang 2018).
Strengths and weaknesses
Our study has a number of strengths. The analysis utilised a comparable sample of school-aged chil-
dren from two cities in Scotland and Hong Kong, meaning that although the design is cross-sec-
tional, therefore, unable to ascertain causality, they provide similar results in contrasting
geographic contexts that further the generalisability of our <U+FB01>ndings. We were able to create a
new active lifestyle variable (ALIFE) for children living in three cities, this variable combined num-
ber of minutes travelling to and from school and participating in extracurricular activities. We were
unable to measure participation in physically active extracurricular activities only, which is an
important dimension of children’s total extracurricular activities (Smith and Haycock 2016) and
should be investigated further.
    There were a number of similarities within the datasets, meaning a comparable ALIFE and AST
outcome, and individual and neighbourhood characteristics were generated. We included a number
of directly comparable variables identi<U+FB01>ed in our theoretical framework that were suitable for inter-
national comparison and di<U+FB00>erent contexts, which is a key strength of this study. We did not have
access to a comparable walkability measure and instead used a measure in road junction density.
    In terms of limitations, travel mode was determined via travel diary entries which may not be as
accurate as objectively measured mode of transport. Our study may be limited by the inclusion of
shortest home-to-school distance rather than actual distance which children travelled. The lack of
di<U+FB00>erences seen between cities could be due to the number of participants in the Scottish cities,
which were both around half of Hong Kong’s, meaning a lack of power to detect them, especially
as when combined some regional level di<U+FB00>erences were detected. For the ALIFE variable, we did not
know the number of minutes children travelled to and from school actively. However, we were able
to create this <U+FB01>gure using shortest network distances which estimates the number of minutes an
adult would take to walk to and from a destination for children who reported they actively travelled
all of their school journeys. By using the shortest network distance and adults’ travel speeds, it is
likely the ALIFE variable produced a conservative <U+FB01>gure.
Conclusions
This cross-region multi-city study of school children living in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Hong Kong
found that the most substantial contribution to children’s overall active lifestyle was household
income, those from the lowest household group having almost 2 h less ALIFE than those from
the highest income. A novel ALIFE variable was created that is well suited for use in international
comparisons and di<U+FB00>erent contexts. Distance to school was the most signi<U+FB01>cant environmental
indicator of AST in both geographical contexts. We found other environmental factors to be impor-
tant indicators, for example parking facility density, and contribute to the wider base evidence by
suggesting parking restrictions at journey origins and destinations could encourage more AST.
