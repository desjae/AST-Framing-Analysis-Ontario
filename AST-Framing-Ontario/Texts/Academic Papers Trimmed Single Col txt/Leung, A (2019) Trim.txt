1. Introduction

    Active travel is receiving increasing attention in transport policy, in particular, its potential bene<U+FB01>ts for public health (de Nazelle
et al., 2011; Faulkner et al., 2009; Jarrett et al., 2012; Mueller et al., 2015; Zapata-Diomedi et al., 2017). Motorisation has greatly
reduced the active travel mode share, including utility trips such as travel to school (Hillman et al., 1993; Trang et al., 2012). A safe
environment for children or adolescents is a key determinant of active travel (Tranter and Pawson, 2001). In recognition of the drop
in rates in children’s active travel (Hillman et al., 1993; Tudor-Locke et al., 2001), research into active travel in this age group has
been increasing globally (Ding et al., 2011; Herrador-Colmenero et al., 2014; Pang et al., 2017; Rojas Lopez and Wong, 2017; Sirard
and Slater, 2008), as development years form important lifelong habits and promote better health outcomes (D’Haese et al., 2015;
Falconer et al., 2015). Adolescence is an age at which travel independence is growing, but parental control remains important (Stark

et al., 2018). Another concern for adolescents is that they reach driving age as they mature towards adulthood and so they become
less likely to travel actively (Emond and Handy, 2012; Frank et al., 2007).
    While emerging economies are motorising rapidly, (Barter et al., 2003; Hickman and Banister, 2014) and active travel mode share
reducing (Trang et al., 2012), many still have higher rates of active travel or physical activity than developed counterparts (Hallal
et al., 2012). If decisive actions are not in place to retain walking, cycling, urban forms and travel habits, these are likely be replaced
by motorised modes of travel (Pojani and Stead, 2016). Developed countries are now recognising the perils of car dependence, but
entrenched urban forms and habits are di<U+FB03>cult to reverse (Newman and Kenworthy, 2015). Research into active travel and the
physical activity of children or adolescents in developing and emerging countries (in particular China) are growing (Day, 2016,
2018), however there is a disproportionately larger number of studies based on developed countries (Ding et al., 2011). In particular,
a research gap exists in this area for tropical countries in Africa and Asia (Rojas Lopez and Wong, 2017), such as Vietnam. This is one
of the main motivation for this study in which we explore how the culture of mobility and its constraints shape Vietnamese ado-
lescents’ active travel participation, using a perception based survey.
    In Vietnam, the 1986 Doi Moi market reforms opened up the once isolated and impoverished country to the world – transforming
it into a vibrant, export oriented market economy. This has greatly improved people’s livelihoods, but also bought forth rapid
motorisation. As demonstrated in Table 1, motorisation rates have rapidly increased while active travel has dropped markedly.
Motorcycles are becoming essential to Vietnamese life, and are a principal means of travel and a status symbol (Hansen, 2017; Truitt,
2008). While the car mode share remains low by global standards, ownership rates are growing as more people are able to a<U+FB00>ord
automobiles. It was estimated that in 2017, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC, also known as Saigon) had 7.3 million powered two-wheelers
(PTW is a technical term for motorcycles or scooters) while the population was around 8.6 million (Duc, 2017).
    Public transport promotes active travel, incidentally or as substitution for private motorised modes (Lachapelle et al., 2011).
However, this is a challenge in many South East Asian counties due to a lack of investment and competing funding priorities -
Vietnam is one of these examples (OECD, 2018). Cities (in particular in South East Asia) with rapid motorisation in the form of PTW
might provide a form of a<U+FB00>ordable travel, but it also makes provisions for public transport di<U+FB03>cult (Barter, 2004). Vietnam is ranked
25th out of 193 in the world, based on fatalities from road accidents (Sivak and Schoettle, 2014). In a tra<U+FB03>c saturated environment,
pedestrians and cyclists are subjected to greater risks due to their lack of protection. In Vietnamese cities, adolescents are the group
that is at the highest risk of road fatalities (Phuong et al., 2013). Unless a car restraint and public transport focused agenda is in place,
it seems that it will be di<U+FB03>cult to reverse the impact of motorisation and increasing tra<U+FB03>c (Barter, 2000). The majority of trips in
Vietnamese cities were found to be less than 5 km because of the compact urban environment. Because of these short distances, there
is great potential for motorised trips to be replaced by cycling (Huyn and Gómez-Ibáñez, 2017), however, because of the hotter
climate, people may prefer to use motorised modes. Tree cover, shade, protected walkways or bikeways can help to promote active
travel modes, but they are not common in Vietnamese cities. Another feature of Vietnamese urban areas is the higher level of informal
housing due to an in<U+FB02>ux of internal migrants from less urbanised areas who are seeking better economic opportunities. Informally
built areas tend to feature poorer quality roads with more obstructions (Seo and Kwon, 2017). Combined with PTW tra<U+FB03>c, these
make active travel less attractive. In view of the situation in Vietnam, the objective of this study is to better understand the factors
that may in<U+FB02>uence walking and cycling among adolescents in HCMC, the largest city in Vietnam. This objective is assisted by a survey
of active travel behaviour and perceptions. We employed statistical analysis (district level correlation and individual level binary
logistical regression) to help establish the associations of physical environment (natural and built), socio-demographic, and mobility
culture (individuals, peers, parents and community) factors within a comprehensive framework adapted from existing literature.

2. Literature review

    Active travel studies encompass the <U+FB01>elds of transport, health and the environment. An evidence base of the relationships among
transportation, land use and physical activity is increasingly established from existing studies which show consistent positive as-
sociations with built environment factors (higher urban density, land use mix, proximity to destinations) that are favourable to
walking or cycling (Handy, 2005; Saelens et al., 2003). This also applies to children’s or adolescent’s active travel, however, social
factors also come into play – as parenting and schooling are central to their lifestyles and travel needs. A large number of parents pick
up and/or drop o<U+FB00> their children, as was found in a study based in Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam (Tran et al., 2016). Ding et al. (2011)
reviewed and summarised the directions and associations of key variables – land use mix and residential density were the most
supported correlates for youth active travel, while parents’ safety concerns can be eased in places which are more “walkable” and
which allow independent mobility (IM).
    The physical environment (e.g., street design, density, tree cover), mobility related preferences (e.g., mode choice, comfort) and
socio-economic factors (e.g., income) have been widely assessed. Studies from the developed countries tend to o<U+FB00>er a wider coverage
of factors. Physical environmental factors are relatively well studied in developing countries but these studies tend not to include
mobility related preferences and communication (e.g., with peers, parents, community) considerations, possibly due to more limited
data collection (Day, 2016, 2018). A striking observation is that air pollution has not been greatly considered in active travel studies
in developing countries, despite their more acute pollution levels (Rojas Lopez and Wong, 2017). HCMC is one of the most polluted
cities in Vietnam due to the concentration of transport and industrial activities, posing a signi<U+FB01>cant health threat (Phung et al., 2016).
Despite such risk, studies show that the net bene<U+FB01>t of physical exercise may outweigh the impact of exposure to air pollution (Tainio
et al., 2016). A handful of adolescent active travel studies, such as those by Hatzopoulou et al. (2013) and Int Panis et al. (2010) have
considered the impact of the exposure to tra<U+FB03>c pollution during active travel. Another overlooked factor suggested by Rojas Lopez
and Wong (2017) is tropical weather. These are relevant to HCMC - located in southern Vietnam where outdoor temperatures reach
29–33 Celsius throughout the year. Nkurunziza et al. (2012) investigated the relationship between weather and cycling behaviour in
Tanzania, where a subtropical, hot, humid climate discourages cycling.
    Di<U+FB00>erent models or conceptual frameworks, for both the general population and children/adolescents, have been developed to
help understand the factors contributing to active travel in a more systematic way. The social ecological model considers how multi-
levels of interrelating factors of the physical environment (natural and built), the social/cultural environment, the policy regulatory
environment and intra-individual factors are in<U+FB02>uencing travel behaviour (Sallis et al., 2008). While this model has been the
mainstay of the analysis of active travel, it tends to assume environmental determinism, where individuals are more likely to travel
actively when there is favourable environment. On the other hand, mobility patterns are not only a product of the built environment,
but are also created by certain cultural factors. This can be explained by the mobility culture framework (Götz and De<U+FB00>ner, 2009;
Kuhnimhof and Wulfhorst, 2013), which suggests the way inhabitants travel is based on an interrelated system where travel be-
haviour is a product of the triad forces of: (i) policymaking and governance, (ii) spatial structure and transport supply and (iii)
perceptions and lifestyle orientations. The mobility culture framework is useful in this regard as it combines both “hard” and “soft”
elements of transport, and is proving useful for active travel research. In a study comparing four UK settlements, cycling rates are
higher in places where a “culture of cycling” can produce positive social reinforcement e<U+FB00>ects (Aldred and Jungnickel, 2014).
However, mobility culture framework has not been well applied in the setting of a developing country, especially at a local level, such
as suburb/district or intra-urban levels, or at household/individual level.
    While many studies assume rationality in decision making, recent research has begun to recognise that travel could be emotional
or impulsive, as developed from the notion of “emotional geography” (Anderson and Smith, 2001). Personal aspects are better
captured in travel behaviour models or theory which o<U+FB00>ers a framework that focuses on social, psychological and cognitive factors
using an individual centred view (Van Acker et al., 2010). Compared to objective measures (e.g., quantitatively measurable variables
such as travel distance, frequency, physical activity), perceptions and lifestyle aspects were less thoroughly researched, possibly due
to the less quantitative nature of this area and di<U+FB03>culties in obtaining valid data (Scheiner and Holz-Rau, 2007). Nevertheless, the
importance of perceptive factors is increasingly recognised in studies of youth active travel habits (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017a;
Oyeyemi et al., 2014; Panter et al., 2008). However, perceptive studies focusing on an Asian or a developing country setting are
relatively meagre. A particular limitation for developing countries is that the research community is less developed, as resources are
less available. In addition, reliable national or municipal statistics (such as census) for objective measures also tend not to be easily
accessible to the public. Instead of relying on secondary sources, this study aims to understand mobility culture by conducting a
perceptive study of HCMC. We aim to understand how mobility culture a<U+FB00>ects adolescents’ active travel, and to compare this with
previous studies in the literature. To date, mobility culture studies tend look at aggregated levels and usually compare between cities.
Applying the mobility culture framework into individual level is needed. Recently, Götschi (2017) attempted to synthesise a number
of active travel frameworks, namely the PASTA (Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches) framework, which
combines behavioural decision making and socio-spatial structural relationships (the social ecological layers), including mobility
culture. As shown in Fig. 1, we adapted the PASTA framework in the context of data availability and in the context of HCMC, where
the tropical climate, air pollution, street vendors and parenting in<U+FB02>uences are included. The PASTA framework acknowledges the
multiple levels of variables and various domains (society/culture, natural/built environment), and how these in<U+FB02>uence household
and individual levels, and ultimately active travel activity. The higher levels are also formed by many individuals. This framework is
comprehensive and encompassing and is used to help organise the variables and study design, which we explain in more detail in the

3. Context, methodology, and descriptive statistics

    In the global mobility culture typology assessment of 41 global cities (Wulfhorst et al., 2013), our study area HCMC is assessed as
a “tra<U+FB03>c saturated city”, alongside Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Cairo and Tehran. These cities generally have serious tra<U+FB03>c
congestion issues, are located in developing countries, feature medium to high urban density, and have limited road and public
transport infrastructure. Density does not necessarily result in higher pubic transport use, but narrow streets and saturated tra<U+FB03>c can
help in making full-sized automobiles less useful, compared with cities in the developed world which have better roads and highways.
In tra<U+FB03>c saturated cities, transport needs are often met by PTW, which are a<U+FB00>ordable, nimble and able to weave their way through
congested tra<U+FB03>c. However, this also comes at the cost of an increase in air pollution, as most PTWs are based on two-stroke engines,
and heightened road trauma risks due to lack of occupant protection. This study places greater emphasis on heavy tra<U+FB03>c and road
trauma and their impacts on the active travel of youths, along with air and weather considerations which have not often been well-
studied in prior youth travel studies.
    While it would be most useful to conduct a city-wide study in HCMC, this is not feasible due to the costs involved. Instead, we
selected nine districts with varying levels of income and urban characteristics that are within the central continuous urbanised area
and are located to the west of Saigon River. Rural areas of HCMC are not of interest in this study but could be investigated in the
future for their di<U+FB00>erences in mobility culture and travel behaviour. Based on the <U+FB01>ndings of the literature review and the active

variables and identifying households with adolescents aged 11–16 during June and July 2017, as part of a wider survey of income
and travel in HCMC. The households were randomly selected to cover di<U+FB00>erent locations within the same district, with proximity to
schools as well as recreation facilities. We also used this opportunity to ask the next of kin of the adolescents some probing questions
related to active travel, which helped in developing the travel perception survey of this study. Based on their responses, additional
variables relating to air pollution, tra<U+FB03>c and personal safety, accident experience, and street vendors were included. The supporting
literature and the relevance to mobility culture and PASTA framework are identi<U+FB01>ed, as shown in Table 2.
    The survey questions included socio-demographic variables (age, gender and household income), travel behaviour, and per-
ceptions. Perception variables are measured by a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree
and 5 = Strongly Agree). A pilot survey with 22 adolescent respondents was conducted with these questions to test the survey and
help improve the structure and wording of the <U+FB01>nal questionnaire. The households that were the respondents in the <U+FB01>rst survey were
later revisited for a second survey (n = 525), with the <U+FB01>nal active travel perception questionnaire targeting adolescents aged 11–16
during August and September 2017. The reduction of sample size in this survey is due to respondent attrition, as some were not able
to be contacted, or refused to be surveyed again. District level population and land use data were also included in this study. Several
prior researchers used objective measures to examine the dependency of active travel (such as lack of vehicle ownership), however in
our case, we used adolescents’ perceptions of factors rather than objective measures. A justi<U+FB01>cation for this is that a number of
previous studies (Alton et al., 2007; Carver et al., 2005; Frank et al., 2007; Ma and Cao, 2017) have con<U+FB01>rmed there is a close
correlation between perceptions and the physical environment objective measures. Another reason is that there is a direct e<U+FB00>ect from
perception on behaviour, rather than objective measures (Bauman et al., 2002; Handy et al., 2010). The objective measures of the
environment are in turn a<U+FB00>ected by subjective perceptions (Ma and Cao, 2017; McCormack et al., 2009).
    Fig. 2 shows the map of the nine surveyed districts and overall land use cover of HCMC. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of
the population, land use and travel characteristics. Some additional variables not considered in the statistical analysis due to lack of
statistical association are included here to provide additional information. They are leisure related land use (e.g., parks, sports
grounds) per capita and poverty level. Poverty level is based on the World Bank poverty estimates (the percentage of population with
an income lower than the 40th national percentile) as a district level socio-economic indicator. The income levels collected in the
survey resembles the district level poverty level. We were unable to compare survey income level data directly with the census. The
last census was conducted in 2009 and the data is not publicly available.
    HCMC’s urban centre is located in District 1, where resident population density has been reduced in recent years due to increased
demand for commercial and o<U+FB03>ce land uses. Denser districts include Districts 3, 4 10 and 11. The higher number of e<U+FB00>ective
(complete) samples in District 8 is possibly due to the area’s lower socio-economic level. Slums (self-built) housing in HCMC occupy
more land area than is the case in Hanoi (Seo and Kwon, 2017), and District 8 contains more slums due to its outer location. Based on
our observation, respondents in poorer districts tend to be more willing to provide active travel perceptions, anticipating that un-
dertaking the survey might help alleviate their situation. This may cause over-sampling of this district, and under-sampling of other
districts. While this is a limitation of this study, we nonetheless compared the income values with the district poverty averages and
mode share <U+FB01>gures to ensure that representation was su<U+FB03>cient.
    The land use characteristics of the districts varied considerably - Go Vap and District 1 (the city centre) has the highest road and
park availability. To the northeast, Tan Binh features the Tan Son Nhat International Airport. As the airport occupies large swathes of
land, urban density, which is measured using only the urban area rather than the whole district’s area size, is preferred. Our samples
of Tan Binh show that it is a fairly high income district, as most of the schools are located in well-o<U+FB00> areas. However, in district-wide
poverty estimates, this rapidly developing area contains some of the airport workers’ accommodation.
    To better demonstrate the “mobility culture”, we present some images of the streetscape of District 4 (closer to city centre) and
Binh Thanh (suburbs) in Figs. 3 and 4 respectively. District 4 (on the left in Fig. 3) is more densely populated and is well used by
pedestrians. This area is known to be a “street food paradise” by locals, o<U+FB00>ering a multitude of food choices. However, the street
vendors are often considered to be obstructing the sidewalk, and the rubbish they generate is considered to be unsightly. However,
lack of regulation, and construction sites (on the right in Fig. 3) could render the sidewalks closed, with pedestrians being forced to
walk on the roads with motorcycle/vehicular tra<U+FB03>c. Binh Thanh is more suburban in nature. Some streets (on the left in Fig. 4) are
more attractive for active travel with street vendors and shade, however motor scooters remain the dominant transport mode. This

street’s (on the right in Fig. 4) sidewalk is non-existent, occupied by vehicles and shops, with a muddy and uneven road. The most
reported usual mode of travel undertaken by our participants is motorcycle, followed by walking and cycling. Bus and car use is very
low. Di<U+FB00>erent districts display disparity in reported mode use. More a<U+FB04>uent districts tend to have higher motorcycle use, but this is
mixed. Most motorcyclists reported that they were passengers, with some rare cases (up to 0.2%) of self-driving, which indicates
driving without a licence. Public transport and taxi usage is extremely low.
    In considering the nature of the data, we employed both correlation and binary logistic regression to identify the possible re-
lationship between the variables. Similar approaches have been identi<U+FB01>ed in prior active travel survey studies (Feng, 2016;
Nkurunziza et al., 2012; Pojani and Boussauw, 2014; Villanueva et al., 2013). We <U+FB01>rst calculated the Pearson correlation coe<U+FB03>cient
of the district aggregates (averages) of the variables to establish their possible relationships, then a binary logistic regression model
was used. The dependent variable is whether the respondent’s usual mode is active (walking or cycling), to which a binary value of 1
is assigned. This is tested against other independent variables, as outlined in Table 2. The interpretation of the results is based on the
odds ratio (OR). We also tested the multicollinearity properties of the sets of explanatory variables to avoid spurious and erroneous
modelling. The variance in<U+FB02>ation factor (VIF) was used. An exclusion cut-o<U+FB00> of VIF signalling multicollinearity in logistic regression
is 2.5 or higher (Midi et al., 2010). All of the selected variables had VIF values between 1.0 and 2.3.


4. Results

    The correlation analysis at district level shows the overall interrelationship between the variables. Due to the number of variables,
instead of a correlation matrix, we present the data in the form of a correlation network diagram created by the Gephi software, as
shown in Fig. 5.
    To allow for clearer presentation, only the pairs with correlation value over 0.6 are shown in the form of red1 and blue lines
(edge). The blue lines denote positive correlations while the red lines denote negative correlations. Thicker lines denote higher
correlation and vice versa for thinner lines. Statistically signi<U+FB01>cant pairs are marked (** = p = 0.01, * = p = 0.05). Only two travel
mode-related variables <U+FB01>ts have pairs over 0.6 – active mode frequency and motorcycle mode share. The circles (node) are based on
the overall correlation value with other variables (weighted network degree, WND), and are colour coded by their type. A larger

circle would imply higher overall correlation with other variables. Of particular interest are the correlation pairs of the travel
variables, as they re<U+FB02>ect travel behaviour. Street vendors, preference for travelling with peers and short travel distance are positively
correlated with district level active travel frequency; whereas income and prior tra<U+FB03>c injury experience are negatively correlated
with it. For district level motorcycle mode share, income is positively correlated, as is parents’ ability to drive children. It is also
correlated with negative aspects of active travel, such as excessive tra<U+FB03>c. The variables (nodes) with the highest correlation network
degree value are “parent allows IM” (WND = 31.78), followed by “active travel if distance is short” (WND = 31.25) and “obstacle
free paths” (WND = 28.49). These variables have mostly positive correlations with others. “Prior active tra<U+FB03>c injury” has the fourth
highest degree value (WND = 28.25) and has negative correlations with other active travel related variables and is positively cor-
related with “parent able to drive me” and “fear of tra<U+FB03>c injury”.
     While the district level correlation shows some of the interrelation of variables, it does not suggest causation, nor re<U+FB02>ect in-
dividual level variations. To address this, binary logistic regression is employed and the results are presented in Table 4. Individual
regression results are similar to those for district level correlation, but more variables are shown. In our sample, age is not found to be
a signi<U+FB01>cant variable and is not included in regression analysis. This is probably due to the rather narrow range of ages surveyed
(11–16 years old). Those who reported that they usually travel actively are also more likely to travel actively at higher frequency
(OR = 1.47). Built environment variable associations are higher urban density (OR = 1.41), lower road density (OR = 0.5), better
pathway quality (free of obstruction (OR = 1.29) or with tree cover (OR = 1.35)) and availability of open spaces in neighbourhood
for exercising (OR = 1.38). In a hot and humid climate, trees and shade can help improve comfort in active travel, which is con<U+FB01>rmed
by this survey and statistical analysis. Pedestrian or cyclist dedicated pathways are a rare sight HCMC, except in District 1. Virtually
all the roads in HCMC share active and motorised tra<U+FB03>c. Higher road supply might imply more tra<U+FB03>c and less favourable conditions
for adolescents’ active travel. The presence of street vendors is a variable that is unique in Vietnam and in developing countries. Their
presence in the neighbourhood (OR = 1.35) and on the route to school (OR = 1.32) are also associated with active travel but they
also cause obstruction to pathways, which has a negative impact (OR = 0.74). This complements the <U+FB01>ndings of Carver et al. (2005),
which suggests that convenience stores near homes are positively associated with active travel at weekends.
     Shorter travel distances for active travel are strongly preferred by respondents (OR = 2.69), a<U+FB03>rming prior studies (Carver et al.,
2005; Cole et al., 2007; Emond and Handy, 2012; Martens, 2004; Schlossberg et al., 2006; Sirard and Slater, 2008; Sjolie and Thuen,
2002). Other individual variables that are associated with active travel are feeling comfortable about travelling alone (2.19), while
there is a lesser preference when considered to be a form of recreation (OR = 1.67). Wider environmental variables such as hot

weather (OR = 0.5) and tra<U+FB03>c exhaust air pollution are also negatively associated with active travel (OR = 73), which is not as

con<U+FB01>rming prior studies in both both developed (Garrard, 2009; McMillan et al., 2006; O’Brien et al., 2000), and developing country
settings (Amornsriwatanakul et al., 2017; Oyeyemi et al., 2014; Peltzer, 2009) and also locally in HCMC (Trang et al., 2012).
    The reasons against females walking or cycling unaccompanied could be because of safety concerns. Female adolescents in
developing countries also tend to be more restricted due to cultural norms (Trang et al., 2012). In Nigeria (Oyeyemi et al., 2014),
there are gender constructed expectations that females undertaking active travel are frowned upon. Income is negatively associated
with active travel (0.6) and this con<U+FB01>rms other <U+FB01>ndings, such those as from HCMC (Trang et al., 2012), Australia (Rachele et al.,
2015), China (Shi et al., 2006) and South Africa (Lennox et al., 2008). Peers, parents and communities may serve as role models – if
they are more willing to conduct active travel, so do the adolescents as well. Peers are of particular importance, as active travel o<U+FB00>ers
opportunities for social interaction (Emond and Handy, 2012) and this is also con<U+FB01>rmed in our study. Parents being able to take their
children as passengers on motorised modes are likely competing with active travel opportunities (OR = 0.5). The role model e<U+FB00>ect
from parents (OR = 1.44), peers (active travel for leisure, OR = 2.46; active travel to school, OR = 2.12) and neighbourhoods
(OR = 1.27) is evident if they also travel actively. The accompaniment of peers makes active travel more likely by making it safer and
more enjoyable, as expressed in the preference for having peers during active travel rather than being alone (OR = 2.34). The
availability of peers is also important (OR = 1.98). In HCMC, tra<U+FB03>c has a negative association with the likelihood of active travel, in
particular if the respondent feels that motorists are oblivious (0.47) and if they have witnessed road trauma (OR = 0.49). Parents are
also quite likely to warn their children about strangers if they travel actively (OR = 0.59), as the kidnapping of children or youth is
perceived by many parents in Vietnam as being a threat. Discouraging active travel because of parental concerns about safety is also
evident in the UK (Jones et al., 2000).

5. Limitations and further research opportunities

    This study has some limitations. The design of the study is explorative rather than being fully representative. We hope future
attempts will be able to conduct a better survey design that covers a larger area, with larger sample sizes, or wider age ranges. More
sophisticated methods could be employed, such as structural equation modelling, as performed in other youth active travel studies
(Van Acker et al., 2010). Our trip data is also rather simplistic, o<U+FB00>ering only usual mode and active travel frequency. Alternative and
innovative data collection methods which allow for better trip details should be considered in future studies, such as using GPS
devices to track children’s active travel and actual distances. This approach was employed in a study in Perth, Australia (Babb et al.,
2017). Further studies should investigate how disadvantaged households are travelling di<U+FB00>erently, in comparison with more ad-
vantaged households in Vietnam (Veitch et al., 2017). In this study, like other mobility culture studies, we are not able to measure the
e<U+FB00>ects of wider political or urban planning decisions due to the di<U+FB03>culty of associating these decisions with adolescents’ travel
behaviour and perceptions. Such a study would require some form of longitudinal analysis. Nevertheless, the <U+FB01>ndings of this study
o<U+FB00>er new local knowledge, and could help policy makers in Vietnamese cities, or similar cities, to devise better urban and transport
planning activities.

6. Discussion and concluding remarks

    This study is likely the <U+FB01>rst of its kind in HCMC and has provided valuable insights on the active travel of adolescents, based on a
wide range of their perceptions of environmental (built and natural) and social (personal, peers, parenting, and neighbourhood)
factors. We have presented the mobility culture aspect of youths’ active travel in HCMC. We found that the respondents showed a
strong preference for active travel if the distances were shorter. However, this is restricted by numerous barriers. The mobility culture
in Vietnam today does not promote active travel. Active travel policy guidelines are usually available in developed countries (Bauman
et al., 2002) but this is not as developed in Vietnam. At a macro-scale level, Vietnamese transport policy makers should consider
greater investment in public transport and private vehicle restraint policies. This is already underway in HCMC, as the underground
metro railway is currently under construction and is aiming to commence operations in 2020. To reduce the impacts of tra<U+FB03>c (air
pollution and unsafe roads), private vehicle restraints should be considered in order to curb motorisation. This is actually possible in
the Vietnamese context, as the touristic city of Hoi An is able to restrict car use and only allows active transport in the historic town
area. This links to urban design or physical environment solutions – the inclusion of cycle tracks and walking infrastructure is an

                                                                             64

important strategy (Sjolie and Thuen, 2002). Vietnamese cities should consider ramping up pedestrian and cycle paths and im-
provements to intersections to facilitate active travel by children and adults alike, as many of this infrastructure is in poor condition.
Street vendors and their wares o<U+FB00>er an attraction to active travel but also obstruct pathways. This requires better urban management
and self-regulation of vendors. As a tropical city, better shading and tree cover would improve active travel comfort and also help
alleviate the negative impacts of air pollution and visual amenity. Other solutions include enforcing tra<U+FB03>c laws and promoting safer
driving behaviour, addressing the PTW culture by the use of incentives (e.g., higher taxes or road pricing). Currently, there is a stigma
on people who are not using motorised transport and this has to be reversed. For adolescent speci<U+FB01>c solutions, the mobilisation of
parents in the community can act as e<U+FB00>ective lobby groups – to petition local authorities to improve key pathways surrounding
schools or major junctions, as advocated in other cities (Ziviani et al., 2004). Another solution is active travel intervention programs,
by using social planning, marketing interventions or even gami<U+FB01>cation at school level to promote and incentivise active travel
(Anable, 2010; James et al., 2017; Pang et al., 2017). Better research on youth travel and their perception may help the developing of
these programs. There is much space for added knowledge in this area, and we hope further studies in developing countries can help
improve active travel of young people.
