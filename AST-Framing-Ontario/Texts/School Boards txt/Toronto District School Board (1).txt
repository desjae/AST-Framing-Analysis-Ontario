TDSB Charter for Active, Safe and Sustainable Transportation
Students and staff get to and from school every day by walking, cycling, mobility devices, and many other
forms of human-powered transportation. Research shows that those who use active and sustainable modes
of transportation experience benefits to mental and physical health and well-being, are better prepared to
learn and work and are more connected to their communities. At the TDSB we support and promote safe,
active, and sustainable transportation and our charter reflects the principles of Ontario’s Foundation for a
Healthy School.

Charter for Active, Safe and Sustainable Transportation

The TDSB will:

 invest resources to support active, safe and sustainable transportation to and from school, including efforts
 made within the school itself;
 identify and remove barriers to getting to and from school actively by partnering with stakeholders to
 work as a coordinated team;
 connect students' active transportation to and from school to their learning in health, environmental,
 technological, and physical education, and other curriculum areas;
 collaborate with internal and external partners to facilitate the implementation of school travel plans and
 road safety education along with other measures to expand on existing programs within schools and;
 increase students' overall physical activity and mental health through positive interactions with peers,
 parents, and staff.
