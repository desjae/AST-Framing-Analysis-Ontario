                               When buses are cancelled SCDSB schools will remain open for student learning, as
                               in previous years. It is always a family decision whether or not it is safe for your
                               child(ren) to leave for school under severe weather conditions.

                               This year, please note that students who are unable to attend school due to
                               bus cancellations will be able to access learning materials on the digital learning
                               platform assigned by their teacher, either Desire2Learn (D2L) or Google Classroom.
                               Students in the Learn@Home program will continue with regular programming as
                               scheduled.

                             Which Inclement Weather Zone is my school in?

                             Cancellations on Bus Cancellation Days
                             If professional development (PD) is scheduled for in-person attendance and is in an
                             impacted weather zone(s), it will be cancelled for that/those zone(s) only. Staff from
                             those affected areas will need to determine whether it is safe to drive to the PD site. All
                             virtual learning sessions will occur regardless of inclement weather status.


                             Bus Cancellation Decision Process
                             The Simcoe County Student Transportation Consortium in conjunction with the bus
                             operators will make the decision to cancel school buses before the start of the school
                             day, usually before 6 a.m. The SCSTC will make every effort to post announcements
                             between 6 and 7 a.m. with the local radio stations, on the SCSTC website and on
                             SCSTC's Twitter. Parents should also note that inclement weather cancellations are
                             effective for the whole day and buses cancelled in the morning will not run at the end
                             of the day.
